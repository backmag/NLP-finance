       " 'text': [' ANCHORAGE, Alaska  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) offered \\nto pay a $20 million fine and relinquish some leases to the \\nstate of Alaska to resolve a dispute over a North Slope oil and \\ngas field that has remained undeveloped for decades, according \\nto a letter made public on Friday. \\n\\n  In a proposal sent earlier this week to the Alaska \\nDepartment of Natural Resources, Exxon Mobil offered to pay the \\nfine and surrender about 20,000 acres of the 116,000-acre Point \\nThomson unit for failure to develop the field as quickly as \\npromised.  The company\\'s offer was accompanied by an updated plan that \\nlinks future field development to a yet-to-be-built pipeline \\nthat would ship North Slope natural gas to the lower 48 U.S. \\nstates. The natural gas pipeline, a massive project estimated \\nto cost over $20 billion, is expected to take years to build.  \"We believe this approach is in the best interest of the \\nState and the PTU (Point Thomson Unit) Owners,\" wrote Richard \\nOwen, Alaska production manager for Exxon Mobil.  Point Thomson holds 250 million to 300 million barrels of \\nliquids, both natural gas condensates and oil, according to \\nstate officials. It also holds 8 trillion cubic feet of \\nconventional natural gas.  Some of the 46 leases in the Point Thomson unit were \\nacquired as early as 1965, and more than half were acquired \\nbefore 1970, according to state information.  Exxon Mobil and its partners -- BP Plc ( BP.L ), Chevron \\n( CVX.N ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) -- risk losing nearly all \\nthe Point Thomson leases if the state finds the new offer \\ninsufficient.  The state can trigger revocation action if it deems the \\ncompany\\'s new development plan unacceptable and if Exxon Mobil \\nfails in appealing an earlier ruling that it has defaulted on \\nterms of its leases, Bill Van Dyke, acting director of the \\nstate Division of Oil and Gas, said earlier this week.  Normally, state oil and gas leases expire after five to 10 \\nyears if there has been no commercial development, but the unit \\nhas been granted many extensions.  The Point Thomson leases, aggregated into an oil-field \\nunit, have been the subject of nearly two dozen development \\nplans. The reserves were discovered in 1977.  Last year, Mark Myers, former director of the Alaska \\nDivision of Oil and Gas, ruled that Exxon Mobil had defaulted \\non its Point Thomson leases. The company had reneged on an \\nagreement signed with the state in 2001 to start drilling seven \\ndevelopment wells by specific deadlines, Myers said.  \"Continuing this 30-year record of non-development and \\ndelay of an oil and gas lessee\\'s obligation to develop and \\nproduce its oil and gas lease makes a mockery of the statutory, \\nregulatory and contractual protections for the State as owner \\nof the oil and gas estate,\" Myers wrote in his 2005 decision \\nthat launched the state\\'s current showdown with Exxon Mobil.  Exxon Mobil has until November 3 to appeal the state\\'s \\ndefault declaration, and a hearing on the appeal is scheduled \\n10 days after that, state officials said.',\n",
       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts \\nraced to outdo one another on Friday in raising stock price \\ntargets on Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ), with the most aggressive \\nsaying $600 does not look extreme for the Internet market \\nleader. \\n\\n  Brokers were responding to quarterly results on Thursday \\nthat showed Google revenue rising 70 percent -- two to three \\ntimes faster growth than rivals like Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) -- as \\nthe company tightened its grip on the Web search market.  Shares of Google closed up 7.9 percent to $459.67 on Nasdaq \\nFriday, with analysts saying the stock could hit $500 in short \\norder.  Citigroup raised its price target to $600 from $550, or 40 \\ntimes the broker\\'s 2008 earnings estimate on Google of $15.12 \\nper share. Others boosting targets included Goldman, \\nPrudential, Merrill, UBS, WR Hambrecht, and Stifel Nicolaus.  \"We are raising our (price target) to $500 and think the \\nstock will get there soon,\" UBS analyst Ben Schachter said in a \\nnote to clients. \"It may even trade above those levels by the \\nend of the year,\" he said, while advising caution above $500.  The rush to justify higher price targets on Google marks a \\nvindication for Google\\'s most bullish analyst, Safa Rashtchy of \\nPiper Jaffray, who had set a $600 target on January 2, only to \\nsee the stock plummet to levels as low as $330 in March.  \"$600 certainly feels a lot closer and more real now,\" \\nRashtchy told Reuters. \"I never thought it was totally out of \\nthe question. It was just a matter of time.\"  Rashtchy\\'s aggressive target was held out for ridicule by \\nInternet bears who saw a new era of dot-com excess in the \\nmaking -- recalling the late 1990s when analysts predicted \\neye-popping prices of $400 and even $1,000 for hot stocks. Even \\na friend of his joked: \"$600 was the kiss of death for you.\"\\n  NEW AD MARKETS  Internet stocks suffered a general exodus of funds earlier \\nthis year that pushed the sector down as much as 20 percent.  While concerns about slowing growth and greater competition \\nin the sector remain, Google\\'s standout results means money \\nmanagers may bypass struggling Yahoo in favor of Google through \\nthe end of 2006 and into early 2007, Rashtchy argues.  \"Now they will come back and when they come back they will \\nput more of their dollars on Google,\" he said.  Google\\'s cheerleaders say they are wowed by strong revenue \\nand heady profit growth, which comes despite heavy investments \\nin hiring and capital equipment. The company is making more \\nmoney from text advertisements and appears poised to expand \\ninto a variety of new ad markets including video.  Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto told clients that \\nGoogle\\'s view that \"Business is very...good\" should be \\nconsidered a major understatement. He reiterated a $525 \\nend-2006 target and set a new 12-month-out target of $595.  Ahead of Thursday\\'s results, the consensus target on Google \\nshares was for $499.20 among 25 financial analysts surveyed by \\nReuters Estimates. Following the company\\'s strong third-quarter \\nfinancial report, the consensus target moved up to $520.24.  Some analysts said institutional investors, more careful \\nnow after the heady 1990s, tend to ignore the attention paid by \\nthe media and retail investors to such figures. In reality, an \\ninvestor who buys 100 shares of a $45 stock is paying no more \\nfor 10 shares of Google at $450.  \"The sophisticated investor is not paying attention to \\nthat. I\\'m sure a lot would like to see it go to $600 but some \\nsellside analyst\\'s price target does not embolden that,\" said \\nPeter Boockvar, equity strategist with Miller Tabak & Co.  \"$600 is just a price,\" agreed Rashtchy. \"Think about it as \\n$60. If Google was at $45 and we said $60 nobody would have \\nblinked an eye,\" he said.  (Additional reporting by  Chris Sanders  in New York)',\n",
       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Internet service provider AOL\\'s sales \\nmay shrink for the next two years as it gives away services to \\nwin more users and attract advertising, its chief executive \\nsaid in an interview published on Saturday. \\n\\n  \"Maybe another two years, you are right there,\" Jonathan \\nMiller said when asked by German newspaper Die Welt whether \\nsales would continue to fall. \"But it\\'s about profitability for \\nus in this phase.\"  \"In the past, we invested a lot of money in the \\ninfrastructure for the access business and in winning \\ncustomers. That\\'s over now. Later, sales should rise again,\" \\nMiller said.  Miller said AOL, a unit of U.S. media group Time Warner \\n( TWX.N ), made profits of 20 to 25 percent of sales in its \\nInternet access business but more than 50 percent in its \\nadvertising business.  In recent weeks, AOL has sold its Internet access units in \\nGermany, France and Britain for a total of almost $2 billion as \\nit reshapes itself into a free Web portal where popular e-mail \\nand entertainment services are supported by advertising.  Time Warner\\'s online advertising revenues jumped 40 percent \\nto $449 million in the second quarter, bolstering its strategy. \\nBut AOL\\'s sales dropped 2 percent to $2 billion due to a \\ndecline in subscription revenue as it lost paying customers.  Miller said AOL wanted to expand its European presence and \\naimed to be represented in most of the continent\\'s countries \\nwith its own Internet portal and advertising network in five \\nyears\\' time.  Asked whether a sale by Time Warner of AOL was now off the \\nagenda, Miller said: \"For companies, nothing is ever completely \\noff the table. But it also doesn\\'t make much sense. Most media \\ncompanies are looking for a way into the digital business.\"  He said an initial public offering for AOL, after Time \\nWarner\\'s announcement this week that it would float its cable \\nTV unit, was \"an option.\"  Miller said he expected further industry consolidation in \\nthe wake of Google\\'s ( GOOG.O ) deal to buy video site YouTube \\nfor $1.65 billion earlier this month and News Corp.\\'s NWS.N \\n$580 million acquisition of online music and dating firm \\nMySpace.com.  He said AOL would \"definitely\" be a buyer, and that the \\ncompany was looking at various companies, including in Europe.  Miller said he had had talks with U.S. social networking \\nsite Facebook, the only hot U.S. Internet property left of any \\nsize, but had decided not to bid for it.  Facebook has been reported to be in discussions to be sold \\nto Yahoo ( YHOO.O ) for close to $1 billion.  \"In the end, it\\'s a question of price,\" Miller said. \"One \\nconsequence of Google\\'s acquisition of YouTube is that no one \\nwants to sell under the price they think they can get. The game \\nis becoming ever more expensive.\"',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The central bank is expected to hold \\ninterest rates steady for the third straight month when it \\nmeets on Tuesday and Wednesday and repeat warnings on \\ninflation, even though economists see little chance it will \\nhike again. \\n\\n  The Federal Reserve will probably make only minor changes \\nto the statement accompanying its decision to maintain rates at \\n5.25 percent, retaining a tightening bias to keep inflation \\nexpectations at bay while slower growth saps price pressures.  \"The Fed wants to talk like a hawk and walk like a dove,\" \\nsaid Josh Stiles, senior strategist at IDEA in New York.  Policy-makers say they think price pressures will moderate \\nas slower growth creates a bit more slack in the economy.  On the other hand, recent data have not given them much \\nincentive to change their anti-inflation rhetoric, even if some \\nof them privately don\\'t see the risks to inflation as high.  September\\'s core consumer price index, which strips out \\nenergy and food prices, rose 0.2 percent from August, soothing \\nfears it might have been higher. But it is still running near \\nto 3 percent on a yearly basis, well above the 1 percent to 2 \\npercent comfort zone voiced by a number of Fed policymakers.  \"The action paragraph in the statement will stay the same \\n... maintaining the bias to tightening,\" said former Fed \\nGovernor Lyle Gramley.  He did not see this anxiety over prices translating into \\nhigher interest rates, at a time when the U.S. economy is \\ncoping with a cooling housing market.  \"The Fed is going to be patient. ... It is a soft economy \\nand one in which you certainly would not want to be aggressive \\nin fighting inflation,\" he said.  The first reading of the performance of the U.S. economy in \\nthe third quarter is due Friday and is forecast by Wall Street \\nanalysts to show growth slowing to a 2.2 percent annual pace \\nfrom 2.6 percent in the previous three months.  Weaker growth and falling energy prices ought curb core \\nprices. However, the Fed will continue to keep warning of risks \\nto this outlook to make sure that expectations for future \\ninflation remain in check.  \"Most policy-makers probably believe that they can sit on \\nthe sidelines for quite some time. But they have decided to \\nemphasize concerns about inflation,\" said James Glassman, \\nsenior economist at JPMorgan Chase in New York.  This strategy has helped to temper bets in financial \\nfutures markets that the Fed will cut rates at the start of \\nnext year, although dealers polled by Reuters do still forecast \\na move to 5.0 percent on the federal funds rate target in \\nsecond quarter of 2007.

The government is mediating between the company and the \\nAchuar Indian community to try to bring an end to the protest, \\nwhich began more than two weeks ago, but talks continued on \\nSaturday without coming to a resolution.  \"At this moment we have stopped producing some 40,000 \\nbarrels per day, at $58 or $60 per barrel, that means lost \\nsales of $2.4 million a day approximately,\" Roberto Ramallo, \\ngeneral manager of Pluspetrol Norte, told Reuters.  The government had said on Friday it expected the protest \\nwould end on Saturday but Ramallo said armed indigenous groups \\nremained at the company\\'s oil fields.  \"Tomorrow (Sunday) at midday we should have an agreement, \\nor failed talks,\" he said.  Ramallo said protesters had freed some small wells, which \\nmeant the company had recovered some production.

The two sides agreed to launch the talks at a summit in \\nSeptember when the EU dismayed rights groups by agreeing to \\ndeal with business in a relatively independent manner amid \\nChinese warnings against linking trade to human rights.\\n  HUMAN RIGHTS  The trade policy paper will accompany a broader European \\nCommission report on overall EU-China ties expected to note \\nsome progress by Beijing on rights while urging it to do more.  After a latest exchange on rights on Thursday, the EU noted \\nChina\\'s commitment to ratify the U.N. Covenant on Civil and \\nPolitical Rights and reform its criminal justice system.  But it expressed deep concern over continuing restrictions \\non freedom of expression and the jailing of rights activists, \\nlawyers and journalists.  Trade ties have been tested recently by EU moves to slow \\nsome of China\\'s exports and the EU is suing China at the World \\nTrade Organization for what it says are unfair barriers in the \\nauto sector.  Mandelson, an avowed free-trader, has called on China to \\nmeet its responsibilities as the third-biggest global trader. \\nIts EU trade surplus soared past 100 billion euros ($126 \\nbillion) in 2005 and is running about 25 percent higher in \\n2006.  The pace of China\\'s growth has left the EU\\'s previous 2003 \\nreport on bilateral ties looking outdated, EU officials say.  Tuesday\\'s paper will spell out the bloc\\'s main complaints, \\nincluding limits on foreign ownership such as in the auto \\nsector, counterfeiting, and barriers to China\\'s public \\nprocurement market, the EU official said.  It will also urge China to move away more quickly from \\nbeing an export-driven economy and instead spur domestic \\ndemand, a shift EU policy-makers hope will slow China\\'s trade \\nsurpluses and ease strains on the global economy while creating \\nopportunities for foreign investors.

       "  ' \\n  (Adds analyst comment, closing stock activity)      By  Emily Kaiser       CHICAGO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on Monday it plans to slow U.S. store expansion and spending growth next year in a bid to boost its returns on investment, sending its stock up nearly 4 percent.      But the world\\'s biggest retailer also said October sales were running below plan, in part because it underestimated how badly remodeling efforts at hundreds of its U.S. stores had disrupted business. That tempered enthusiasm for the stock, which had been up more than 5 percent earlier in the session.      Wal-Mart said it expects its retail space to grow by 7.5 percent in the next fiscal year -- which begins Feb. 1 -- a modest slowdown from the 8 percent increases in recent years.      \"This is definitely what Wall Street was looking for,\" said Ken Turlington, research director and portfolio manager with McDaniel & Co., as he toured a Wal-Mart store in Fishkill, New York, during Wal-Mart\\'s two-day analyst meeting.      Capital spending is expected to be up 2 percent to 4 percent, well below the 15 percent to 20 percent increase expected in the current fiscal year.      \"We\\'re still dedicated to growing the business,\" Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said at the start of the analyst meeting in Teaneck, New Jersey. \"We\\'re looking at our projects differently. We\\'re prioritizing differently. We can still grow very rapidly but ... there\\'s a lot more concern about capital efficiency.\"      Wall Street has urged the company to slow its U.S. expansion because of dwindling returns, noting that Wal-Mart\\'s stock has been in a rut for about five years.      The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said it would delay opening new stores that are close enough to existing locations to draw away customers, and planned to build smaller ones where possible to reduce costs.      Schoewe said construction and real estate costs had soared, making new stores less profitable. He estimated that one dozen to two dozen stores were pared from the list of openings originally planned for next year.      The slowdown was not necessarily permanent, however, and Wal-Mart would look to accelerate expansion once again if costs came down, Schoewe said. The company will begin looking at its store opening plans for 2008 in January.      BIG-CITY PUSH      Richard Hastings, retail analyst with Bernard Sands, said the slowdown comes as 44-year-old Wal-Mart faces a maturing home market and sets its sights on major urban areas, where both costs and community opposition are higher.      \"They\\'ve run out of the kinds of rural and suburban inexpensive lease locations that they enjoyed for so many years,\" Hastings said.      The retailer plans to open more than 600 stores worldwide next year, about half of them outside the United States.      Todd Slater, retail analyst with Lazard Capital Markets, said the decrease in U.S. square footage growth should boost sales at stores open at least a year, which have trailed those of rival Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) in recent years. He raised his price target on the stock to $59 from $54.      Despite tighter cost controls, the retailer said it was pressing on with efforts to remodel some 1,800 stores, or about half the U.S. chain, but acknowledged that the store disruption was hurting sales in the short term.      Wal-Mart said October\\'s same-store sales were up about 1 percent so far, below its forecast for 2 percent to 4 percent growth. Women\\'s apparel sales were lackluster as customers shunned fashionable items such as skinny-leg pants.      The stock closed up $1.91 at $51.28 on the New York Stock Exchange after peaking at $52.15 earlier in the session, the highest level since February 2005.      Wal-Mart\\'s stock has been under pressure in recent weeks following disappointing sales growth in September. Its shares trade at 15.1 times analysts\\' profit forecasts for next year, compared with 16.3 times for Target.  Lazard\\'s Slater said despite the near-term sales disappointment, Wall Street\\'s earnings estimates for 2007 may be too low. \"With estimates rising and increased focus on return on invested capital and cash flow, the company\\'s multiple should expand\" to 18 times earnings, he wrote in a note to clients.

       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. on Monday posted a quarterly loss of $5.8 billion -- its largest loss in 14 years -- as slower truck sales, charges for job cuts and asset write-downs in its troubled North American operations and elsewhere took their toll on the No. 2 U.S. automaker. \\n\\n Ford said it would restate results from 2001 through the second quarter and cautioned that operating results would weaken further in the current quarter. Ford also said it was considering raising new funding secured by its automotive assets in order to protect its cash position as it pays the bill to close 16 plants and cut up to 45,000 jobs. \"These business results are clearly unacceptable,\" said Chief Executive Alan Mulally, who took over at Ford in early September. Ford posted a net loss of $3.08 per share for the third quarter compared with a loss of $284 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. That included a battery of charges that totaled $4.6 billion after taxes, or $2.46 per share. Ford\\'s loss from continuing operations was 62 cents per share, matching analysts\\' average forecast as tracked by Reuters Estimates. Analysts have urged Mulally to consider further asset sales to protect Ford\\'s cash position, and in his first post-earnings conference call with analysts some credited him with a more open approach to the company\\'s turnaround. \"One of the things that\\'s positive about Mulally coming in is that nothing is sacred and he is willing to take a fresh look,\" said Morningstar analyst John Novak. Said Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan: \"Simply shrinking again is not necessarily the answer. Ford needs to become a company flexible enough to be profitable at lower production volumes on each line (and) on each platform.\" REVENUE DOWN, CASH IN FOCUS Revenue for the quarter was $36.7 billion, down $4.1 billion. Auto sales accounted for $32.6 billion of total revenue. High gasoline prices have caused U.S. consumers to shift away from sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, a segment that represents over 60 percent of Ford\\'s current sales. Ford ended the quarter with cash of $23.6 billion but said that total would drop near $20 billion by the end of the year as it restructures. Fitch Ratings, which placed Ford\\'s debt on watch for a downgrade on Monday, said the automaker needed to hold at least $15 billion in consolidated cash in order to avoid raising concern among suppliers and customers. Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair said Ford was \"exploring various financing strategies, including secured financing involving a substantial portion\" of its automotive operations. Ford is selling its British luxury brand Aston Martin. Leclair said the company is in the process of preparing a short list of bidders but does not expect to close a sale this year. Mulally also said Ford is open to reviewing its other luxury brands -- leaving the door open to a potential sale of Jaguar, Volvo or Land Rover. \"I really think it\\'s going to hinge on how the businesses are doing and can we make profitable growth businesses out of them with the action we have taken and additional actions that might be required,\" he said. BUYOUTS ON THE TABLE Ford is offering buyouts to all of its 75,000 unionized workers in a bid to reduce its factory work force by nearly half. The bulk of hourly workers taking buyouts to leave the company in the first and second quarter of 2007. About 4,000 employees at former Visteon Corp. factories, now grouped under Automotive Component Holdings, have already accepted buyouts, the company said. In the third quarter, Ford took pretax charges of $861 million for job cuts related to plant closings in North America, $259 million for job cuts elsewhere, and $437 million to pay out pensions earlier than planned . Ford also took pretax charges of $2.2 billion to write down the value of North American assets and $1.6 billion for the impairment of Jaguar and Land Rover assets. Ford Motor Credit\\'s net profit fell to $262 million from $577 million a year earlier in part because of higher financing costs driven by the parent company\\'s junk credit rating. \"The reduced profitability at Ford Motor Credit now shines a more intense light on the weakness of Ford\\'s fundamental operation -- the automotive business,\" Tynan said. Ford executives repeated that the company has no plans to sell its finance arm, although Leclair said the automaker would be open to partnerships in some markets. Shares of Ford were down 14 cents or 1.8 percent to $7.87 in early afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Jui Chakravorty  and  Kevin Krolicki  )',\n",
       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is still weighing what to do with its loss-making stable of European premium brands, which now have to prove they can make consistent profits, Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Monday. \\n\\n While Ford had done the right thing so far by investing in new vehicles, quality and productivity at its Premier Automotive Group (PAG), the new CEO said, he did not commit himself to maintaining the Jaguar, Volvo and Land Rover brands. \"No, I don\\'t,\" Mulally said when asked during a conference call if he had a feeling yet on whether to keep the brands. \"I really think it\\'s going to hinge on how the businesses are doing and can we make profitable growth businesses out of them with the action we have taken and additional actions that might be required.\" PAG\\'s pretax loss excluding one-off items widened to $593 million in the third quarter from $108 million for the same period in 2005 as the unit set aside money for Jaguar and Land Rover warranty costs, something Mulally called \"a setback\". Also sales volumes dropped for all the PAG brands except Aston Martin, which Ford has already put up for sale. Mulally, who became Ford CEO just last month, said the number two U.S. carmaker had a good plan in place to increase the PAG brands\\' value in the long term but that their future with the group was subject to \"continuing evaluation\". Ford has said in the past that only Aston Martin is a candidate for divestment at this stage. Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair told the call that Ford had received \"many, many inquiries\" about Aston Martin and was in the process of winnowing suitors down to a short list. \"There is a lot of interest, and we feel very good about how the process is going,\" he said, although he added that no sale was expected by the end of this year. Leclair also forecast that PAG\\'s results would improve substantially in the fourth quarter to near breakeven given higher production volumes and product launches from Volvo and Land Rover.',\n",
       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. has no plans to sell its finance arm although the automaker is open to partnerships in some markets, a senior executive said on Monday. \\n\\n \"Ford Credit is core asset, a strategic asset and we intend to hold onto it,\" Ford Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair said on Monday. But: \"There\\'s certain areas where having a complete full-line captive finance company doesn\\'t make as much sense,\" Leclair said in response to questions from analysts on a conference call to discuss the company\\'s third-quarter results. He cited a partnership Ford now has in Brazil that generates loan origination fees for the automaker\\'s finance arm, while lowering its funding costs, as a model that could be exported to other markets. Some Wall Street analysts have urged Ford to sell its finance arm Ford Motor Credit to raise cash for the restructuring of its loss-making auto operations.',\n",
       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. is committed to a review of all its products and brands as the No. 2 U.S. automaker tries to turn around its North American operations, Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Monday. \\n\\n The automaker will \"look at the entire product portfolio, at the investment decisions, to make the entire portfolio productive,\" Mulally told Reuters in an interview after the automaker posted a $5.8 billion third-quarter loss. \"I think that integrated look is going to be really good for Ford.\" When asked if the review will include domestic brands such as Mercury, Mulally said \"yes.\" Ford has been criticized for not moving fast enough to align its vehicle lineup with changing consumer tastes. Some analysts have suggested Ford drop its Mercury brand and sell its money-losing luxury Jaguar nameplate as it tries to return to profits through a sweeping restructuring -- its third attempt in five years -- that includes cutting nearly 45,000 employees and closing 16 plants. Mulally, a former Boeing Co. executive who took over as CEO from Bill Ford Jr. on September 5, said the company will keep making incremental changes to the revised plan dubbed \"Way Forward\" that was announced last month. Mulally said he looks at the status of Ford\\'s restructuring every Thursday in his weekly business plan review with senior executives. \"We look at the metrics of the business environment, travel, GDP growth, new housing starts, economy,\" Mulally said. \"Then we move to our strategy and then we move to the plan, which includes most of the elements of the income statement and the balance sheet.\" Credited for turning around Boeing\\'s commercial airplane business, Mulally said the idea is to keep tabs on the business environment so that the automaker can refine its present restructuring plan. Ford will be making \"continuous quality improvement in the plan,\" he said. Mulally is also focused on Ford\\'s product pipeline, which so far has been dominated by large pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles. Analysts and dealers have said that Ford needs to make a bigger push into areas it has been neglecting far too long -- fuel-efficient passenger cars and \"crossover\" vehicles that are lighter SUVs built on car platforms. High gas prices have cut deeply into demand for Ford\\'s profitable SUVs, like the Explorer, and the company\\'s market-leading F-Series pickup truck models are competing in the most-heavily discounted part of the market. \"The second part of the (restructuring) plan is to make sure that we have a very good product development plan to make the products that our customers really want going forward,\" Mulally said.',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks should extend their rally this week, taking the Dow to fresh records, as long as corporate earnings keep topping expectations and beat back concerns that equities have gotten a tad pricey recently. \\n\\n This week, which is smack in the middle of the third-quarter earnings reporting period, the Federal Reserve\\'s monetary policy committee meets and is expected to leave interest rates unchanged again, making the two-day meeting a likely nonevent for stocks. Investors will need to be cautious of huge, index-moving, swings like those of the shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ), which sorely disappointed investors with a smaller-than-expected profit and a poor outlook, and easily held the Dow in negative territory in Friday trading. A flood of earnings reports is expected. Companies due to report include American Express Co. ( AXP.N ), AT&T Inc. ( T.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ), Halliburton Co. ( HAL.N ), Kimberly-Clark Corp. ( KMB.N ), Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N, Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N and Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ). \"I think the fundamental earnings figures that are going to come out are going to be positive enough to keep us inching forward,\" said Brett Gallagher, deputy chief investment officer with Julius Baer in New York. Third-quarter earnings for Standard & Poor\\'s 500 companies are on pace to rise close to 15 percent from a year ago, according to Reuters Estimates. That would be the 17th straight quarter of double-digit profit growth for U.S. companies. \"As long as we have a combination of solid earnings, a market-friendly Fed and no geopolitical trepidation, gains in stocks may still continue,\" said Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group in Princeton, New Jersey. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its policy-setting committee meeting Oct 24-25. Yet when the market reaches key psychological levels, such as the Dow hitting a record high on October 3 after passing a nearly 7-year-old benchmark set during the Internet boom, or breaching the 12,000 level last week, it has caused investors to lock in profits and sell shares. \"A lot of people who look at breadth and technical nature of the markets say we are a bit overbought right now, so there could be a technical argument for why we pull back,\" Baer\\'s Gallagher added. Existing home sales data for September are due on Wednesday, a report on durable goods orders for September is expected Thursday and the final reading on October sentiment from the University of Michigan is due on Friday. \"The Fed meeting should really be a nonevent,\" said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. in San Francisco. He added that the housing data \"would have to be a very disruptive number to worry people.\" A sharp drop in crude oil prices since mid-July and the Fed\\'s decision to keep interest rates steady in its last two policy meetings have helped underpin the rally in stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  piercing the 12,000 milestone on Wednesday. Gains in International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ), which reported stronger-than-expected earnings late Tuesday, helped drive the Dow over the 12,000 mark the next day. U.S. stocks were little changed on Friday after industrial bellwether Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) missed earnings expectations and the heavy equipment maker lowered its outlook, offsetting a strong profit from Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) and the benefit of falling oil prices. For the week, the Dow gained 0.35 percent, S&P 500 rose 0.22 percent and the Nasdaq shed 0.64 percent. To be sure, not everyone thinks solid earnings alone will keep indexes moving higher. \"We are set for a pullback unless earnings guidance going forward continues to be strong. That\\'s what needs to happen. If that doesn\\'t happen, then this will be a short-lived rally,\" said Neil Massa, senior U.S. trader at MFC Global Investment Management.

       "  ' CALGARY/LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) has offered to buy the 22 percent of Shell Canada Ltd. SHC.TO it doesn\\'t already own for C$7.7 billion ($6.8 billion) to halt a slide in its reserves and expand its oil sands holdings, but one shareholder has said the offer is inadequate. \\n\\n Shell said in a statement on Monday it had advised the board of Shell Canada of its intention to buy out the minority interests for a cash price of C$40 a share, a 22 percent premium to Friday\\'s closing price. Struggling to rebuild its oil and gas reserves base after a more than 30 percent writedown in 2004 and poor exploration success in 2005, Shell has made massive investments in Canada\\'s oil sands, both directly and through Shell Canada. If it is successful with its offer, Shell will consolidate the oil sands operations of its Canadian unit, Canada\\'s No. 3 oil producer and refiner, and simplify its structure by consolidating a rare publicly traded subsidiary. As well, it will add Shell Canada\\'s 936 million barrels of proved and probable oil sands reserves . \"Once Shell Canada Limited is fully combined with the group, the business will benefit from a simplified organization, additional economies of scale and portfolio development in the context of the group\\'s global strategy,\" Royal Dutch Shell said in a statement. Shell Canada is the country\\'s third-largest oil sands producer and is in the midst of plans to expand its operations in Northern Alberta. The Athabasca oil sands contain about 174 billion barrels of recoverable heavy oil, the largest untapped resource outside Saudi Arabia. However, the heavy oil is difficult to extract and expensive to refine. Costs are also skyrocketing as a number of projects compete for materials and skilled labor. In July, Shell Canada rattled the industry and investors with word that the cost of a 100,000-barrel-a-day expansion of its Athabasca oil sands development had nearly doubled to as much as C$12.8 billion. Shell Canada shares jumped C$9.75, or 30 percent, to C$42.55 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Volume was about 24.4 million shares. Before the offer, Shell Canada\\'s stock had lost about 22 percent since the start of the year as the price of oil dropped and cost overruns deterred investors. C$40 \\'NOT SUFFICIENT\\' However, the bid is too low, according to one of the largest outside investors in Shell Canada. Garey Aitken, a portfolio manager at Bissett Investment Management in Calgary, which controls 3.7 million Shell Canada shares, said the $40 offer would need to be raised. \"I think, without having run all the numbers, that C$40 is not sufficient here,\" Aitken said. Still, one analyst said the offer was fair, given the costs of expanding the oil sands operations. \"I think $40 is pretty fair,\" said Martin Molyneaux, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital in Calgary. Shares in other oil sands firms also rose on news of the Shell offer. Imperial Oil Ltd. ( IMO.TO ), 69.6 percent owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), rose the most, gaining C$1.87, or 5.1 percent, to C$38.37, while Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. ( CNQ.TO ), which is building the Horizon oil sand project, climbed C$1.68, or 3 percent, to C$57.08. Royal Dutch Shell\\'s A shares fell 3 pence to 1763 pence in London. Under Chief Executive Clive Mather, Shell Canada has beefed up its oil sands holdings by acquiring BlackRock Ventures for C$2.4 billion last summer and setting long-term plans for its own Alberta bitumen leases. Its long-term goal is to produce 500,000 barrels a day of crude from the oil sands. Among its other operations, the company has a stake in the proposed Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline in Canada\\'s Arctic, which is also being hit with surging costs, and the Sable gas offshore project on the Atlantic coast. It also runs one of the country\\'s largest gasoline retail chains along with three refineries. Analysts said that while this deal would not boost production, as Shell Canada\\'s output is already fully included in Shell\\'s overall numbers, it could lead to accelerated expansion and higher output in the future. \"It does raise Shell\\'s exposure to Canadian tar sands, a high cost and overheated area, but one that offers material resource opportunity for a company struggling to grow production and rebuild its upstream,\" Citigroup said in a research note.

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - U.S. venture capital funding rose 5.4 percent in the first nine months of this year compared with 2005, led by investments in alternative energy and Internet technologies, a survey due out on Monday said. \\n\\n Venture capital investors directed $6.36 billion into 611 deals through the end of September, according to a quarterly report by Dow Jones VentureOne and Ernst & Young LLP. With $19.45 billion invested during the first three quarters, the U.S. venture industry is on track to spend around $25 billion in 2006, marking the biggest year since 2001, when $33 billion was invested. \"This is the first time since 2001 that we have seen three consecutive quarters in which investments exceeded $6 billion,\" said Joseph Muscat, Americas director of the Ernst & Young Venture Capital Advisory Group. Current levels are a little over one-third of the $63.4 billion spent in 2000 -- the peak year of the dot-com boom. Financings tripled for alternative energy companies, as venture capitalists backed 14 deals worth $110.2 million. Funding for information technology -- especially the latest generation of Internet start-ups known as \"Web 2.0\" -- grew 41 percent during the third quarter from the year-earlier period. More than $35 billion in new funds has been raised over the last 18 months, the VentureOne survey found. Thirty-eight percent of investment rounds in the latest quarter went to seed- or first-stage financings, the first quarter this year early-stage investment has outpaced later-stage rounds. Early-stage funding is up 13 percent over last year, led by health-care themes like biopharmaceuticals. Investors have taken heart from a lively acquisition market as larger buyers snap up smaller companies and from a recent pick-up in public markets for technology initial public offerings, VentureOne and Ernst & Young stated. But that contradicts recent data from Thomson Financial and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) that shows how only eight venture-backed companies raised $934.2 million via IPOs in the third quarter, the slowest quarter since 2003.

American Express shares staged their biggest one-day drop in percentage terms since October 2005. \"These numbers are everything I had been hoping for, but we\\'ve had a great run in the stock, and some people think it\\'s a good time to take profits,\" said Michael Holland, chairman of investment firm Holland & Co., which has over $1 billion of assets including American Express shares. American Express shares, even with Monday\\'s declines, are hovering near their 52-week highs, and have been rising steeply since July. Income from continuing operations, which excludes results from the Ameriprise Financial ( AMP.N ) advisory unit spun off last year, rose to $956 million, or 78 cents a share in the quarter ended September 30, from $865 million, or 69 cents a share in the same quarter last year. Excluding a $33 million gain from the sale of operations in Malaysia and Indonesia, and $12 million of restructuring costs, income from continuing operations was 77 cents per share, or a penny better than average analyst expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Credit card issuers including Capital One Financial Corp. ( COF.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ) have reported strong results from their credit card operations this quarter compared to the same quarter last year, helped by low write-offs of bad loans and in many cases rising consumer borrowing. But write-offs of bad loans are likely to creep higher in coming quarters as bankruptcy filings creep higher, Gary Crittenden, chief financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. Personal bankruptcy filings have been low in recent quarters, after spiking just before a new law went into effect last year. American Express has performed well for its sector, analysts said. The company\\'s market share in credit cards has been growing compared with rival processors like MasterCard Inc.

In the first nine months of 2006, the utility and energy sector was the fourth most active in mergers and acquisitions, while oil and gas ranked No. 7, according to research firm Dealogic. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The purchase is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Petrie Parkman, which operates in Houston, Denver and London and has about 50 professionals, last month filed for an initial public offering, aiming to raise up to $115 million. Keefe Bruyette & Woods had been listed as one of the underwriters. The move came as the market for oil and gas initial public offerings has contracted as oil prices slid from their peaks early this year and due to uncertainty about how natural gas prices will fare this winter. As deals have traded below their offering prices, others have been shelved. Petrie Parkman was one of the last of the larger independent energy advisory firms standing. Last year, Jefferies Group Inc. JEF.N bought Randall & Dewey, and Bank of Nova Scotia's ( BNS.TO ) Scotia Capital bought Waterous & Co., two Houston-based firms that focused on oil and gas asset sales. The move marks a return to Wall Street for the firm's founders, Jim Parkman and Tom Petrie, who started Petrie Parkman in 1989 along with head bankers Jon Hughes and Randy King. Parkman and Petrie were previously oil analysts at First Boston Corp., a predecessor to Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ), while Hughes worked in First Boston's mergers and acquisitions group. Keefe Bruyette served as adviser to Petrie Parkman in the deal with Merrill and provided a fairness opinion. Merrill represented itself.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N on Monday posted lower-than-expected sales growth due to weak sales of salad dressing and bottled beverages, dragging its stock down despite an 11 percent increase in quarterly profit. \\n\\n The company also raised its earnings outlook for the year, but only due to the expected gain from the sale of its Minute Rice brand. The maker of Oreo cookies, Maxwell House coffee and Kraft cheese posted a profit of $748 million, or 45 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with $674 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, Kraft earned 46 cents a share, compared with Wall Street analysts\\' average forecast of 45 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 2.3 percent to $8.24 billion. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $8.26 billion. Volume, a measure of goods sold, fell 1.9 percent. The revenue increase was smaller than the company reported for the second quarter. Some analysts were disappointed the company is not showing more steady improvement as it restructures. \"You take two steps forward and one step back,\" said Gregg Warren, analyst at Morningstar. The company\\'s sales were hurt by a 9 percent decline in North American ready-to-drink beverages like Fruit2O water and by consumers shying away from salads amid a massive recall of spinach due to deadly e.coli bacteria and a smaller recall of lettuce. \"This has been a tough year for salad dressings because of all the consumer news in lettuce and spinach,\" Kraft Chief Executive Officer Irene Rosenfeld said in an interview. She added that \"ready-to-drink (beverage) has been a competitive area and we have just not had the performance we expected.\" At the same time, the company has not produced the blockbuster new products it needs to keep growing, especially given its already large size. Aside from the company\\'s South Beach Diet products, the last successful major new line was DiGiorno pizza in the 1990s, Warren said. \"When you are a $32 billion company, you need a good handful of those to drive the needle,\" Warren said. Rosenfeld also was critical of the new product pipeline during a conference call with analysts, saying the company had successful products but others that were not real innovations. \"Too many of our innovations are what we would characterize as new to Kraft, but not new to the world,\" Rosenfeld said. Kraft has been in the process of closing plants and cutting jobs in order to rein in costs amid higher prices for energy, wheat and other commodities. It has also sold off some brands to focus on products like cookies, beverages and South Beach Diet meals. Analysts and investors await an announcement from Kraft\\'s parent, Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ), on when it plans to spin off the rest of Kraft\\'s stock and word from Rosenfeld about her strategy for running the largest North American food company. Rosenfeld, named CEO in June, declined to comment on specifics of her strategy for the company, saying she will talk more about her plans early next year. But she did say that the company would be ready to be spun off by Altria when the parent company decides to split Kraft and its Philip Morris tobacco businesses. Altria management has not said when the spin-off will happen, saying it is waiting for the U.S. legal environment in the tobacco business to improve. \"I am highly confident that whenever and if Altria decides to spin off Kraft, we will be ready,\" Rosenfeld said. Kraft raised its full-year earnings outlook to between $1.86 and $1.89 a share due to gains from the sale of its Minute Rice brand and its interest in United Biscuits. In July, the company boosted its forecast to $1.78 to $1.83 a share. Kraft shares were down 4 percent at $34.80 in extended trade Monday following the earnings release, after closing up 2.3 percent at $36.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wrigley is one of the few public companies that does not hold a conference call with analysts when it reports quarterly earnings. In fact, many analysts are in the habit of attending the company\\'s annual meeting because it affords one of the rare opportunities for analysts to asks questions of top management. \"We don\\'t see any change.

( NKE.N ) CEO William Perez as president and chief executive officer, immediately replacing Bill Wrigley Jr., who will assume the new role of executive chairman. The company also said quarterly profit rose, beating analysts\\' estimates. Analysts said the earnings report also helped lift the stock. In addition to his new post, Bill Wrigley, 43, will remain chairman of the board of the company that his great grandfather founded. \"In our view, by hiring William Perez ... as the company\\'s CEO, Chairman Bill Wrigley Jr. sees that significant changes are needed at Wrigley, which has been our thesis,\" Pablo Zuanic, analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, said in a research note. Perez, 59, has experience running a family business, having served as chief executive of household products maker S.C. Johnson & Sons from 1996 to 2004. But he moved from S.C. Johnson to Nike, where he clashed with founder and Chairman Philip Knight in a 13-month stint as chief executive of the athletic shoe and apparel company which ended in January. Still, the Wrigley job seems to be a good fit for Perez, who also brings experience selling branded consumer products in international markets. \"Wrigley, like S.C Johnson, is a collection of branded products that is sold in mass channels,\" Mitchell Corwin, analyst at Morningstar, said. \"There are more similarities between S.C. Johnson and Wrigley than S.C. Johnson and Nike. Bill Wrigley said on Monday that he will focus on long-term strategy and product innovation. Since Bill Wrigley became chief executive in 1999, the company\\'s sales have more than doubled to more than $4 billion, with acquisitions helping to expand the company beyond chewing gum and into candies like Life Savers and Altoids mints. ACQUISITION MISSTEPS But the Chicago-based company also stumbled over the 2005 Life Savers and Altoids acquisitions from Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N, finding that it needed to spend more than expected to increase sales of those brands. \"Missteps in the Kraft acquisition highlighted the need for somebody with more experience to lead the company going forward,\" Morningstar\\'s Corwin said. Wrigley has also had to take on even more day-to-day oversight of the company since April, when Chief Operating Officer Ronald Waters retired from the company early. \"I think he has recognized that with a company this size, it is difficult to be the chairman, CEO and COO at the same time,\" said Jon Henderson, associate analyst at William Blair & Co. \"I think he recognized he can\\'t do it all.\" As of February 6, Wrigley controlled 19.8 million shares, or 59.59 percent of Wrigley class \"B\" stock, which has 10 votes for each share, in various trusts for himself and his family, according to the company\\'s annual proxy report. He also controlled 14.2 million shares, or 7.55 percent, of the company\\'s class \"A\" stock, which carries one vote per share. The change at Wrigley comes a little more than a month after Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) replaced CEO William Clay Ford Jr., the great-grandson of that company\\'s founder. Separately, Wrigley also on Monday said third-quarter sales rose 11 percent to $1.18 billion, helped by a 30 percent increase in China and a 9 percent increase in the United States. Earnings for the period rose to $148.0 million, or 53 cents a share, from $129.7 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges, earnings were 55 cents a share. On that basis, analysts on average had forecast 51 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Wrigley shares were up $7.22 at $54.05 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Hasbro shares rose 3.4 percent to $24.10 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. The shares had risen 15 percent year-to-date through Friday, while Mattel shares had gained 37 percent. Hasbro, the No. 2 U.S. toymaker, said quarterly earnings rose to $99.6 million, or 58 cents per share, from $92.1 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had been expecting 50 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue increased 5 percent to $1.04 billion, beating analysts\\' average target of $970 million. Hasbro\\'s North American segment revenue, which includes sales of toys like Littlest Pet Shop, Playskool and Monopoly in the United States, Canada and Mexico, rose to $745.5 million from $712.3 million. The toy company said it shipped $69 million of \"Star Wars\" merchandise in the quarter, down $58 million from a year earlier. In 2005, sales of \"Star Wars\" items like lightsabers and action figures accounted for 16 percent of Hasbro\\'s revenue, boosted by the May 2005 release of the film \"Star Wars: Episode III-Revenge of the Sith.\" Sales of \"Star Wars\" products were expected to fall this year with no new movie set for release, but they have not declined as strongly as expected. \"I think Star Wars is really the Energizer Bunny of the toy industry. It just keeps going,\" said Gerrick Johnson, a toy analyst with BMO Capital Markets. SIGNS OF REVITALIZATION U.S. toymakers have faced years of lackluster sales, squeezed by higher manufacturing costs, intense price competition and electronic gadgets that are attracting children at younger and younger ages. But market research firm NPD Group says it is seeing signs of revitalization in the nation\\'s $22 billion toy market. \"The retail climate is better than we anticipated,\" Hasbro\\'s Verrecchia said. \"Most major retailers around the globe are cautiously optimistic about the holiday season. Thus far, the consumer has been spending, with retailers having a good back-to-school season.\" Mattel\\'s quarterly results were boosted by the introduction of its T.M.X. Elmo plush red doll, which has already become one of the season\\'s hottest toys, and improving sales of Barbie. Hasbro said it was seeing a strong response to the Monopoly: Here & Now Edition, released in September. The game is updated to resemble the present-day United States, with modern-day property values and playing pieces like a Toyota Prius and New Balance shoe. Hasbro\\'s international segment revenue rose to $280.4 million, including a $9.3 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, from $264.6 million a year earlier. Hasbro is working to decrease its dependence on Star Wars merchandise and could see strong sales of other movie-related products in 2007. The Transformers movie, based on its action figures, is set for release next summer. Hasbro also expects to add more toys in 2007 from its licensing deal with Marvel Entertainment Inc. MVL.N, the owner of characters like Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, X-Men and Captain America. The film Spider-Man 3 will hit theaters in 2007. Separately, Hasbro said it repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock during the third quarter. Since June 2005, it has repurchased 23.5 million shares.',\n",

( KMB.N ), the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, on Monday said third-quarter profit rose nearly 12 percent, but the quality of the results failed to impress Wall Street and its shares fell more than 2 percent. \\n\\n Kimberly-Clark also said its full-year profit should come in toward the lower end of prior expectations as it continues to feel pressure from higher costs for materials such as pulp. Such costs should be up more than $350 million this year, even though oil costs have fallen, Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas Falk said during a conference call. That\\'s up from the company\\'s original estimate of $200 million and the $300 million to $350 million forecast it gave in July. Kimberly-Clark is 15 months into a restructuring plan that includes cutting 6,000 jobs as it works to improve its diaper and health-care businesses and expand in emerging markets. The company\\'s report was the first look at quarterly results from a major U.S. household and personal care products company, with others, such as leader Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ), expected to report in the coming days. \"We are not thrilled with operating performance,\" said AG Edwards analyst Jason Gere, who rates the shares \"buy.\" Profit rose to $364.2 million, or 79 cents per share, from $325.3 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier. Kimberly-Clark attributed much of the increase to cost-cuts and growth at Mexico\\'s Kimber ( KIMBERA.MX ), in which it holds a minority stake. Before items, the Dallas-based company, which also makes Cottonelle, Scott and Viva paper products, earned 99 cents per share. Analysts had an average estimate of 98 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Pecoriello, who has an \"underweight\" rating on the shares, said that lower taxes and options added to the profit. Based on core operating profit, excluding charges and options, the results missed the Wall Street consensus by 2 cents per share, he said. Kimberly-Clark\\'s sales rose 5.2 percent to $4.2 billion, driven by sales growth in each of the company\\'s segments. But analysts said the sales growth was weak, excluding a boost of nearly 2 percent from foreign exchange rates. Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott said that Kimberly-Clark\\'s 3 percent \"organic\" sales growth is below expectations for a company in this sector. \"It supports the argument that Kimberly is in the wrong categories (e.g. tissue, diapers) and competitive set (P&G) for growth,\" said Hott, who rates the shares \"peer perform.\" Kimberly-Clark competes directly with P&G\\'s Pampers and Luvs diapers, Puffs tissues, Bounty paper towels, Charmin bathroom tissue and Tampax and Always feminine care products. The company said it is still working on turning around its Kotex women\\'s business, where volume declined, including new products that should hit stores in the current quarter. Consumer tissue volume also fell, but higher prices and currency led to a 3 percent sales increase. The company expects to earn $1 per share to $1.02 per share in the fourth quarter, and analysts, on average, call for a profit of $1.02 per share. Kimberly-Clark said it now expects to earn $3.87 per share to $3.89 per share this year. It had previously forecast a profit of $3.85 per share to $3.95 per share, and analysts expect a profit of $3.88 per share. The company said it plans to give a 2007 preview when it reports fourth-quarter results in late January. Shares of Kimberly-Clark were down 63 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $66.79 after falling to $65.89 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday as traders doubted all OPEC members would follow Saudi Arabia\\'s lead to curb output under an agreement reached last week. \\n\\n U.S. crude CLc1 settled down 52 cents at $58.81 a barrel. The front-month contract lost $1.68, more than 2 percent, on Friday to hit its lowest level this year. London Brent crude LCOc1 dropped 47 cents to $59.21. Top world oil exporter Saudi Arabia informed its Asian and U.S. customers over the weekend it would cut supplies next month, following OPEC\\'s pledge to implement its first formal output cut since 2004.  \"This sends a message that Saudi Arabia is serious about this effort to buoy the market,\" said Tim Evans, analyst at Citigroup Global Markets in New York. \"The market is flying in the face of that. Whether it is wise to taunt OPEC in this fashion remains to be seen.\" OPEC on Friday agreed to remove a total of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil from oversupplied markets. But OPEC ministers\\' lack of unity on how to implement the cuts before the hastily arranged talks has left uncertainty in traders\\' minds on how the group will implement the curbs. Some analysts said relatively high prices -- still three times the level in January 2002 -- meant there was less pressure on OPEC members to play a team game. \"The market is challenging OPEC,\" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading. \"The feeling is that OPEC could start cheating before the cuts even take effect. This is a question of OPEC\\'s credibility.\" The OPEC cut, its deepest since January 2002, has failed to halt oil\\'s slide from its July peak of $78.40 a barrel. Some analysts have expressed concern that high oil prices could damage economic growth in big consuming nations. President Bush warned the OPEC cartel that high crude oil prices could \"wreck economies\" and reduce demand for their products. \"I would hope that the OPEC nations understand that high prices of oil could wreck economies and if they wreck economies it means the purchasers will be fewer,\" Bush said in an interview with CNBC television. ANOTHER CUT POSSIBLE Some OPEC ministers said another cut of 500,000 bpd could follow when the cartel meets next in Nigeria in December. They said they were concerned about high fuel stocks in consumer countries and a projected drop in demand for OPEC oil in 2007. But OPEC President Edmund Daukoru said on Monday it was too early to decide if the cartel would have to trim production in December. \"I cannot say ahead of time whether we will cut or will not cut, just continue a process as it relates to the fundaments, and that\\'s exactly what we are going to do,\" Daukoru said. Analysts speculated that the market will soon find a bottom once the OPEC cuts begin affecting global stock levels. \"The current stock levels are on the high side but it only takes half of the promised OPEC cuts to make the worst behind us and this will gradually leave the market more exposed to supply disruption or lower production performance from non-OPEC,\" said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix. The majority of NYMEX crude speculators last week took the position that prices would fall further, the first time since March, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

A second includes Thomas H. Lee Partners and Texas Pacific Group, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The Carlyle Group also has eyed Tribune, but it is unclear whether it will participate on its own or jump into a different bidding camp, the newspaper said. Tribune is trying to sell itself amid weak financial results, an uncertain future and a divided board of directors. Last week, the company lower-than-expected third-quarter revenue, joining other newspaper publishers in reporting weak advertising sales. Chicago-based Tribune has been under pressure as its largest shareholder, the Chandler Trusts, has urged the company to consider selling itself or jettisoning divisions to boost value. Tribune has said it was considering its strategic options, which analysts say include going private, finding a buyer or selling properties ranging from the L.A. Times to the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The company has asked that bidders submit nonbinding indications of interest by the end of the month, the Wall Street Journal said. Texas Pacific Group and Tribune declined to comment. Madison Dearborn, Providence, Apollo, Carlyle and Thomas H. Lee could not be immediately reached for comment. Shares of Tribune gained 81 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $33.12 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. regulators denied approval of an antibiotic from Forest Laboratories Inc. ( FRX.N ) and Replidyne Inc. RDYN.O and recommended further clinical studies, the companies said on Monday, sending their shares down sharply. \\n\\n Replidyne lost half its market value. Larger Forest fell as much as 6.3 percent, dragging back a stock that has still run up 25 percent since a U.S. court upheld a key patent for its Lexapro anti-depressant in July. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a nonapprovable letter for faropenem medoxomil, and the companies said they expected they would need a minimum of two years to complete additional clinical studies. \"We believe this to be a major setback for Forest Labs as it was their only near-term pipeline opportunity,\" Bank of America analyst David Maris wrote in a research note. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Angela Larson said she expected Forest to still pursue faropenem and that the product\\'s sales could exceed $200 million annually. However, she does not include the drug in her financial forecasts because of its uncertain regulatory prospects. \"This is one of several items they have in development, but by no means was it the linchpin to our outlook,\" Larson said. Replidyne\\'s December application for faropenem sought approval for the drug for four conditions: acute bacterial sinusitis, community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections. New York-based Forest and Louisville, Colorado-based Replidyne in February announced an agreement to jointly develop the drug. The application was based on results of 11 late-stage clinical trials for these uses, the companies said. The FDA has recommended further clinical studies for all the potential uses, Replidyne and Forest said. The companies said they would discuss their agreement in light of the FDA decision. \"It is our intention to work together with Replidyne to conduct the additional clinical trials required to obtain FDA approval for at least two respiratory indications in order to launch faropenem,\" Forest Chief Executive Howard Solomon said in a statement. Last week, Forest posted an 18 percent rise in quarterly profit and raised its financial forecasts for the fiscal year ending in March. As reasons for optimism, Susquehanna\\'s Larson pointed to Lexapro, as well as Forest\\'s Namenda treatment for Alzheimer\\'s disease and its Benicar hypertension drug. \"I\\'m very comfortable with the valuation and that people should even be buying into this weakness given the consistency of just those three existing product lines,\" Larson said. While calling the FDA ruling an \"unfortunate regulatory outcome,\" Prudential analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note that the setback \"shouldn\\'t have a huge earnings impact on Forest for the next two or so years.\" Forest shares fell $3.07, or 6 percent, at $48.40 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade, where they earlier dropped to $48.21. Shares of Replidyne were down $4.81, or 47 percent, at $5.43 on Nasdaq after dropping to $4.80, their lowest price since the company went public in June.',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) on Monday posted a better-than-expected rise in third-quarter profit, helped by strong growth in its wireless venture Cingular and merger-related cost savings. \\n\\n The biggest U.S. telecoms carrier, formed through SBC Communications Inc.\\'s acquisition of AT&T Corp. last November, said profit, excluding merger-related costs and other special items, rose 58.2 percent from a year earlier to $2.4 billion, or 63 cents per share. That topped the average forecast of 58 cents per share from analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Despite the higher-than-expected results, AT&T\\'s shares rose only modestly on the New York Stock Exchange as investors had already pushed up the stock by 2 percent last Friday, when Cingular reported strong results. AT&T also said cost savings helped profit growth, and the company had cut 3,600 jobs in the third quarter, reaching a head count reduction of 10,500 so far this year. While that vindicated the company\\'s merger strategy, some analysts said it also suggested that AT&T\\'s core business was not growing as strongly as the bottom line suggested. \"The numbers were slightly better than expected. Certainly the Cingular numbers were good. But cost-cutting was a major factor,\" said Surterre Research analyst Todd Rethemeier, who has a \"hold\" rating on the stock. The company said primary consumer lines fell by 242,000 in the third quarter, and analysts said consumers were continuing to shift to wireless phones and all-in-one packages of voice, video and Internet offered by cable television providers. \"Looking at the line losses, it seems there is some competitive impact from cable companies,\" Rethemeier said. WIRELESS GROWTH AT&T is preparing to merge with BellSouth Corp. BLS.N, a move that would consolidate its ownership of Cingular and reinforce its position as the biggest U.S. telecoms service provider. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has scheduled a November 3 meeting to vote on the merger. \"Wireless delivered impressive margin expansion along with strong subscriber and revenue growth,\" said AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Whitacre. Analysts also expect Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) to post strong quarterly results since its wireless venture, along with Cingular, appears to be taking market share from Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S.N ). AT&T\\'s consolidated revenue, which does not include sales from its 60 percent stake in Cingular, totaled $15.6 billion for the quarter ended September 30, up from a pre-merger $10.3 billion in the third quarter of 2005. Net income was $2.2 billion, up 73.8 percent from the year-ago quarter, or 56 cents per share. That included costs from SBC Communications\\' acquisition of AT&T Corp. and from Cingular Wireless\\' purchase of AT&T Wireless. The company said Internet subscriptions also helped to bolster sales. High-speed Internet subscribers increased 25.5 percent from a year earlier to 8.2 million. AT&T is also aiming to compete with cable companies by expanding its high-definition video service in a plan called Project Lightspeed. The Internet-based video service will be expanded to around 15 cities by the end of the year. It had previously targeted 15 to 20 cities by the end of 2006. The $5 billion investment, while smaller than a similar project by Verizon, has raised concerns about costs. \"We continue to have concerns about a looming capital expenditure increase commitment to the business, if Project Lightspeed proves incapable of providing a competitive consumer video offering on a wide scale across AT&T\\'s footprint,\" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher King, who recommends selling AT&T stock. AT&T shares fell briefly in early trading before recovering to rise 29 cents, or 0.87 percent, to $34.73 on the New York Stock Exchange late Monday afternoon. The shares have risen around 40 percent so far this year.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N \\n\\n on Monday gave a disappointing outlook for the fourth quarter as sales of its chips for high-end cell phones were worse than expected going into the holiday shopping season. The world\\'s biggest maker of chips for cell phones forecast fourth-quarter revenue at $3.46 billion to $3.75 billion, which was below average Wall Street estimates and also less than the third quarter\\'s $3.76 billion. Analysts on average had forecast revenue in the fourth quarter at $3.8 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The busiest period for wireless-chip makers typically straddles a stretch between the third and fourth quarters. TI\\'s third-quarter sales had also missed market estimates, though profit from continuing operations was in line. \"No one thing stood out as the main culprit but when you add it all together it\\'s a little bit of a disappointment,\" said American Technology Research analyst Doug Freedman. TI shares fell as much as 3 percent in after-hour trading on the news before recovering to trade at $31.50, still down from their New York Stock Exchange close of $31.88. The shares had gained 51 cents, or 1.6 percent, in Monday\\'s session. The company, which makes everything from calculators to chips for flat-screen televisions, said third-quarter revenue rose to $3.76 billion from $3.59 billion. The average forecast from analysts polled by Reuters Estimates was $3.796 billion. \"People were expecting more high-end cell phones than were sold when actually they sold more low-end phones than expected,\" TI Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said in an interview. TI\\'s biggest customer -- Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), the No. 1 cell phone maker -- said last week that its average selling price for phones fell in the quarter as demand was strong for cheaper phones. Another client, Motorola Inc MOT.N, also posted disappointing growth, citing weak demand for advanced phones. March said demand for phones with fast Web links was weaker than expected in Europe. He also cited inventory corrections for high-speed phones in Japan for weaker-than-expected revenue recorded in the third quarter and expected in the fourth quarter. TI said its profit from continuing operations was $686 million, or 45 cents a share in the third quarter, up from $596 million or 36 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter and in line with analyst expectations. The company forecast fourth-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations at 40 cents to 46 cents. Average analyst expectations were 45 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Executives said on a conference call that the weaker-than-seasonal demand in its wireless business observed in the third quarter would be even more noticeable in the fourth quarter, which usually tends to see about 10 percent growth over the third quarter. March said lower-than-expected demand for more expensive phones was also a factor in its fourth-quarter outlook. \"In the fourth quarter the mix of low-end versus high-end will be more skewed to the low-end,\" the CFO said. March said he views the slack demand for high-speed phones as a pause rather than a sign of a longer-term problem. He said the company\\'s third-quarter book-to-bill ratio was 0.93 compared with 1.07 in the second quarter. This means that for every $100 of products shipped, $93 of new orders were booked. It was the first time in about five quarters that the company reported a ratio below 1.',\n",
       "  ' MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Bombardier Inc. ( BBDb.TO ) could decide by yearend to revive its dormant plan to build a new 110- to 130-passenger jet, an analyst said on Monday. \\n\\n Jacques Kavafian, analyst at Research Capital, said Bombardier may launch the $2 billion CSeries program for the  110- to 130-seater in conjunction with its proposed $300 million plan for a 98-seat stretch version of its 86-seat  CRJ900. Kavafian said he agreed with Bombardier\\'s view that there is a global market over 20 years for some 5,000 aircraft seating 100 to 135 passengers. Many of the aircraft built in the past to serve the lower end of the range, 100 to 120 seats, are not economical, and the world\\'s leading jet makers, Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) and Airbus ( EAD.PA ) have not been successful in filling the gap, he said. \"The market that the CSeries targets exists, and no other airframe manufacturer has ventured into the category so far,\" Kavafian wrote in a research report. Bombardier halted the CSeries project in late January, saying it could not find enough customers to launch the development program. The company, which is the world\\'s third-largest civil aircraft maker and the No. 1 maker of trains, has said the program is simply on hold, not abandoned, and that it ultimately could decide to go ahead with it. Kavafian cautioned that Boeing could aim at the CSeries potential market after discontinuing its 717 jet earlier this year. There has been speculation that Bombardier\\'s Brazilian rival, Embraer SA ( EMBR3.SA ), is looking at an E200 Series that would target the same category. Kavafian said Bombardier could go ahead with the CSeries without locking in a major airline as launch customer. \"Given that it would take five years to bring the aircraft to market, there is ample time for the company to find customers during the five-year development and construction phase,\" he wrote. Without a new family of jets, Bombardier\\'s commercial aircraft business could dwindle, despite a robust market for business jets, Kavafian warned. Bombardier recently announced two big orders for its regional jets, but analysts have said the company needs to land more in the weeks ahead to avoid cutting back production. Bombardier\\'s class B shares were off 4 Canadian cents, or 1 percent, at C$3.82 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at midday on Monday. Fitch Ratings said on Monday it may cut its ratings on Bombardier, mainly because it is concerned that the company is becoming less focused on reducing its debt.

The offer price is at an 18.9 percent premium to the average price of Techem\\'s shares over the past 3 months, and 4 percent above its Friday closing price. Macquarie also said it would seek support from Techem management for its offer and was interested in working with the current management in future. \"This is an attractive offer that we believe is in the best interests of shareholders and the company,\" Martin Stanley, executive director of Macquarie Bank, said in a statement. Stanley, who is responsible for the bank\\'s European Infrastructure Funds, said: \"Macquarie is offering shareholders the opportunity to achieve a full, cash price -- or retain a low-yielding investment.\" Techem provides energy and water metering services for some 7.4 million households in Europe. The bank also said it would retain the Techem brand and its location, adding that it had no plans to restructure Techem further. Macquarie\\'s offer comes after Techem said last week it would reject a possible approach by financial investors in case of any offer.',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp. ( JBLU.O ) on Tuesday posted a narrow third-quarter loss, the latest sign that short-haul carriers face softening demand, but shares rose after the discount airline said it will pare expansion plans. \\n\\n JetBlue, which is in the midst of a restructuring plan to trim $120 million from annual expenses by 2007, said it will slow its growth rate over the next three years by reducing its 190-strong fleet of Airbus A320 and Embraer ( ERJ.N ) planes. Shares rose nearly 7 percent in early trading. \"We feel very strongly that the slower growth will be a benefit to our investors,\" said Chief Executive David Neeleman on a conference call. Neeleman said JetBlue has no plans to raise capital in stock offerings for the next three years, soothing investor concerns that the fast-growing airline could dilute earnings by issuing new shares to finance expansion. The company said it may take delivery of the 30 planes it has on order for next year and sell or lease older ones. But it didn\\'t specify how many planes or what types would be cut. With the revised growth plans, JetBlue said it expects capacity to increase 14 percent to 17 percent in 2007. It previously planned to expand capacity 18 percent to 20 percent. Six-year-old JetBlue, which is in the midst of a restructuring program, posted a net loss of $500,000, or nil per share, compared with a net profit of $2.7 million, or 2 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts expected the company to break even, according to Reuters Estimates. Earnings were boosted by a $7 million pretax gain from the sale of five A320 aircraft earlier this year, as part of an earlier plan dampen growth that also included the deferral of 12 A320s that were to be delivered in 2007. DISCOUNTERS FACE HEADWINDS While the overall airline industry experiences a rebound from a six-year slump, discount carriers such as JetBlue are facing headwinds. Traditional airlines like United Airlines UAUA.O have made deep cost cuts to compete more effectively with low-cost carriers. Meanwhile, demand for short-haul routes operated by budget airlines took a hit from tighter security measures implemented August 10 after British police said they uncovered a plot to blow up airliners. \"It appears low-cost carriers are in a vice with high fuel and the increased hassle factor (associated with tighter security measures),\" said Ray Neidl, an analyst with Calyon Securities. JetBlue said operating revenue rose 39 percent to $628 million as the company added flights and raised ticket prices at the expense of filling seats. JetBlue\\'s load factor, the percentage of airline seats filled with paying customers, fell 6.2 points to 80.4 percent. The company is trying to improve earnings by charging higher average fares even if it means empty seats. CEO Neeleman also said that the New York-based carrier is in talks with international airlines about codeshare partnerships and could announce a deal in the course of the next quarter. For the fourth quarter, JetBlue said it expects to report an operating margin between 6 percent and 8 percent, assuming fuel cost of $1.94 per gallon. Jet fuel is currently trading at about $1.69 per gallon. The company has hedges in place above this level, which may lead to it paying above-market prices for fuel. JetBlue shares were up 44 cents at $11.58 in midday trading on Nasdaq. JetBlue has underperformed the sector so far this year, falling 28 percent, while the Amex airline index  .XAL  rose 22 percent.

Losing bidders, AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy's Finmeccanica SpA ( SIFI.MI ), which had joined forces with L-3 Communications Holdings ( LLL.N ), and MD Helicopters Inc., a small private company, protested the decision to the GAO. Textron Inc.'s ( TXT.N ) Bell Helicopter unit had also bid for the contract. EADS teamed with Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp.

Army spokeswoman Kim Henry said the Light Utility Helicopter project office would now execute the contract previously signed with EADS. EADS had no further comment. The Army contract was the first major U.S. defense contract won by the North American unit of EADS. Analysts say the Army deal could also help EADS win more commercial and government orders for its twin-engine UH-145 rotary wing aircraft. The new helicopters, based on Eurocopter's EC145, will replace hundreds of the Army's Vietnam-era UH-1s and Kiowas, and will also be used for homeland defense, humanitarian and other noncombat missions.\",\n",

The Lockheed and Northrop earnings came after rival General Dynamics Corp. ( GD.N ) reported rising profit last week. No. 2 defense contractor Boeing Co.

But Northrop, the No. 3 contractor, cut its full-year forecast due to a legal charge for a proposed settlement over microelectronics parts made by a company it acquired four years ago. Lockheed shares rose slightly, briefly hitting an all-time high, while Northrop shares dipped.

The Bethesda, Maryland-based company said profit increased to $629 million, or $1.46 per share, from $427 million, or 96 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 4 percent to $9.61 billion. Profit easily beat Wall Street\\'s expectation of $1.24 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue was below analysts\\' average estimate of $9.8 billion. Lockheed posted higher sales at its systems and information technology unit and at its space systems unit. Sales at its aeronautics unit fell. It benefited in the quarter from a one-time land sale, which increased profit by 5 cents per share, and a one-time tax gain related to export tax benefits claimed for previous years, which increased profit by 14 cents per share. Citing operational improvements and the benefit of one-time gains, Lockheed raised its full-year profit forecast to a range of $5.45 to $5.60 per share. Analysts expected $5.29 per share, on average. For 2007, Lockheed forecast profit in the range of $5.60 to $5.80 per share. Analysts expected $5.65 per share, on average. NORTHROP TAKES BIG CHARGE Northrop, which makes warships, nuclear submarines, unmanned surveillance planes and a range of military electronics, said third-quarter profit rose 3 percent on higher sales at most of its units, offset by a large legal charge. The Los Angeles-based company cut its full-year profit forecast to account for the charge. It reported net profit increased to $302 million, or 86 cents per share, from $293 million, or 81 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 2 percent to $7.4 billion. Earnings from continuing operations were 87 cents per share, below Wall Street\\'s average expectation of $1.07 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts expected revenue of $7.8 billion. Northrop took a charge of $112.5 million before taxes to cover potential claims by the U.S. Justice Department and an unnamed customer over microelectronics parts produced by a unit of TRW Inc., a company that Northrop acquired in 2002. Northrop has made a settlement offer to the customer, but no agreement has yet been reached. The company has not given any details on the content of the legal action. It now sees profit of $4.20 to $4.25 per share for the full year, down from its previous forecast of $4.35 to $4.45. Analysts expected $4.47 per share, on average. Lockheed shares were trading up 85 cents, or nearly 1 percent, to $89.04 by late morning on the New York Stock Exchange, after briefly setting an all-time high of $89.17 in early trade.

       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) on Monday posted a quarterly loss of $5.8 billion -- its largest loss in 14 years -- as slower truck sales, charges for job cuts and asset write-downs in its troubled North American operations and elsewhere took their toll on the No. 2 U.S. automaker. \\n\\n Ford said it would restate results from 2001 through the second quarter and cautioned that operating results would weaken further in the current quarter. Ford also said it was considering raising new funding secured by its automotive assets in order to protect its cash position as it pays the bill to close 16 plants and cut up to 45,000 jobs. \"These business results are clearly unacceptable,\" said Chief Executive Alan Mulally, who took over at Ford in early September. Ford posted a net loss of $3.08 per share for the third quarter compared with a loss of $284 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. That included a battery of charges that totaled $4.6 billion after taxes, or $2.46 per share. Ford\\'s loss from continuing operations was 62 cents per share, matching analysts\\' average forecast as tracked by Reuters Estimates. Analysts have urged Mulally to consider further asset sales to protect Ford\\'s cash position, and in his first post-earnings conference call with analysts some credited him with a more open approach to the company\\'s turnaround. \"One of the things that\\'s positive about Mulally coming in is that nothing is sacred and he is willing to take a fresh look,\" said Morningstar analyst John Novak. Said Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan: \"Simply shrinking again is not necessarily the answer. Ford needs to become a company flexible enough to be profitable at lower production volumes on each line (and) on each platform.\" REVENUE DOWN, CASH IN FOCUS Revenue for the quarter was $36.7 billion, down $4.1 billion. Auto sales accounted for $32.6 billion of total revenue. High gasoline prices have caused U.S. consumers to shift away from sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, a segment that represents over 60 percent of Ford\\'s current sales. Ford ended the quarter with cash of $23.6 billion but said that total would drop near $20 billion by the end of the year as it restructures. Fitch Ratings, which placed Ford\\'s debt on watch for a downgrade on Monday, said the automaker needed to hold at least $15 billion in consolidated cash in order to avoid raising concern among suppliers and customers. Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair said Ford was \"exploring various financing strategies, including secured financing involving a substantial portion\" of its automotive operations. Ford is selling its British luxury brand Aston Martin. Leclair said the company is in the process of preparing a short list of bidders but does not expect to close a sale this year. Mulally also said Ford is open to reviewing its other luxury brands -- leaving the door open to a potential sale of Jaguar, Volvo or Land Rover. \"I really think it\\'s going to hinge on how the businesses are doing and can we make profitable growth businesses out of them with the action we have taken and additional actions that might be required,\" he said. BUYOUTS ON THE TABLE Ford is offering buyouts to all of its 75,000 unionized workers in a bid to reduce its factory work force by nearly half. The bulk of hourly workers taking buyouts to leave the company in the first and second quarter of 2007. About 4,000 employees at former Visteon Corp.( VC.N ) factories, now grouped under Automotive Component Holdings, have already accepted buyouts, the company said. In the third quarter, Ford took pretax charges of $861 million for job cuts related to plant closings in North America, $259 million for job cuts elsewhere, and $437 million to pay out pensions earlier than planned . Ford also took pretax charges of $2.2 billion to write down the value of North American assets and $1.6 billion for the impairment of Jaguar and Land Rover assets. Ford Motor Credit\\'s net profit fell to $262 million from $577 million a year earlier in part because of higher financing costs driven by the parent company\\'s junk credit rating. \"The reduced profitability at Ford Motor Credit now shines a more intense light on the weakness of Ford\\'s fundamental operation -- the automotive business,\" Tynan said. Ford executives repeated that the company has no plans to sell its finance arm, although Leclair said the automaker would be open to partnerships in some markets. Shares of Ford were down 14 cents or 1.8 percent to $7.87 in early afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Jui Chakravorty  and  Kevin Krolicki  )',\n",
       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Shares of Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) posted their biggest gain in two months on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs removed its \"sell\" rating from the struggling automaker, saying the potential payoff from its restructuring would outweigh its weak outlook. \\n\\n Ford shares were up 4.8 percent to $8.28 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest one-day percentage gain since late August when the stock was rallying on expectations of a more aggressive turnaround plan by the automaker. \"We think the focus will remain weighted to restructuring upside,\" Robert Barry of Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients, after he upgraded Ford shares on Tuesday to \"neutral\" from \"sell.\" \"Nearer-term fundamental weakness will likely be discounted in favor of potential for future improvements,\" Barry said. Ford\\'s revised \"Way Forward\" restructuring announced in mid-September disappointed Wall Street and touched off a sharp sell-off in its shares by steering clear of asset sales and failing to address the company\\'s liquidity position. But newly appointed Chief Executive Alan Mulally, who spoke to analysts after Monday\\'s announcement of a $5.8 billion quarterly loss, did not rule out a future sale of luxury brands such as Jaguar. Investor reaction to the quarterly loss was muted. Ford shares closed down just over 1 percent on Monday. Credit default swaps on Ford also tightened on the results, as the debt market reacted to Ford\\'s plan to shore up its cash position with new secured borrowing. A key factor in the more cautiously optimistic outlook is Mulally, a former Boeing Co. executive credited with turning around the aircraft maker\\'s commercial plane division. Mulally was named CEO on September 5, ending Ford family scion Bill Ford Jr.\\'s troubled five-year stint at the top. Peter Jacobs, analyst with Ragen MacKenzie, said Mulally appeared committed to improving the company\\'s cost structure and profitability. \"We remain comfortable with the company\\'s turnaround prospects and believe the convertible preferred securities offer an attractive way to participate in the expected...recovery over the next couple of years,\" Jacobs said in a note. Jacobs\\' 24-month target on the convertible preferred securities -- exchangeable for common stock at a later date -- is $48 per share, which equates to about $12 to $13 per common share, he said. WORSE BEFORE GETTING BETTER? Rival General Motors Corp.( GM.N ), which is undergoing its own sweeping restructuring, has seen its star rise on Wall Street this year as optimism on its own turnaround mounted. GM shares, which fell by 50 percent in 2005 and hit a multiyear low of $18.40 in late December, bounced back to post a gain of about 80 percent year to date. But Burnham Securities analyst Dave Healy, who does not see an upside in Ford shares any time soon, said GM was ahead of Ford, particularly on the product front. Healy, who three months ago bought GM shares but owns no Ford stock, said Ford was at least four years behind GM in its restructuring. \"The key difference between the two companies\\' turnaround is that Ford, as far as product is concerned. is starting now,\" Healy said. Seven of 15 analysts have a \"sell\" or \"underperform\" rating on Ford while nine have a \"hold\" on the shares, according to Reuters Estimates. Ford plans to close 16 plants, slash nearly 45,000 jobs and is offering buyouts to about 75,000 of its union workers as part of its restructuring. The company does not expect its North American unit to be profitable until 2009. Ford also cautioned on Monday that operating results would weaken in the current quarter and cash flow would remain negative in the coming few years. \"We believe Ford remains on track to to burn through $7 billion to $8 billion in cash in 2006,\" said Calyon Securities analyst Joseph Amaturo, who has a \"sell\" rating and a $5 target on Ford stock. \"We continue to believe Ford is financially the weakest of the Big Three.\"',\n",
       "  ' STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Truck maker Volvo posted a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly pretax profit on Tuesday and said key markets would be at the top end of its forecasts this year, though North America would weaken in 2007. \\n\\n The Sweden-based firm, the world\\'s No. 2 truck maker, said third-quarter pretax earnings fell to 3.14 billion crowns ($428 million) from 4.02 billion a year ago, but topped the mean forecast of 2.96 billion in a Reuters poll of 17 analysts. Earnings were hit by a 1.7 billion crown writedown of goodwill, which was included in analysts\\' estimates. Revenues at the firm, which sells trucks, buses, construction equipment and a broad range of engines, rose to 57.43 billion crowns from 52.25 billion a year ago, above the mean forecast of 56.58 billion in the poll. Truck markets on both sides of the Atlantic are seen peaking this year, with demand supercharged by customers accelerating purchases of older, but cheaper, trucks ahead of stricter environmental rules implemented in Europe this month and set to come into effect in the United States at the turn of the year. Analysts predict a slide in truck sales next year as the spending spree tails off, especially in North America. Volvo confirmed this picture. \"We are anticipating that the decline could be as much as 40 percent during the first half of the year,\" the firm said. Chief Executive Leif Johansson told a news conference this was a \"worst-case scenario\", though a planned cut in production capacity would hit both temporary and full-time employees. \"I think some will feel that this 40-percent decline is a bit negative,\" an analyst said. \"Market estimates have ranged from a drop of 20 to 40 percent for the full year.\" Johansson said he expected the North American market to come back during the second half of next year and that the firm was prepared to raise production capacity again if needed. TRUCK ORDERS HIT The firm said order intake for its trucks, sold under the Volvo, Renault and Mack brands, fell 22 percent year-on-year in the quarter, mainly due to a 58-percent plunge in North America. Volvo said the European heavy truck market, where pre-buying has been less pronounced, would be largely in line with 2006. \"...we expect the European market to be stable or slightly stronger than last year\\'s relevant market,\" Johansson said. The firm saw total industry sales at the top end of its forecasts this year, at around 290,000 units in Europe and around 340,000 units in North America. Shares in Volvo opened slightly higher and were up 0.1 percent at 451 crowns by 0930 GMT, outperforming the DJ Stoxx auto index which was down 0.5 percent. Volvo trades at 11.9 times estimated 2006 earnings compared with 16.3 for rival DaimlerChrysler, which also makes cars. \"After Scania\\'s numbers, which came in so strong, the market has had high expectations of Volvo\", said analyst Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. \"We don\\'t see their (U.S.) outlook as something that will change estimates.\" Volvo management has come under pressure to return more of its hefty cash pile to shareholders after activist fund Cevian and Parvus Asset Management built up a 5.3 percent stake, to become the second-biggest owner of voting rights after Renault\\'s 20 percent. The truck maker has responded by setting more demanding financial targets, but has said it would only decide on raised shareholder returns after possible acquisitions. As consolidation in the industry has accelerated, evident not least in German MAN\\'s bid for smaller Swedish rival Scania, Volvo has started to expand in Asia. It last month agreed to boost its holding in Japan\\'s Nissan Diesel Motor Co. to 46.5 percent. Indian media have reported it is eyeing a stake in Ashok Leyland Ltd..

       "  ' HOUSTON  (Reuters) - DuPont Co. ( DD.N ), the No. 2 U.S. chemicals maker, on Tuesday posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit against a year-earlier loss, helped by rising sales and higher prices, especially in its paints business. \\n\\n The company, whose shares reached a 16-month high in early trading on Tuesday, also said it will deliver higher year-over-year earnings in the fourth quarter and expects to meet its long-term target of 10 percent annual growth in earnings per share. But the company stuck to its full-year profit forecast at $2.85 per share excluding one-time items, which fell short of some analysts\\' expectations. \"We had to take into account slower U.S. housing and slower U.S. autos (demand),\" DuPont Chairman and Chief Executive Charles Holliday Jr. said during a conference call. Analysts welcomed the earnings figures, but were surprised by the outlook. \"While this was disappointing, we believe it is also conservative given the strong momentum exhibited in pricing, volumes and fixed costs productivity in the quarter,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a research note. \"The guidance that they have given is pretty hedged and they have a pretty good sense of how the quarter has already shaped up.\" said Hassan Ahmed, analyst and senior vice president with HSBC Securities. Net income for the third-quarter was $485 million or 52 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $82 million, or 9 cents a share, in the year ago period. Excluding a benefit from insurance and other items, the company earned 49 cents per share in the most recent quarter. On average, analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had forecast earnings of 44 cents a share. MOMENTUM \\'WILL CONTINUE\\' \"Our momentum will continue into 2007 and we expect to meet our long-term financial goal of 10 percent annual growth in earnings per share,\" CEO Holliday said in a statement. Net sales rose 7 percent in the period to $6.3 billion, beating the Wall Street estimate by about $200 million, with double-digit increases in Asia Pacific and Europe. The chemicals company said local selling prices were higher in every region, increasing worldwide sales 3 percent. Overall sales volume increased 3 percent, reflecting higher sales of titanium dioxide, engineering and packaging polymers, industrial chemicals and electronic materials. Sales in the coatings and color technologies unit rose 8 percent, while pretax profit rose more than 10-fold to $276 million versus the year-ago quarter, which was hurt by charges related to damage from hurricanes. HSBC\\'s Ahmed said the coatings and color technologies unit benefited from smooth titanium dioxide production and increased prices for the specialty chemical. The restructuring of operations, particularly in Europe, is also clearly helping, he added. In the year-ago period the hurricane season adversely impacted the coatings division and forced a reduction in its titanium dioxide output, one of the main contributors to earnings for this division. The increases in sales volume and prices helped DuPont offset higher raw material costs, as did a reduction in its fixed costs of 7 cents per share versus a year ago. DuPont, which has suffered because of rising energy prices, told analysts that higher raw materials prices added $180 million to its costs during the quarter, but the company expected that increase to be smaller in the current period. It said Tuesday that it expects to complete its $1.7 billion share buyback by the end of 2007. Shares rose 1.2 percent, or 55 cents, to $46.00 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after rising as much as 3.2 percent earlier in the session. Shares of DuPont, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, have risen more than 16 percent in the last 3 months, outperforming the Standard and Poor\\'s Chemicals index .GSPPM which is up about 11 percent during the same period.

CMVT.O, accused of fraud in an alleged stock options scheme, is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday, a court official said on Monday, \\n\\n David Kreinberg, who left Comverse in May, is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn before Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis to enter a guilty plea, a clerk for the judge said. Kreinberg\\'s lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. Prosecutors charge that Kreinberg, Comverse\\'s former general counsel, William Sorin, and the company\\'s former chief executive, Jacob \"Kobi\" Alexander, engaged in an options scheme that allowed them to reap millions of dollars in profits by altering the grant dates of stock option awards. According to court documents filed in July, Kreinberg personally profited $1 million by exercising stock options that had been wrongly backdated. In backdating, stock option award grant dates are manipulated in a such a way that locks in a risk-free profit for the recipient. In a typical scheme, option grant dates are changed to days when a company\\'s stock hits a low price. Alexander and Kreinberg are also accused of creating fake names to generate hundreds of thousands of backdated options that were parked in a slush fund meant to evade the company\\'s restrictions on options, the court documents show. Kreinberg and Sorin had both been in plea talks with the government. The two men surrendered in New York in August, when both were released on a $1 million bond. After an international manhunt, Alexander was arrested and detained in Namibia. He was released on bail by a magistrate judge there and remains free as the Namibian government mulls a recent extradition request from the United States. Kreinberg\\'s guilty plea would be the first in a wide-ranging investigation of past stock options practices by U.S. prosecutors on both coasts. So far, the government has only arrested and charged executives from New York-based Comverse and Brocade Communications Systems Inc. ( BRCD.O ), but others are under scrutiny for possible criminal behavior and more than two dozen executives have resigned due to the probes.',\n",

Garaufis in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. He told the judge that he assisted the company\\'s former chief executive, Jacob \"Kobi\" Alexander, with backdating options and concealing the practice from the company\\'s board of directors and accountants. Prosecutors charged that Kreinberg, Alexander and Comverse former general counsel William Sorin engaged in an options scheme that allowed them to reap millions of dollars in profits by altering the grant dates of stock option awards. Overall, more than two dozen U.S. executives have resigned in the storm over stock options and at least 125 companies have mounted internal investigations or are being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission to see if they wrongfully manipulated the dates of stock options they granted. The Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service are also looking into possible wrongdoing. Kreinberg has signed a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors. The charges he faces carry a penalty of 15 years in prison and the government is estimating restitution of $51 million. His sentencing was set for February 23. Separately, the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in Brooklyn said that the SEC had settled its civil case against Kreinberg.

       "  \" WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve policy-makers started a two-day meeting on Tuesday that was widely expected to conclude with a decision to hold interest rates steady along with a renewed warning on the risk of inflation. \\n\\n The Federal Open Market Committee began meeting at about 2 p.m. (1600 GMT), a Fed official said. The U.S. central bank is expected to announce its decision around 2:15 p.m. (1815) on Wednesday. After a more than two-year long campaign of interest rate increases, the Fed moved to the sidelines in August and again held overnight rates steady at 5.25 percent in September. However, officials have kept the possibility of more rate hikes on the table as they continued to warn of the risk inflation could stay unacceptably high. A month ago, financial markets had been thinking a housing-led slowdown in U.S. economic growth could lead to a series of rate reductions beginning early next year. Recently, however, markets have begun to price in some chance that the Fed might raise credit costs again to deal with persistent price pressures. Interest rate futures markets on Tuesday showed investors fully convinced the Fed will leave rates steady this week. Still, they implied an 8 percent chance of a rate hike in December and an 18 percent chance of a rise in January. A month ago, they had priced in as many as three quarter-percentage point rate cuts during 2007. A Reuters poll of 21 big U.S. bond trading firms last week found seven predicting higher rates ahead, while 14 were looking for the Fed's next move to be a cut.\",\n",
       "  \" LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil producer BP Plc's ( BP.L ) third-quarter replacement cost net profit rose 58 percent to $6.975 billion thanks to asset sales but still undershot analysts' forecasts as production and refining margins fell. \\n\\n BP said in a statement that it was setting aside another $400 million to cover compensation claims related to a fatal blast at its Texas City refinery last year, pushing the total bill, including repairs and lost profits to around $2 billion. The world's second-largest fully-quoted oil company by market capitalization also ditched its 2006 oil and gas production target, saying it would produce only 3.95 million barrels of oil equivalent (boepd) per day this year compared to an original target of 4.1-4.2 million boepd. Jason Kenney, oil analyst at ING, said this was expected. This is partly due to asset sales but also reflects problems at Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, where pipeline corrosion led to cuts in output, and delays in bringing key projects, such as the Thunder Horse platform in the Gulf of Mexico, onstream. BP's shares traded up 0.25 percent at 603 pence at 0855 GMT on Tuesday, compared to a 0.1 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European oil and gas sector index .SXEP. BP's headline replacement cost result -- which strips out gains or losses due to changes in the value of inventories -- of $6.975 billion was flattered by $2.47 billion in one-off items such as asset sales and deferred taxes, a BP spokesman said. Stripping out these gains, third quarter profit was $4.50 billion, compared to a Reuters poll of 10 analysts which gave an average forecast of $4.696 billion. BP reported $1.225 billion in one-offs but this excluded an $892 million profit related to BP's share of a gain by its Russian joint venture TNK-BP on the sale of a production unit and another $354 million in tax and accounting related gains not related to BP's actual performance in the quarter. EARNINGS PEAKED? Analysts said the confusion over the non-operating items made it hard to compare the results with last year, when BP reported a $5.33 billion replacement cost net profit, excluding one-offs. However, it seemed that BP's profits had fallen, which would bolster some analysts' view that a three year run of oil companies posting record earnings has ended as oil prices moderate. Average oil prices were at a record high in the third quarter but it appears this was not sufficient to compensate for soaring oil field costs, higher taxes, a fall in refining margins and lower production. Most analysts polled by Reuters last week also forecast a fall in profits at Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) which reports its third quarter results on Thursday. With analysts forecasting oil prices $10 per barrel lower in the fourth quarter than in the third, BP and its rivals may be facing tougher times ahead. BP said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 9.825 cents per share compared with 8.925 cents per share a year ago. Analysts believe that BP's replacement cost profit, excluding non-operating items, is the best measure of the London-based company's underlying performance.\",\n",

       "  ' HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Former Enron Corp. chief executive Jeff Skilling was sentenced on Monday to more than 24 years in prison for leading a financial fraud that destroyed the company and came to symbolize a dark era for corporate America. \\n\\n U.S. District Judge Sim Lake, in handing out the harshest sentence yet in the Enron saga, said Skilling\\'s crimes \"have imposed on hundreds if not thousands of people a lifetime of poverty.\" He allowed Skilling, 52, to remain out of jail, but mostly confined to his home with an electronic monitor on his ankle until the U.S. Bureau of Prisons orders him to report, likely within the next 90 days. Skilling also was ordered to pay $45 million in restitution to Enron investors, who lost billions of dollars when the company collapsed. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and retirement funds. FBI assistant director Chip Burrus said in a statement Skilling\\'s punishment sent a message to white collar criminals. \"Corporate crooks should beware. If you decide to use business coffers as your personal piggy bank at the expense of investors and employees, you risk loss of personal freedom,\" he said. Judge Lake\\'s sentence of 24 years and four months was the lowest it could have been within federal guidelines for the white collar crime. Skilling, once one of corporate America\\'s brightest and brashest stars, was subdued but stoic, telling reporters he was \"disappointed\" by the verdict but would appeal the 19 criminal counts against him. \"I don\\'t blame the judge for what he did. I have a constitutional right to appeal, and I think we\\'ll win,\" he said. Skilling showed little emotion during the hearing, but occasionally looked back at wife, Rebecca, who sobbed in the gallery. On May 25, Skilling and Enron founder Ken Lay were found guilty of defrauding investors by using off-the-books deals to hide debt and inflate profits. Enron, once the country\\'s seventh largest company, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 when the deals were disclosed. The resulting scandal rocked Wall Street and prompted reforms in the way companies report their finances. Lay, 64, died of a heart attack in July while vacationing in Colorado. Following legal precedent, Judge Lake threw out the Lay convictions on October 17 because Lay died before a final judgment had been entered and before he could appeal. In comments to the court before sentencing, Skilling said he was remorseful for what happened at Enron, but maintained he had committed no crime. \"I can\\'t imagine more remorse. I had friends who died, good men,\" he said, appearing to choke up momentarily. \"All of that being said, your honor, I\\'m innocent of these charges. I\\'m innocent of every one of these charges.\" As he did in testimony during his trial, Skilling blamed the demise of Enron on a credit and liquidity crunch. \"The company did not have enough dry powder to deal with it. That, in sum and substance, is what happened in Enron,\" he said. He and Lay testified that the crisis of confidence that engulfed Enron was caused by the actions of a few rogue employees, primarily former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. Fastow confessed to skimming millions of dollars from the off-the-books deals he set up at Skilling\\'s direction. He pleaded guilty, cooperated with prosecutors and received a six-year prison sentence. Prior to sentencing, several former Enron investors and employees made \"victim impact statements\" in which most of them called for Lake to impose the maximum sentence, which would have been just over 30 years. \"The worst mistake Ken Lay ever did was to hire you,\" former employee Ann Beliveaux told Skilling. \"When things got bad, you jumped ship because you knew the sky was getting ready to fall.\" \"I had $1.3 million and all I have to show for it is two clocks (for service awards),\" said another former employee Charles Prestwood. \"People think things like that don\\'t happen in America, but it does. It happened to us,\" he said. Skilling joins other prominent executives whose corner-office careers ended in prison cells. WorldCom founder Bernard Ebbers received a 25-year sentence, former Tyco chairman Dennis Kozlowski got 8 to 25 years, and John and Timothy Rigas of Adelphia received 15 and 20 year sentences, respectively. Prosecutor Sean Berkowitz argued for a long sentence for Skilling, saying that Enron\\'s demise had wide-ranging effects. \"The integrity of the marketplace as a whole was shaken by what happened at Enron,\" he said. \"People lost their trust and their faith in the marketplace. \"Enron symbolized more than any other company the era of corporate fraud,\" Berkowitz said. But Skilling\\'s attorney Daniel Petrocelli argued for a sentence of 7 to 10 years, saying Skilling had meant no harm. \"Mr. Skilling set out to harm nobody. He didn\\'t loot the company, he didn\\'t engage in self-dealing ... he was not motivated by greed,\" he said.',\n",
       "  \" CHICAGO/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) is teaming up with Chinese bank Shenzhen Development Bank ( 000001.SZ ) to launch a credit card in China, tapping the country's $2 trillion in domestic savings. \\n\\n The co-branded card would be Wal-Mart's second in as many months, following a deal with Bank of Communications Co. ( 3328.HK ), which is 19.9-percent owned by HSBC Holdings Plc. ( 0005.HK ) ( HSBA.L ), Wal-Mart spokesman Jonathan Dong said. GE Money, the consumer finance arm of General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), will provide technical support for the card venture, which would be unveiled on Friday, a Shenzhen Development Bank spokeswoman said on Tuesday. The latest card would be offered in affluent southern China, while the Bank of Communications co-branded card is available in the northern part of the country. Both credit cards are dual-currency and can be used inside China or abroad. Wal-Mart vice chairman John Menzer mentioned the credit card deals in a presentation to analysts in New Jersey on Monday evening, listing them as among the growth opportunities for Wal-Mart's financial services business. Foreign banks are currently prohibited from independently issuing any type of bank card or setting up card joint ventures in China. HSBC and Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), two early market entrants, are seeking to become the first companies to do so. Wal-Mart, which competes with Carrefour SA ( CARR.PA ) and other global retailers in China, operates 66 stores in 34 cities across the country. Wal-Mart is planning to buy Trust-Mart, a closely held Taiwan company with 100 supercenters in China, for US$1 billion, sources said last week, which would more than double its presence in the world's most populous country. U.S. private equity firm Newbridge Capital NB.UL bought a 17.89 percent stake in Shenzhen Development Bank for 1.24 billion yuan in 2004, making the U.S. firm the first foreign controlling shareholder of a local bank. Last October, GE Consumer Finance said that it would pay US$100 million for a 7.3 percent stake in Shenzhen Bank, a deal that hasn't yet been approved by Chinese regulators.

CME.N, parent of the largest U.S. futures exchange, on Tuesday said quarterly profit jumped 34 percent on a rising tide of higher-margin trading. \\n\\n The results came a week after CME announced a proposed merger with long-time rival the Chicago Board of Trade BOT.N that is expected to create the world's largest derivatives mart. CME's third-quarter net income rose to $103.8 million, or $2.95 per share, from $77.5 million, or $2.22 a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $2.86 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net revenue, while up 22 percent to $274.7 million against $225.7 million, missed Wall Street's forecast of $282.2 million. Average daily trading volume for the quarter was previously reported at almost 5.4 million contracts, up 28 percent on the year, when the lower-priced TRAKRS products were excluded. CME said its rate per contract (RPC) for the quarter, a key measure of margins, was 64.1 cents, up from 63.2 cents in the second quarter, excluding TRAKRS. The increase reflected steadily rising use of Globex, CME's electronic platform, for interest rate options trading. Electronic options volume for the quarter was 148,000 contracts a day, nearly triple a year ago, accounting for 12 percent of total CME options volume. That helped the RPC for the interest rate segment, CME's busiest, rise almost 4 percent on the quarter. Total expenses rose 11 percent for the quarter to $117.7 million, driven by licensing, technology maintenance and compensation-related costs. Operating margins were 59 percent against 55 percent for the same quarter a year ago. CME's working capital rose by about $76 million during the quarter to more than $1.2 billion as of September 30.\",\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, on Tuesday said third-quarter profit rose 2 percent, less than analysts expected, as demand for home loans slumped. \\n\\n Shares rose 6 percent, the biggest gain in more than two years, on plans to lay off more than 2,500 employees and buy back up to $2.5 billion of stock. Higher profits in other units, including Countrywide Bank, also cushioned the mortgage decline. \"Investors expected weakness,\" said Frederick Cannon, managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. in San Francisco, who rates Countrywide \"market perform.\" \"They got a weak quarter, but not a disaster.\" The job cuts equal 4 percent of Countrywide\\'s workforce. They will help cut annual costs by more than $500 million by year end, Chief Operating Officer David Sambol said on a conference call. Headcount fell by 847 last quarter. Net income for Calabasas, California-based Countrywide rose to $647.6 million, or $1.03 per share, from $633.9 million, or $1.03, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4 percent to $2.82 billion, while expenses rose 8 percent to $1.79 billion. Analysts, on average, forecast profit of $1.08 per share on revenue of $2.96 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Pretax profit rose 33 percent to $371 million in banking, and 53 percent to $141 million in capital markets. Insurance profit totaled $91 million, reversing a loss that stemmed in part from Hurricane Katrina. These gains helped offset a 40 percent drop in mortgage banking pretax profit to $424 million. Loan production slumped 22 percent to $115.1 billion. Shares of Countrywide rose $2.12 to $37.33 on the New York Stock Exchange, their biggest percentage gain since June 7, 2004. The KBW Mortgage Finance Index .MFX rose 0.3 percent. DIVERSIFICATION Countrywide originates about one in six U.S. residential mortgages. It joined Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ) and Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ), its biggest rivals, in reporting softening mortgage demand. Washington Mutual and subprime lender Ameriquest Mortgage Co. have this year also cut several thousand jobs each. \"Countrywide\\'s investments to diversify away from mortgages are paying off just at the right time in the cycle,\" said Chris Brendler, a managing director at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, who rates Countrywide \"buy.\" On October 12, the Federal Reserve reported \"widespread cooling\" in housing, as prices and sales fall and inventories of unsold homes rise. \"We\\'ve already had the hard landing,\" Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo said on the conference call. \"You\\'re going to see increasing consolidation over 2007.... This cleansing that takes place as the markets pull back is always healthy in the long run, for both Countrywide and the industry.\" BUYBACK The share buyback covers nearly one-eighth of Countrywide\\'s stock. It includes plans to buy back $1 billion to $2 billion this quarter, financed by issuing hybrid securities yielding about 7 percent. Countrywide revised its forecast for 2006 profit to $4.10 to $4.50 per share, including the buyback\\'s impact, from $4 to $4.80. Analysts expected $4.37. \"The stability of their earnings is greater than what the market might have expected,\" said Mark Patterson, managing director at NWQ Investment Management Co. in Los Angeles, which invests $32 billion and owns Countrywide stock. Pretax loan servicing profit fell 52 percent to $123 million, despite 19 percent growth in Countrywide\\'s servicing portfolio to $1.24 trillion. The value of mortgage servicing rights, or fees that Countrywide expects by collecting payments from borrowers, fell by $173 million as lower interest rates encouraged refinancing. Mozilo last week agreed to remain chief executive through 2009, when he will turn 71.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp., the largest U.S. mortgage lender, on Tuesday said it expects to cut staff by more than 2,500 employees to help save more than $500 million as demand for home loans slumps. \\n\\n The cuts affect about 4 percent of Calabasas, California-based Countrywide\\'s CFC.N workforce. They follow thousands of job cuts announced this year by other large mortgage lenders, including Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ) and subprime lender Ameriquest Mortgage Co. On a conference call, Chief Operating Officer David Sambol said Countrywide expects to realize \"a big portion\" of its overall expense savings in the fourth quarter. The company had already reduced staffing by 847 people from July to September, ending the quarter with 55,564 employees. \"Gross layoffs will exceed 2,500 employees,\" Sambol said. The company in July announced the planned expense reductions, but didn\\'t specify the number of job losses. Countrywide on Tuesday also said third-quarter profit rose 2 percent to $647.6 million from $633.9 million last year. Profit was $1.03 per share in both periods. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates on average forecast $1.08. Better results at Countrywide Bank and in capital markets and insurance cushioned a 22 percent drop in mortgage lending. In afternoon trading, Countrywide shares rose $1.62, or 4.6 percent, to $36.83 on the New York Stock Exchange. CLEANSING Demand for mortgages has softened after 17 Federal Reserve interest-rate increases, and after home prices soared in many markets. On October 12, the Fed reported \"widespread cooling\" in housing, including lower prices, softening sales and rising inventories of unsold homes. \"The current environment gives us slower growth opportunities in mortgage banking,\" Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo said on the conference call. He said he expects the interest-rate and competitive environment to continue to drive out weaker lenders in 2007. \"This cleansing that takes place as the markets pull back is always healthy in the long run, for both Countrywide and the industry,\" he said. Last week, Washington Mutual, the No. 3 mortgage lender and largest savings and loan, said it has cut 9,742 jobs, or 16 percent, this year. In May the parent of Ameriquest, which lends to people with weaker credit, set plans to lay off 3,800 employees, or one-third of its workforce.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) on Monday said it will launch new healthier products next year and focus on growth in emerging markets, in a continuation of the strategy that helped the world\\'s No. 2 beverage company stay profitable even as sales growth of its flagship soft drinks has slowed. \\n\\n PepsiCo\\'s new Chief Executive Indra Nooyi, who took the reins on October 1, also said the company was on track to meet its annual target of volume and revenue growth in the mid-single digits and earnings per share growth in the low double digits. Speaking at an analysts\\' conference in New York, Nooyi said she will continue to manage the company without a major departure from the strategy of her predecessor Steve Reinemund, who will retire in May. \"Those who know me ... won\\'t be surprised that (a radical shift in strategy) is not going to happen,\" Nooyi said, adding that she has been involved in the company\\'s strategic planning for the last several years. Under Reinemund\\'s watch, PepsiCo evolved from being known mostly for selling soda and salty snacks into a $33 billion food company that has embraced the push into healthier options like Tropicana juices, Aquafina water and whole grain Quaker Oats Cereals, while seeing earnings soar. From 2001 to 2005, the company\\'s earnings per share jumped 80 percent, its dividend doubled and its market capitalization increased to more than $100 billion. The company on Monday said that, moving forward, its capital expenditures as a percentage of sales would increase, and that most of the increased spending will go to expansion in developing and emerging markets and adding manufacturing capacity for Gatorade and other noncarbonated drinks. PepsiCo also affirmed its targets for midteen-range profit growth in the international unit and 7-percent growth in the North American unit. Looking ahead, Nooyi said areas ripe for growth in North America are health and wellness, natural and organic products, and premium products. Mike White, the chief executive of PepsiCo International, said concerns about health and wellness were global. Because of growing concerns about obesity, PepsiCo executives said they were not pushing international consumers to increase the serving size of their salty snacks, but to just eat them more frequently. ACQUISITIONS PepsiCo will earmark $500 million a year for tuck-in acquisitions as part of an aggressive expansion strategy, Chief Financial Officer Richard Goodman said. \"You will see more focus on acquisitions,\" said J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher, adding that the company\\'s recent success might give it flexibility to try new categories. \"Our international portfolio is an unfinished mosaic,\" said PepsiCo International\\'s White in an interview. \"There are snack companies out there in western Europe that we would like to have.\" He also said the company wanted to broaden its offerings in China, where it currently sells potato chips flavored with lemon cucumber and cherry tomato. But Nooyi said the company\\'s approach remains disciplined. \"We will not make an acquisition unless we feel convinced it\\'s the right thing to do and serves a need in our portfolio,\" she said in an interview. NEW PRODUCTS In order to develop new products for all markets, Nooyi said Pepsi would \"tangibly and dramatically\" accelerate its spending on research and development across the company. Among the innovations unveiled on Monday was a new brand of snack chips, Flat Earth, made from fruits and vegetables. On the beverage side, PepsiCo unveiled a new sparkling drink called Tava, enhanced with vitamins and chromium, which it claims has been linked to weight loss. Earlier this month, rival Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) introduced a sparkling green tea product which it said has ingredients that can speed metabolism and boost calorie-burning. PepsiCo also said it was adding a Gatorade line aimed at morning exercisers, a third flavor of its Diet Pepsi Jazz line, and rolling out vending machines that will sell hot cups of Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ) coffee in places like college campuses and offices. Pepsi already has a deal with the world\\'s largest coffee shop chain under which it sells Starbucks\\' bottled Frappuccinos, cans of Doubleshot espresso and iced coffee.',\n",

Analysts peppered HMA officials on its conference call about its ability to meet its 2006 forecast of $1.30 to $1.34 per share, given its third-quarter miss. HMA officials said uncertainty remains as to when slowing growth in patient admissions and rising rolls of uninsured will ease. \"The hospital industry is facing challenging times,\" Chief Executive Joseph Vumbacco said, adding the company is aggressively signing patients up for government insurance programs and collecting bills from those with insurance. \"This was not a very pleasing quarter for us.\" The 2006 guidance is in \"jeopardy,\" given third-quarter results, said John Ransom, an analyst at Raymond James, echoing the sentiment of other analysts. \"The company continues to struggle in what remains a challenging operating environment.\" Weak patient admissions volume and unpaid medical bills have been dragging on hospital profits in recent years amid rising numbers of those without health insurance in the United States, now at about 46 million people. Unpaid medical bills as a percentage of total revenue rose to 9.5 percent from 8.4 percent a year earlier. Adjusted admissions in the quarter declined 0.1 percent from a year ago. Third-quarter net profit fell to $74.4 million, or 31 cents per share, from $87.8 million or 35 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts said the company, which owns more than 50 acute-care hospitals in the U.S. Southeast and Southwest, earned 27 cents per share, excluding special items. The results missed the average analyst estimate of 30 cents per share, according to Reuters\\' Estimates. \"A big part of the miss versus our model was driven by higher bad debt expense,\" said Jason Gurda, an analyst at Bear Stearns. \"Overall trends remain concerning.\" Revenue rose to $994.1 million from $902.7 million a year earlier.

Third-quarter net earnings rose to $117 million, or $1.47 a share, from $114 million, or $1.66 a share, a year earlier. The results included many special items such as a gain of $40 million from an asset sale and a pension curtailment charge of $15 million. Profit from continuing operations came to $134 million, or $1.68 a share, Whirlpool said. \"Sales were better than expected and Whirlpool reiterated guidance for the full year,\" said Morgan Keegan analyst Laura Champine. Sales jumped 35 percent to $4.8 billion, boosted by the March acquisition of Maytag. Excluding Maytag, core Whirlpool sales were up 8 percent. In North America, sales rose 45 percent to $3.3 billion including Maytag. Discounting the acquisition, sales gained just 4 percent, down from a 5 percent rise in the second quarter. Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Michigan, reported good demand for new products such as its top-loading Cabrio washing machine and said price increases and savings from the Maytag acquisition helped cover rising materials costs. But it said industrywide U.S. shipments of major appliances fell about 1 percent in the quarter. Whirlpool cut its 2006 growth forecast for industrywide shipments in North America, which accounts for 68 percent of total sales, to about 1 percent. In July it forecast growth of 1 percent to 2 percent. \"The industry in the United States is softening, and that\\'s driven by higher interest rates,\" Champine said. Whirlpool\\'s third-quarter sales were up 9 percent in Europe, 32 percent in Latin America and 10 percent in Asia. The company raised its growth forecasts for industry unit shipments in Europe and Latin America, which together account for about 30 percent of total sales. Whirlpool said it sold the Amana commercial microwave and Dixie Narco vending equipment operations -- two businesses owned by its former rival -- for about $100 million during the third quarter. It said it still expects to sell the Hoover vacuum and Jade commercial appliance businesses, which it classified as discontinued operations. The Benton Harbor, Michigan, maker said it still expects full-year profit from continuing operations of $6 to $6.25 a share for 2006 and $9 a share for 2007. Analysts expect $6.13 for 2006 and $8.72 for 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. Whirlpool shares were down $3.16, or 3.5 percent, to $86.17 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

Most large PC manufacturers, including industry leaders Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. will participate in the upgrade program, although upgrade offers may vary depending on the company. The Windows Vista upgrade may be free or sold at a discount depending on the manufacturer, Microsoft added. \"There is no objections for why you\\'d want to buy a PC this holiday season, because you know you can get the upgrade,\" said Brad Brooks, general manager of Windows product marketing. Vista is Microsoft\\'s first major upgrade in five years for Windows, which sits on more than 90 percent of the world\\'s personal computers. In the first year of release, Vista will be installed on more than 100 million computers worldwide, according to research firm IDC. Microsoft\\'s Brooks estimated that between 80 percent and 85 percent of PCs sold during this holiday season will be eligible for the upgrade program. Consumers who buy a Windows XP computer at a major retailer or directly from a large manufacturer will see a designation that the PC is \"Windows Vista Capable\" and then receive a coupon for an upgrade. After Windows Vista is released, the customer will be shipped a DVD carrying the new operating system. The Windows and Office business together account for more than half of Microsoft\\'s total revenue and nearly all of its operating profit. The new Windows and Office is scheduled to be released to corporate customers before the year-end. The program will run until March 15.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Copper miner Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N on Tuesday said third-quarter profit more than doubled, but results fell short of analysts\\' forecasts due to hedging that locked the company into lower prices as copper sky-rocketed. \\n\\n The company, which has approximately $4.1 billion cash in hand, pledged to return more of it to shareholders by the end of the year. It also said new projects in the United States, Peru and Democratic Republic of Congo are expected to add 300,000 tons -- more than 10 percent -- of annual copper production to its account by late 2008. Phelps Dodge said it expects to receive another $350 million in the fourth quarter from Canadian nickel miner Inco Inc. N.TO after their proposed $17.3 billion merger fell through apart last month. Inco already paid Phelps Dodge $125 million in break-up fees. The company\\'s stock, which had risen approximately 25 percent this month since the unsuccessful Inco deal, fell over 2 percent after the earnings announcement. But analysts noted the price of copper was also down on global markets. In mid-afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Phelps shares were off $2.07, or 2 percent at $96.95. \"All in all, it was a very uneventful quarter,\" Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steven Whisler told analysts with no apparent sense of irony. The Phoenix, Arizona-based miner said third-quarter net earnings were $888 million, or $4.36 per share, compared with $366.1 million, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier. The earnings included special gains of 17 cents per share and special charges of 54 cents per share. Excluding those one-time items, earnings were $4.73 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $4.84, according to Reuters Estimates. Looking ahead, Chief Financial Officer Ramiro Peru said he expects fourth-quarter earnings in the range of $4.75 to $5.50 per share, including a $1.30 gain from Inco\\'s break-up fee. The forecast was based on an average copper price of $3.28 to $3.30 per pound. Excluding special items, the average forecast of analysts is currently $4.14 per share. Phelps Dodge said sales soared to $3.46 billion from $2.18 billion a year earlier as the price of copper touched $3.70 per pound, close to a record high around $3.80 hit in May. PROFIT HELD BACK However, profit for the last three quarters has been constrained because Phelps locked in portions of its 2006 and 2007 copper production at prices far below current market prices, which have soared six-fold in the last three years. \"I think most (analysts) excluded the collars,\" analyst Charles Bradford, of Bradford Research/Soleil, referring to the locked-in price mechanisms that constrained earnings. \"They are very difficult to calculate.\" In addition, Bradford said the gains related to the termination of its offers for Canadian mining companies, Falconbridge and Inco N.TO may not have figured in Wall Street\\'s earnings estimate calculations. The company said its copper collar programs represent about 25 percent of expected annual copper sales for 2006 and about 20 percent for 2007. Asked during the conference call with analysts about plans to dispose of the huge amount of cash the company holds, Whisler said Phelps\\' priorities were to maintain its credit rating and to reward shareholders. He noted that of $2 billion earmarked for shareholders since last year, $1.3 billion has been returned through dividends and stock repurchases. The board is looking at ways to return the remaining $700 million by year\\'s end. \"The cash situation being as it is, we need to do something sooner rather than later,\" he said. Looking ahead, the company projected a strong outlook for both copper and molybdenum markets in 2006 and balanced markets for both metals in 2007. (Additional reporting by  Carole Vaporean )',\n",
       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amazon.com on Tuesday posted third-quarter profit and revenue ahead of Wall Street expectations as the Web retailer slowed the growth of its technology spending, and its shares rose 12 percent. \\n\\n The company also reported a sharp rise in sales of electronics and a rapid adoption of its Amazon Prime shipping program. Amazon, which sells everything from books and computers to diamonds and lawnmowers, said net income in the quarter fell to $19 million, or 5 cents per share, from $30 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 24 percent to $2.31 billion. But that beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts, who on average had targeted earnings of 3 cents per share on sales of $2.25 billion, based on Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter operating income of $40 million also topped Wall Street\\'s $32.7 million target. Amazon, the second-most-popular e-commerce site behind eBay Inc., has been seen as focusing on revenue growth at the expense of profits amid intense competition. In the process, it has alienated many investors who wonder when its heavy investments will pay off. Technology and content spending rose 42 percent to $172 million, but that was a sharp deceleration from the 74 percent rise in the year-ago quarter. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt said Amazon\\'s operating profit margin was ahead of Wall Street expectations. \"It\\'s low relative to recent history, but it was above expectations, that\\'s why the stock is up so much after hours,\" he said. North American segment sales rose 21 percent to $1.26 billion, while international sales rose 29 percent to $1.05 billion. Worldwide electronics sales rose 43 percent to $699 million, accounting for 30 percent of worldwide net sales, up from 26 percent in the year-ago quarter. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said he was pleased with the rapid adoption of Amazon Prime, a membership shipping program that is costly to the company but aims to bring in new customers. Yet Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen was skeptical about whether the company had changed dramatically in the quarter. \"It\\'s not as though in the third quarter they figured out a new formula for how to be more profitable because their outlook for the fourth quarter is in line (with analyst estimates),\" he said. Amazon said it now expects fourth-quarter sales of $3.63 billion to $3.95 billion, while Wall Street on average had expected revenue of $3.69 billion. It also projected operating earnings of $145 million to $235 million for the fourth quarter, versus the Wall Street target of $178 million. The stock, which had been down 31 percent in 2006, is valued at 49 times estimated 2007 earnings, or three times that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. at 16, and an average multiple of 15 in the Standard & Poor\\'s Retailing Index. Expectations that Amazon will sharply boost its low margins mean it also trades at a premium to rival Internet stocks such as Google Inc., eBay and Yahoo Inc. Amazon shares rose to $37.68 in after-hours trade from a close of $33.63 on Nasdaq.',\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) shareholders may be rewarded if they wait out a few more months of disappointing sales, Wall Street analysts said on Tuesday, halfway through the retailer\\'s two-day investor meeting. \\n\\n Several brokerages raised their price targets on Wal-Mart\\'s stock after the world\\'s biggest retailer said on Monday that it would slow U.S. expansion and slash spending next year, freeing up cash that analysts said may be used for fatter dividends or stock buybacks. The bad news was that October sales at stores open at least a year -- a key retail measure known in industry parlance as \"comps\" -- were tracking below the company\\'s expectations. The retailer cited weak demand for trendy skinny-leg pants and its recently launched Metro 7 fashion line, as well as remodeling efforts that have disrupted stores. Wal-Mart\\'s stock tacked on another 1.1 percent to $51.84 in early New York Stock Exchange trading, adding to Monday\\'s gain of nearly 4 percent. Banc of America Securities raised its price target to $56 from $53, citing improved cash flow and return on investment, as Wal-Mart cracks down on spending. \"The completion of the remodel program coupled with less strain from energy prices should both bode well for the remainder of the year,\" the firm wrote in a note to clients. HSBC raised its price target to $55 per share from $52, pointing out that comparable-store sales growth should improve as Wal-Mart reduces the number of stores it builds close to existing ones. \"The company needs all the comp-store sales it can get, with disappointing 1 percent October comps to date on the back of weak sales in \\'skinny\\' and \\'Metro\\' lines -- two adjectives not normally used in describing Wal-Mart\\'s customer base,\" analyst Mark Husson wrote. \"Valuations don\\'t seem demanding and ought to render Wal-Mart accessible for value managers,\" he added. Bear Stearns analyst Christine Augustine kept her \"outperform\" rating on the stock even as she lowered earnings forecasts for the rest of the year. \"Aside from sluggish comp-store sales performance, we believe Wal-Mart has made substantial progress over the past year toward meeting its financial objectives including the stabilization of return on invested capital,\" she wrote. \"October comps are below plan, and apparel won\\'t be fixed this year,\" she added, explaining the earnings forecast cuts.',\n",

       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) said on Tuesday that a recall of up to 9.6 million of its personal computer batteries was overwhelming its production capacity and warned it could lose some business to its rivals. \\n\\n Besides Sony itself, major computer makers such as Dell Inc. DELL.O, Toshiba Corp. ( 6052.T ) and Apple Computer Inc. ( AAPL.O ) are recalling Sony-made lithium-ion batteries, which in rare cases can overheat and catch fire. Sony Executive Deputy President Yutaka Nakagawa told a news conference that Sony\\'s output capacity was not sufficient to supply enough new batteries to replace its customers\\' batteries while also meeting regular demand not related to the recall. Nakagawa said Sony was in talks with PC makers about enlisting the help of other battery makers to meet demand. Asked about the likelihood that some of those PC makers could take their business elsewhere and permanently reduce their reliance on Sony batteries, he said: \"We think there is a good chance for something like that to happen.\" Such a move could be a boon for Sanyo Electric Co. 6764.T, the world\\'s top maker of lithium-ion batteries in 2005, according to research firm J-Star Global. Sony ranked second while Matsushita Battery Industrial Co. came in third. Sony said it had no plans to quit its battery operations, which Morgan Stanley analyst Masahiro Ono estimated late last month would post sales of 180 billion yen ($1.5 billion) for the year to next March 31, or 2 percent of the company\\'s overall revenues. Sony does not disclose the size of its battery operations. \"The battery operation is a very important business for us. We have no intention of quitting it or scaling it down,\" Nakagawa said. \"I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for causing worries over safety of lithium-ion batteries.\" The recalls, coupled with a delay in the European launch of the PlayStation 3 game console due to a production glitch, shook consumer confidence in Sony\\'s technological competitiveness. Hit by the mounting recall costs and a widening loss at its game division, Sony last week slashed its full-year operating profit outlook by 62 percent. The Tokyo-based electronics and entertainment conglomerate has set aside 51 billion yen for costs related to the recall. It said on Tuesday it will recall about 250,000 batteries used in its Vaio notebook computers worldwide. It previously said it planned to recall 90,000 batteries in Japan and China, but did not specify the number to be recalled in other markets. The announcement was followed by comments by Toshiba, the world\\'s third-largest notebook PC maker, that it now expects to recall 870,000 laptop computer batteries made by Sony, up from its previous estimate of 830,000 units. Sony said, however, that the new figure from Toshiba was included in its projection of a global recall of up to 9.6 million batteries.

       "  ' PARIS/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A forecast-beating fourth quarter by U.S. telecommunications equipment maker Lucent offset slightly disappointing third-quarter sales from French merger partner Alcatel, boosting the shares of both companies. \\n\\n Alcatel CGEP.PA posted a modest 1.4 percent rise in third-quarter sales to 3.33 billion euros ($4.18 billion) on Tuesday -- below the expected 3.46 billion euros in a Reuters poll, as weak wireless operations undermined solid fixed network sales. However, the Paris-based group\\'s earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 258 million euros ($323.7 million), down 7.2 percent year-on-year, was largely in line with forecasts. Shares of Alcatel, which is buying Lucent, rose more than 7 percent. Lucent Technologies Inc.\\'s LU.N net profit for the fourth quarter was $371 million, or 7 cents per diluted share, including a 1 cent tax windfall, against analysts\\' expectations of 4 cents per share. Lucent\\'s shares rose 7.7 percent. Unlike Alcatel, Lucent did particularly well in wireless, thanks to software upgrades to high-speed mobile phone networks in North America, known as CDMA EV/DO Rev A. \"The good news comes from Lucent, which is why (Alcatel) shares are up,\" said analyst Richard Windsor at Nomura. Alcatel\\'s third-quarter net profit of 155 million euros, undershot expectations of 171.1 million. Neither Lucent nor Alcatel gave an earnings forecast, but Alcatel Chief Operating Office Mike Quigley did not expect competitive pressure for mobile networks to ease in the next few quarters, as most emerging markets had started the operation of their mobile networks, slowing the pace. \"The mobile market has been slowing somewhat. We think it (market growth) is probably around again mid-single digits this year in 2006,\" Quigley said in a conference call. FIXED LINE STRONG Alcatel\\'s all-share acquisition of Lucent is still awaiting approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which Alcatel expects in November. Lucent Chief Executive Patricia Russo said in an interview she did not expect U.S. approval of the roughly $14 billion deal to require any divestitures on Lucent\\'s part. The combination would create one of the world\\'s biggest suppliers of network hardware and software for mobile and high- speed Internet communications, with $25 billion in annual revenues, competing for the top spot with Cisco Systems Inc.  ( CSCO.O ). The bulk of Alcatel\\'s profits came from its wired telecoms unit, which totaled 151 million euros during the period. Sales from Internet Protocol routing products doubled in the third quarter, as telecoms operators around the world upgrade networks for television and video-on-demand services. \"We don\\'t expect that to stop any time soon. It is being driven largely by video,\" Quigley said. Revenues in the mobile segment fell to 994 million euros in the third quarter from 1.092 billion a year ago. Alcatel expects to acquire a third generation mobile phone network unit from Nortel NT.TO in early December, Chairman and Chief Executive Serge Tchuruk said in a conference call. Telecoms operators have been waiting for the deals with Nortel and Lucent to go through before making purchasing decisions, temporarily weakening Alcatel\\'s mobile order book. \"How can they (telecoms operators) buy Alcatel products if the merger with Lucent and especially with Nortel is not done yet,\" Tchuruk said. \"They cannot do otherwise but to wait.\" Lucent CEO Pat Russo, chief executive designate for the combined company, also saw customers holding off. \"We are seeing some impact as customers are pausing and seeking clarity about our decisions with respect to our product portfolio,\" she said. Some analysts said the results showed the synergies between Lucent and Alcatel were working, as Lucent\\'s earnings supported Alcatel in the third quarter and vice versa in the second quarter. But others remained skeptical. \"Lucent\\'s CDMA was strong, but it was weak in Q2. It says nothing about the health of the CDMA market, which is in terminal decline,\" said analyst Per Lindberg at Dredsner Kleinwort.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BellSouth Corp. BLS.N posted a better-than-expected rise in quarterly earnings on Tuesday as growth in wireless and high-speed Internet services helped to offset a fall in traditional land line subscriptions. \\n\\n The telecommunications carrier, which has agreed to be bought by AT&T Inc. ( T.N ), said profit, including its 40 percent stake in Cingular Wireless but excluding special items, rose 26 percent to $1.18 billion, or 65 cents a share. That beat the average forecast from analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. which showed earnings before special items of 58 cents a share. Analysts said that in addition to strong profits announced by Cingular last Friday and growth in Internet services, BellSouth\\'s bottom line was bolstered by lower advertising and capital spending ahead of its merger with AT&T. \"The beat appears to be founded on a decrease in marketing expenditures and better wireline cost controls prior to the AT&T merger,\" said Jeff Halpern, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, also noting a rise in average revenue per user. BellSouth shares were marginally lower in New York Stock Exchange trading, as investors had already expected strong earnings after Cingular\\'s results last week. Net income from continuing operations rose 30 percent to $1.06 billion, or 58 cents a share. BellSouth said earnings from Cingular were a key contributor in the quarter. Operating expenses fell 8 percent from a year earlier to $3.77 billion. AT&T, which holds the remaining 60 percent stake in Cingular, also announced firm earnings on Monday, citing strong growth in the wireless venture despite a fall in traditional phone subscribers and competition from cable companies. BellSouth\\'s access lines as of September 30 totaled 19 million, down 6.9 percent year-over-year. Retail residential lines fell 135,000, the company said, reflecting a shift to mobile phones and competition from cable providers\\' telephone services. Growth in Internet subscriptions, along with wireless communications, also helped to bolster business. Network data revenue in the quarter exceeded $1.3 billion, a 12.8 percent rise from a year earlier, it said. The company said growth in such new services, as well as cost-cutting and a rise in long-distance services, helped to boost its operating margin to 25.7 percent, a rise of 3.4 percentage points from a year earlier. \"Now that we\\'re at scale with DSL, long distance and increasingly emerging data services, all or a vast majority of the revenue from these services flows through to the margin,\" BellSouth Chief Financial Officer Pat Shannon said. Total consolidated revenue from continuing operations totaled $5.2 billion in the third quarter, up 3 percent from a year earlier. BellSouth shares were down 3 cents at $45.56 in late trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 70 percent this year. AT&T, which was down 3 cents at $34.68, has gained 40 percent so far this year.

       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE maintained its 2006 profit forecast on Wednesday after strong third-quarter profits at Mercedes and its trucks business helped absorb a 1.16 billion euros ($1.46 billion) loss at Chrysler. \\n\\n The world\\'s fifth-biggest carmaker made an operating profit of 892 million euros ($1.12 billion) -- down by half but easily beating the average of 550 million in a Reuters poll -- and said it still saw 2006 operating profit around 5 billion euros. The Stuttgart-based group, created by the 1998 merger between Germany\\'s Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler of the United States, is facing growing demand for more fuel-efficient cars in the U.S. after oil prices hit a record high earlier this year. \"DaimlerChrysler is maintaining this earnings target due to very positive business developments in the divisions Mercedes Car Group, Truck Group and Financial Services,\" it said, avoiding having to cut its outlook for the second time in 2006. Morgan Stanley said it expected market estimates to shift \"significantly higher\", especially since premium arm Mercedes was enjoying strong underlying margins even in the year\\'s weakest quarter. But Chrysler and aerospace group EADS cast long shadows over the group. Caught out by U.S. consumers\\' sudden aversion to light trucks and big sport utility vehicles given high fuel prices, Chrysler swung to an operating loss of 1.16 billion euros, in line with last month\\'s warning that its losses could hit 1.2 billion in the quarter and 1 billion in 2006. Finance chief Bodo Uebber and Chrysler head Tom LaSorda told a conference call the group was rigorously reviewing what steps were needed to rescue profits at Chrysler while it launches a string of fuel-efficient cars to energy-conscious buyers. \"We\\'ll come back with a detailed plan when we\\'re ready. But I\\'m not sitting here, sitting and thinking we\\'re going to be optimistic on everything,\" LaSorda said. He and Uebber refused to answer questions on whether selling Chrysler was ruled out. U.S. rivals General Motors ( GM.N ) and Ford ( F.N ) have also struggled on their home turf this year as Asian carmakers build market share by offering fuel-sipping alternatives to the pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles Detroit has come to love. U.S. oil prices reached a record of $78.40 in mid July but have since come down to around $60 a barrel CLc1. GM\\'s automotive business reported a net loss of $374 million in North America in the third quarter while Ford\\'s auto business there lost $2 billion before tax and special items. EADS DRAG DaimlerChrysler also said it expected the 2006 profit contribution from aerospace group Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) to lag expectations by around 200 million euros. Repeated delays in launching the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet have prompted EADS to warn of a 4.8 billion euro shortfall to expected operating profit for the years 2006 to 2010. DaimlerChrysler is cutting its EADS stake to 22.5 percent from around 30 percent and plans to sell a further 7.5 percent. Uebber said consultations on this with stakeholders including the German government would continue, but gave no more details. DaimlerChrysler group net income fell to 541 million euros from 855 million a year ago on sales of 35.2 billion, down from 38.2 billion as Chrysler sales and output shrank by a quarter. DaimlerChrysler shares rose as high as 43.95 euros and closed 4.2 percent higher at 43.23 euros, the top gainer among German blue chips  .GDAXI  and the European auto sector .SXAP. Chrysler\\'s loss eclipsed rebounding earnings at premium division Mercedes Car Group, whose operating profit rose 127 percent to 991 million euros, handily beating the poll average. Uebber said the division was on track to keep improving earnings and hit its 7 percent operating margin target in 2007. \"However, due to seasonality and the model changeover of the (Mercedes-Benz) C-Class we expect a weaker first quarter in 2007 subsequently followed by stronger quarters,\" he said. The company\\'s industry-leading trucks business boosted operating profit by 57 percent to 556 million euros amid a global boom that is now showing signs of waning. Profit at financial services rose 9 percent to 445 million. DaimlerChrysler stock has lagged the European car sector index .SXAP by around 16 percent this year given Chrysler\\'s woes.

       "  ' DETROIT/CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on Wednesday cut its worst-case estimate of its retirement cost liability at Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK, the clearest sign yet that the automaker is nearing a deal with the former subsidiary and its unions. \\n\\n GM also detailed for the first time how much it could pay to reimburse Delphi for hourly labor costs to help the parts maker cut its payroll as it emerges from bankruptcy. GM said it expected to pay less than $400 million to support Delphi\\'s work force in 2007 and less than $100 million in other ongoing payments of a limited duration. In exchange for those payments, GM said it expected to get savings on Delphi parts that would more than offset the costs. \"I\\'m cautiously optimistic, is the way I would put it,\" GM Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson said when asked if he expected a deal with Delphi to be done by the end of the year. GM said on Wednesday it expected its total liability from Delphi would be between $6 billion and $7.5 billion, compared to a prior forecast of $5.5 billion to $12 billion. Henderson said the revised estimate, which was accompanied by a $500 million charge in the third quarter, reflected progress in the talks between GM, Delphi and its unions. Analysts also said the details indicated progress in talks. However, Delphi\\'s bankruptcy negotiations include creditors, stockholders, unions, potential investors and possible buyers for some business units, making the timing unclear, they said. \"To be willing to say that ... suggests they have a firm plan and are in the final stages of negotiating it,\" Morningstar analyst John Novak said. \"There is always a risk that creditors or the equity committee could throw a wrench into this.\" Delphi, which filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. automotive history in October 2005, has outlined plans to cut several business lines, shut U.S. plants and drop thousands of its hourly and salaried workers to reorganize operations. \"We are making progress, we still have issues to resolve, but we are focused on reaching a consensual agreement and we will keep working with our stakeholders and affected parties until one is reached,\" Delphi spokeswoman Claudia Piccinin said. As part of its 1999 spin-off of Delphi, GM agreed it would remain liable for some of the retirement costs for the Troy, Michigan-based parts supplier\\'s work force if Delphi was unable to meet those obligations on its own. GM reached a deal this year with the United Auto Workers, the International Union of Electrical Workers-Communications Workers of America and Delphi under which more than 20,000 union workers opted for retirements or buyouts and another 5,000 UAW workers could return to GM. Analysts have seen that exodus as reducing the likelihood of a lengthy labor disruption at Delphi, which has the potential to force a costly shutdown at GM plants. GM\\'s estimate for its Delphi liability is a net estimate, including what it may recover in the bankruptcy process, Henderson said. \"I\\'d love to actually go through all the constituent parts, but I\\'m really not at liberty to do that today because it is frankly a matter that has got to get dealt with at the negotiating table,\" Henderson said. GM and Delphi\\'s creditors and stockholders have been locked in a dispute over whether the automaker\\'s unsecured claims against Delphi should be allowed. Delphi earlier in 2006 gave its unions two wage and benefit cutting proposals, one with less stiff cuts should GM agree to provide subsidies. Unions rejected that offer and would still need to ratify any new proposal. \"The major obstacle is how extensive are the final wage cuts going to be, how long do they last if GM is subsidizing and the ultimate level of benefits in terms of pension and health care,\" Fitch Ratings Managing Director Mark Oline said.',\n",

( GM.N ) on Wednesday posted operating earnings at the high end of Wall Street expectations, but wary investors sent the stock down more than 4 percent on expectations that the easiest part of the automaker\\'s turnaround was nearing an end. \\n\\n Improved results had been largely anticipated from GM, which lost $10.6 billion in 2005, and analysts said investor attention was shifting to whether GM would succeed in moving beyond cost-cutting as new products began hitting showrooms. \"It\\'s just not as much of a positive surprise in North America and Europe as we would have hoped for,\" Morgan Keegan analyst Pete Hastings said of GM\\'s results. GM, which is slashing more than 34,000 jobs and closing 12 plants, said it was on track to cut $9 billion in operating costs this year. \"They are still in a little bit of a honeymoon as far as cost-cutting goes,\" Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan said. GM posted a narrower net loss of $115 million, or 20 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.7 billion, or $2.94 per share a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $48.8 billion. Excluding $644 million in charges for a write-down of the value of its GMAC financial arm, the reorganization of auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK and other items, GM posted operating earnings of 93 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had expected an adjusted profit of 45 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. UNDER PRESSURE The results come at a time when Chief Executive Rick Wagoner is under pressure to show progress in the company\\'s turnaround. GM\\'s global sales fell 2.5 percent in the first nine months of 2006, as it lost market share to Japan\\'s Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ). Toyota is expected to overtake GM as the world\\'s largest automaker within a year based on current sales trends. \"The turnaround is obviously a multistage process,\" Tynan said. \"First come the cost cuts; but at some point you have to dig in and put some meat on the bones. Which means they have to look at the top line, look at making better products, look at stabilizing market share.\" GM\\'s third-quarter North American market share slipped to 24 percent from 25 percent a year earlier. GM executives are under pressure as they brace for a possible proxy fight with billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, the automaker\\'s largest individual shareholder. Kerkorian\\'s financial adviser Jerry York -- who quit the automaker\\'s board earlier this month, after GM turned down the possibility of a three-way alliance with Japan\\'s Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) and France\\'s Renault SA ( RENA.PA ) -- has flagged GM\\'s negative cash flow as an area of concern. GM said its automotive cash totaled $20.4 billion at September 30, down from $22.9 billion at June 30. That included the liquid assets of a trust fund for employee health care. Reversing cash burn is an \"important priority\" for GM, Henderson said. \"We need to get that turned around.\" DELPHI DEAL NEAR? GM narrowed the range of its estimated exposure for benefit guarantees to bankrupt Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK to between $6 billion and $7.5 billion, from a previous estimate of $5.5 billion to $12 billion -- indicating a deal was drawing closer. GM, which spun off Delphi in 1999, has been in talks with the parts supplier and its unions over a cost-saving labor deal that would allow Delphi to emerge from bankruptcy. A deal between the United Auto Workers union, Delphi and GM would avert a strike that could otherwise shut down GM\\'s production and force it to burn through billions of dollars a week. \"We continue to believe Delphi will (reach a deal) without a labor disruption, though we also believe this is the strong consensus view at this point,\" Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold wrote in a research note. Nesvold said that a Delphi deal could be a trigger for investors to take profits on GM\\'s rally. In another closely watched matter, GM said it was on track to close its $14 billion sale of a 51 percent stake in GMAC in the fourth quarter, earlier than some analysts had expected. GM shares, which reached a 52-week high on Tuesday, fell $1.76, or 4.9 percent, to $34.43 in late Wednesday afternoon trade. GM\\'s forward price-to-earnings ratio, based on 2007 estimates, was 7.6 compared with a ratio of about 18 for the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index. GM typically trades at a discount of up to 50 percent to the broad market because of the cyclical nature of the auto industry. The stock remains up almost 78 percent since the start of the year.

       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan\\'s Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) posted a surprise drop in quarterly net profit on Wednesday due to finance-related losses, but it raised its full-year forecasts to adjust for a weaker yen. \\n\\n At the operating level, Japan\\'s No. 3 auto maker beat market estimates with a 19 percent jump to a record profit for the second business quarter, thanks partly to brisk car sales in North America, India and China. But the main catalyst for that rise was a favorable slide in the yen\\'s value -- by 5 yen against the dollar and 12 yen to the euro -- which wiped out all the negatives including bigger outlays for raw materials and sales incentives. Domestic rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ) are also enjoying windfall currency gains, even as some U.S. and European auto makers announce dismal results amid sliding sales and production cutbacks. Nissan is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, followed by Toyota on November 7. For the full year to end-March, Honda, which relies on North America for the majority of its profits, lifted its operating profit forecast to 820 billion yen ($6.9 billion) from the previous 750 billion. A softer-than-assumed Japanese currency contributed 91 billion yen -- more than the margin of revision. The positive impact from its core vehicle sales business is now expected to shrink as a shift in consumer demand toward smaller cars hurts its product mix -- meaning thinner margins. \"We all know that forex is the main reason behind Honda\\'s upward revision, which could be followed by similar moves by other auto makers,\" said Takashi Miyazaki, general manager of the investment strategy division at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management. \"But because of that I see the risk of the yen strengthening.\" Full-year net profit is now seen at 555 billion yen instead of 550 billion. Honda changed its assumptions for the average values of the dollar and the euro for the year, to 115 yen per dollar from 112 and to 145 yen per euro from 139. The dollar is trading just under 120 yen and the euro around 150 yen. July-September net profit at Honda fell 4.3 percent to 127.91 billion yen ($1.07 billion), hit by valuation losses on financial instruments and a difficult comparison with last year\\'s big derivatives-related gains. The net profit lagged an estimate of 135.5 billion yen by five brokerages surveyed by Reuters Estimates. Operating profit, which strips out earnings from 44 affiliates in China and other parts of Asia, totaled 193.02 billion yen as revenue grew 12.5 percent to 2.63 trillion yen. COMPACT CAR SHIFT Powered by a fleet of fuel-efficient cars against the backdrop of high gasoline prices, Honda is winning drivers in North America and Europe, especially with the remodeled Civic sedan, although analysts said a supply shortage of such popular models is holding back volume growth globally. At the same time, consumers\\' preference for smaller cars was also forcing bigger spending on deal-sweeteners for larger vehicles, especially in the United States, Honda said. \"There\\'s a global shift toward compact cars, and that\\'s led to a worsening model mix,\" Fumihiko Ike, a director at Honda, told a news conference. Executive Vice President Satoshi Aoki said Honda was budgeting an additional $40 million to $50 million in sales costs in the United States, where competitors are piling on discounts on larger sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. Still, Honda said its results were generally within expectations apart from the yen\\'s swing, and lifted its planned dividend payout to 64 yen a share for the full year from 60 yen. It said it would pay a quarterly dividend for the first time -- 17 yen at the end of each of the remaining quarters. Honda\\'s fortunes contrast sharply with those of Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, which have been wrongfooted by U.S. consumers\\' shift away from big sport utility vehicles in favor of fuel-efficient cars. Ford on Monday posted a quarterly loss of $5.8 billion -- its largest loss in 14 years -- while DaimlerChrysler last month slashed 1 billion euros off its original 2006 operating profit forecast on mounting losses at the U.S. Chrysler arm. Honda\\'s global car sales in the second quarter rose 6.0 percent to 884,000 units. But it nudged down its full-year forecast, by 20,000 units, to account for weak domestic sales. Analysts said Honda\\'s overall volume growth would continue to be hampered by supply constraints for four-cylinder engines, which power the small Civic and Fit models, adding the bottleneck would persist at least through the current quarter. To address those issues, Honda said on Tuesday it would rejig output arrangements at two of its North American factories to allow for the production of up to 60,000 more Civics a year starting in April. Honda shares gained 9.4 percent in July-September, beating a 6.9 percent rise in the transport sector subindex .ITEQP.T. The stock ended down 1 percent at 4,070 yen on Wednesday before the results were announced. ($1=119.20 Yen) (Additional reporting by Risa Maeda)',\n",
       "  \" CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Johnson Controls Inc. ( JCI.N ) on Wednesday said quarterly earnings rose 27.2 percent, driven by strength in building temperature controls and batteries, while its auto interiors business remained under pressure. \\n\\n Net income rose to $360 million, or $1.82 per share, in its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, from $283 million, or $1.45 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 18.1 percent to $8.15 billion. Earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.86, while analysts on average expected Johnson Controls to earn $1.85 per share, with revenue of $8.16 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Johnson Controls earlier in October said it expected a slow start to fiscal 2007 because of production cuts by North American automakers, but forecast earnings per share growth of 14 percent for the year. The Milwaukee company acquired York International to boost its building heating and cooling systems, and the battery business of bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK to add to a large position in auto batteries. Sales in its building efficiency business more than doubled to $3.1 billion in the quarter, supported by the York acquisition, while battery sales rose 14 percent to $981 million. Auto interiors sales fell 11 percent to $4 billion. Auto interiors sales fell 19 percent in North America due to lower vehicle production and a focus on light trucks, the company said. European interiors sales fell 3 percent. Operating income rose 118 percent to $253 million in building controls, rose 23 percent to $140 million in batteries and fell 46 percent to $112 million in auto interiors in the fourth quarter, Johnson Controls said. Johnson Controls plans to cut about 5,000 jobs and 16 plants by about the middle of 2007 in a restructuring focused mainly on auto interiors and building controls systems. Several U.S. auto parts suppliers have warned that production cuts by General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler AG's DCX.N DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group would hurt results in the last few months of 2006. Unlike most U.S. auto parts makers, Johnson Controls has had substantial non-automotive growth. Building controls accounted for nearly one-third of fiscal 2006 revenue and it expects that percentage to increase in fiscal 2007. Johnson Controls expects auto interiors revenue to decline by up to 5 percent in fiscal 2007, with 25 percent growth in building temperature controls systems and 5 percent growth in battery business sales more than offsetting that pressure. The company earlier in October said it expects fiscal first-quarter earnings per share of 80 cents to 85 cents, while analysts expect 84 cents. Johnson Controls also has forecast earnings per share of about $6 for fiscal 2007, with revenue of about $34 billion. Analysts expect $6.03 per share and revenue of $34.31 billion. Results were released after the close on the New York Stock Exchange. Johnson Controls rose to $82.74 in trading after the market closed, up from its $82.47 close on the NYSE. The shares have risen about 13 percent so far in 2006, while the Dow Jones U.S. automobiles and parts index .DJUSAP is up nearly 17 percent.\",\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials were universally expected to decide on Wednesday to keep interest rates steady but could heighten a warning on inflation to make clear they will raise rates again if needed. \\n\\n The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee resumed meeting for a second day at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) and was to announce a decision at about 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT). Financial markets were calm ahead of the decision, with U.S. stock futures buoyed by strong earnings, as investors evidently were betting heavily on no change in rates. Keeping the bellwether federal funds rate at 5.25 percent would extend the pause policy-makers initiated on August 8 after a more than two-year cycle of 17 straight quarter-point increases. Economists have noted signs of economic slowing since early August that appear to justify the rate halt. But the tenor of policy-makers\\' comments on inflation has led to questions on whether the next rate move, when it happens, will be up or down. \"The odds favor a gradual reduction in core inflation over the next year or so,\" Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said three weeks ago. But \"important upside risks to the outlook for inflation warrant continued vigilance on the part of the central bank.\" The remarks by Kohn, who served as former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\\'s chief strategist and is regarded as market-savvy on a heavily academic Fed board, set a tone that helped nip a perception that the only future direction for rates was down. Already, one FOMC member -- Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker -- has taken the relatively rare step of dissenting at the past two meetings in August and September from the majority opinion to keep rates on hold. Lacker felt rate rises were needed to tamp inflation pressures down more rapidly. In addition, Fed staff revised down estimates of the economy\\'s noninflationary potential in forecasts outlined at FOMC meetings in August and September, which has caught the attention of financial markets by implying a greater slowdown than previously thought may be needed to ease price pressures. WARY ON PRICES Minutes from the September meeting issued on October 11 showed policy-makers were \"quite concerned\" about inflation and also about the possibility their own credibility could be brought into question if inflation did not recede as they hoped. Ben Bernanke, who took over as Fed chairman on February 1, said in a question-and-answer session after an address earlier this month the inflation rate \"is still above what we would consider price stability\" and pledged the central bank stood prepared to act if needed. \"We do believe inflation is going to come down gradually over time, but it\\'s something we have to watch very carefully to make sure that it doesn\\'t rise or even remain where it is,\" Bernanke said. The U.S. consumer price index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the first nine months this year, well above the 2.2 percent posted for all of 2005 and outside the generally perceived 1 percent to 2 percent \"comfort zone\" for policy-makers. Federal funds futures contracts have crossed out hopes for a series of rate cuts next year and now see some chance borrowing costs could move up as early as the first quarter. One reason appears to be that economic growth, while slowing, remains resilient enough in the face of costlier energy and falling house prices to keep inflation worries alive. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in a radio interview on Tuesday that surging stock prices offset some concern about home prices, which could potentially fuel spending and keep price pressures alive. The two-day FOMC meeting was to allow time to debate a push by Bernanke for the Fed to become more open, or at least to mull options up to and including adopting a target for inflation to guide the U.S. central bank\\'s decision-making. Any decisions are expected well into the future and some FOMC members, like Kohn who is not an inflation targeter, left no doubt the discussions on more openness were in the early stages. \"We\\'ll begin to talk about whether there are some ways to better anchor expectations without putting ourself in a straitjacket,\" Kohn said during the summer.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept its benchmark interest rate steady for a third meeting in a row, predicting moderate economic growth ahead with some reason to expect easing price pressures. \\n\\n The statement from the Fed\\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee seemed to imply U.S. central bank policy-makers felt most of a slowdown stemming from a weak housing sector was past and that the economic expansion was on a solid footing. \"The economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace,\" the Fed said in five paragraphs announcing it was keeping its overnight federal funds rate target at 5.25 percent, the level reached in June after 17 straight increases since mid-2004. The Fed said core inflation rates had been \\'elevated\\' but thought this should ease because there was less impact from higher energy prices, inflation expectations were contained, and prior rate rises had put a restraint on spending. Only Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker, who has been pressing for higher borrowing costs, disagreed. He voted against the majority for a third straight time, the longest string of dissents since former Cleveland Fed President Jerry Jordan did so four times in 1998. The policy-makers took no options off the table, leaving room to either raise or lower rates by saying \"some inflation risks remain\". They also said they will monitor data to judge prospects for both inflation and growth. A Reuters poll of 17 primary dealers -- big Wall Street firms that deal directly with the Fed -- found only one expects the Fed to raise rates at its next meeting on December 12. Eleven of the 17 felt the next rate move would be a cut, while four anticipated a rate rise. That fit with most perceptions immediately after Wednesday\\'s announcement. \"There\\'s nothing here changing the view ... that the Fed\\'s inclination is to stand pat for some time but with a slight bias toward tightening if inflation gains hold,\" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist with RBS Greenwich Capital in New York. \"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these (inflation) risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth,\" the FOMC said in its statement, which closely mirrored the one accompanying its last rate announcement on September 20. The statement seemed to reassure investors, despite being little changed from the previous one. In futures trading, the chances the Fed will lift rates another quarter percentage point by January dropped to 10 percent from 16 Tuesday. Bond prices rallied in relief that the Fed had not struck a more hawkish tone on inflation as many market observers had suggested was possible. Two-year U.S. Treasury notes US2YT=RR, which respond closely to expectations for Fed interest rate moves, traded up 3/32 in price to yield 4.85 percent, versus 4.88 percent just before the Fed announcement and 4.92 percent on Tuesday. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR rose 14/32 for a yield of 4.77 percent, versus 4.81 percent just before the announcement and 4.83 percent late on Tuesday. \"The Fed remains committed to keeping inflationary pressures contained,\" said Kevin Flanagan, a strategist for global wealth management with Morgan Stanley in Purchase, N.Y. \"You don\\'t get a sense of urgency at this point ... that the Fed needs to take that next step and raise rates,\" he added. Stock prices closed modestly higher, influenced more by corporate earnings reports than by the widely anticipated Fed decision. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 6.80 points, to close at a record 12,134.68. There were new signs of economic cooling even before the Fed wrapped up its two-day meeting. A realtors\\' group reported U.S. sales of existing homes fell for a sixth straight month in September and median prices were down from a year ago. But price pressures have stayed high despite some economic slowing and it is evident that the Fed remains wary. The core U.S. consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the first nine months of this year, well above the 2.2 percent posted for all of 2005 and outside the generally perceived 1 percent to 2 percent \"comfort zone\" for Fed policy-makers. The latest meeting was a two-day one to allow discussion on improving communications with the public, but the statement said nothing about what changes might be made or when.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. existing home sales slipped for a sixth straight month in September, a real estate group said on Wednesday, underscoring a weak spot in the economy that some analysts think could lead to lower interest rates next year. \\n\\n Just hours before an announcement from the Federal Reserve that it was holding the federal funds rate steady, the National Association of Realtors said home resales slowed to an annual rate of 6.18 million from a 6.30 million pace in August. It was the slowest sales pace since January 2004, when they were ramping up during a multiyear boom. In addition, median home prices fell 2.2 percent from a year earlier, matching a drop in August that was the first decline since April 1995. Prices for U.S. government bonds rose on home sales decline, which was bigger than expected on Wall Street. Bonds gained further after the Fed\\'s afternoon decision on the view that the next move on interest rates might be down. In announcing its decision to hold the overnight fed funds rate at 5.25 percent, the Fed cited the \"cooling housing market\" as a factor that has slowed economic growth. While the Fed\\'s statement also noted that \"some inflation risks remain,\" analysts saw the home sales weakness as a signal that higher interest rates might not be needed. \"This suggests that we still have a very weak housing market and that housing will probably (continue) be a drag on the economy,\" Gary Thayer, chief economist with A.G. Edwards & Sons of St. Louis, said of Wednesday\\'s data. WORST OVER? After shooting ahead at an annual 5.6 percent pace in the first three months of the year, economic growth slowed to just a 2.6 percent rate in the second quarter. Economists polled by Reuters expect growth slowed further in the third quarter. The government reports on third quarter growth on Friday, and the consensus forecast is for a 2.2 percent advance. Still, the realtors\\' report contained hints the housing market may be stabilizing after its sharp slump. The inventory of homes for sale fell 2.4 percent, or 93,000 units, to 3.75 million, its second consecutive drop, although the number of unsold homes on the market remained at a relatively high 7.3 months\\' supply. \"The peak in the housing inventory is likely to have passed,\" said Lawrence Yun, an economist with the NAR. \"We expect a further steady decline in inventory over the next several months,\" he said, adding that the current buyers\\' market will likely become a more balanced market by spring. While the market may be finding a balance, analysts said the risk that housing-sector weakness could pull the overall economy lower would likely remain on the minds of Fed officials as they consider the future course of interest rates. \"It looks like the supply side of the market is starting to play ball,\" said Gregory Miller, chief economist for SunTrust Banks in Atlanta. \"Home owners had been holding their prices pretty sticky until the last two months. Now it looks like both sides of the market have conceded.\" A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed U.S. mortgage applications rose slightly last week, reflecting an increase in demand for home refinancing loans. The MBA\\'s mortgage application activity index, which covers both refinancing and purchasing loans, increased 0.5 percent in the week to October 20 to 588.6, its first rise in three weeks. In another report, the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank said its national activity index dipped to -0.51 in September from -0.06 in August, suggesting the economy is only moving sluggishly.

Inflationary pressures are out there, but we will see some relief with the economy slowing. Some had thought they would be easing, but I don\\'t think they will be easing until the second quarter at the earliest next year. \"(Stocks) are rallying on a little relief rally that they didn\\'t raise rates.\"  BARRY HYMAN, EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, EKN FINANCIAL SERVICES  INC., NEW YORK: \"I don\\'t think there are any surprises ... A measured commentary, telling us that inflation can be maintained with energy prices staying at moderate levels, but still warning that you have to watch the data. It was maybe a little less hawkish than some people anticipated, and this is coming within the background of a very strong earnings quarter. The trend in the (stock) market is still up, so anything that is not super disturbing can be interpreted as slightly positive.\"  KEVIN FLANAGAN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, GLOBAL WEALTH  MANAGEMENT, MORGAN STANLEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: \"The market may have been gearing itself up for a more hawkish statement: that is why you are seeing some kneejerk buying. \"It really doesn\\'t change the outlook for rates going forward, The Fed remains committed to keeping inflationary pressures contained.

We\\'re in the same situation we were in a month ago. Probably the most significant element of the statement was the second sentence, when the Fed said the economy is likely to expand at a moderate pace. If anything, it would be somewhat negative for the dollar. So long as the Fed continues to see the economy expanding at a moderate pace, it\\'s unlikely we\\'ll see further tightening. If that\\'s the case, that means dollar support erodes over time.\"  RICHARD DEKASER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIONAL CITY CORP.,  CLEVELAND, OHIO: \"The Fed remains firstly preoccupied with inflation risks. A distance second is a concern about growth. \"They dropped the reference to energy and commodities.

The fed funds futures don\\'t see the Fed making a move until the third quarter 2007. \"My read on the Fed is more hawkish than what the market is reading. The Fed is more biased on a hike than an ease.\"  JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK,  CHICAGO: \"The picture I got from this so far is that the Fed really wants to see evidence of slowing inflation before they make any move to lower interest rates. As long as the economy and energy prices cooperate to help stem any growth in inflation, then the Fed can sit on sidelines and watch, but they\\'re going to want some concrete proof that inflation is slowing before they take any action on the fed funds rate. \"Both stocks and bonds have popped up in reaction because the concern was that we might have an impending rate hike in the future and that message wasn\\'t sent in the statement. Stocks have rallied about 20 points just in the past few minutes. \"It appears the bond market vigilantes have retired because they don\\'t appear too aggressive in reaction to this news.\"  MARKET REACTION: - U.S. Treasury debt prices extend gains after Fed statement less hawkish than feared. \\n- U.S. rate futures steady as Fed keeps rates on hold, cites inflation risks.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), the No. 3 U.S. oil company, on Wednesday said third-quarter earnings rose slightly from a year before as improvements in chemicals, pipeline, and refining and marketing operations offset production problems and charges from tax law changes. \\n\\n But the quarterly profit was much lower than the windfall earnings the company posted in the second quarter, and the retreat of oil prices from sky-high levels has led many investors and analysts to speculate that the days of record oil company profits are nearing their end. \"I think we\\'ve seen peak earnings for all these companies,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Fadel Gheit. \"What goes up in this business comes down ... Basically, all they are praying for is a soft landing,\" he said. Net income in the quarter rose to $3.88 billion from $3.80 billion last year. On a per share basis, earnings fell to $2.31 a share from $2.68 a share in the year-earlier quarter. The company\\'s third-quarter earnings include results from ConocoPhillips\\' acquisition of Burlington Resources earlier this year. The deal increased the company\\'s share count to 1.68 billion shares from 1.42 billion shares a year before. ConocoPhillips said its third-quarter earnings were hurt by 37 cents per share in items including charges from new taxes in the United Kingdom and Alaska, an impairment charge on assets up for sale, and a benefit from business interruption insurance. Excluding these items, the company earned about $2.68 a share, well above the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates of $2.37 a share. Revenue in the quarter dipped to $48.4 billion from $48.7 billion a year earlier. PRODUCTION DOWN FROM Q2 Daily production from the exploration and production segment rose to 2.04 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in the quarter from 1.52 million BOE in the year-ago period, excluding ConocoPhillips\\' stake in Russia\\'s Lukoil ( LKOH.MM ). But that result marked a decline from production of 2.13 BOE per day in the second quarter. ConocoPhillips said the dip in third-quarter production was mostly on problems at Alaska\\'s Prudhoe Bay, which was shut down by operator BP Plc ( BP.L ) in August because of a leaking pipeline and planned maintenance in the United Kingdom and Venezuela. ConocoPhillips owns more than 36 percent of the Prudhoe Bay field. The company said it expects production to increase from third-quarter levels in the fourth quarter due to the resumption of operations in Prudhoe Bay and less downtime, partially offset by shifts in its production-sharing contracts in the Timor Sea. The company said it expects a fourth-quarter crude oil refining capacity utilization rate similar to the 95 percent average worldwide utilization rate it logged in the third quarter. Speaking on the company\\'s conference call, Chief Executive Jim Mulva said he expects 2007 capital spending to be around $15 billion or $16 billion, but said it was \"very likely\" that the company would not complete all of its proposed refining projects, including one in Saudi Arabia, as it looks to restrain spending. \"We are very pleased about the opportunity in Saudi Arabia but have quite a number of these (projects),\" he said. \"We frankly are going to have to step back and assess capital costs, whether we think it makes sense for us to commit capital to do all these projects.\" U.S. oil prices hit a record high of $78.40 a barrel in early June and spent much of the third quarter hovering above $70 before retreating to around $60 as the summer driving season ended and geopolitical tensions eased. The company said its average realized crude oil price for the quarter was $65.05, up from $56.64 a year before. Rival BP announced a 58 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by asset sales. Hess Corp. ( HES.N ) also posted a higher profit, helped by higher oil prices. Shares of ConocoPhillips rose $1.32, or 2.15 percent, to $62.72 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They are up about 8 percent since the beginning of the year, well underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange\\'s oil index .OIX which is up about 20 percent in the same period.',\n",
       "  ' YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia  (Reuters) - Russian Natural Resources Minister Yuri Trutnev heaped more pressure on Shell\\'s ( RDSa.L ) Sakhalin-2 project on Wednesday with an order for a prolonged environmental probe and a threat of prosecution. \\n\\n At a meeting with environmental inspectors and project operator Sakhalin Energy on Sakhalin Island in the Pacific, Trutnev said he wanted criminal prosecutors to investigate the environmental record of the $22 billion venture. \"The breaches at Sakhalin-2 fall under five articles of the criminal code,\" Trutnev said. \"This falls under criminal law and we think it\\'s necessary to apply it. All the relevant documents should be sent to the Prosecutor General within two weeks.\" Pressure is building on many foreign operators in Russia, and analysts suspect a Kremlin push for more control of the multi-billion dollar energy industry. The most intense scrutiny has been directed at Royal Dutch Shell and the vast Sakhalin-2 project it leads on Sakhalin. He said the environmental inspectors\\' investigation would last a further month -- a blow to Shell and its partners in the world\\'s largest single oil and gas project, Japan\\'s Mitsui & Co. ( 8031.T ) and Mitsubishi Corp. ( 8058.T ). Import-dependent Japan is looking to Sakhalin to meet much of its future energy needs. Last month, after Russia revoked environmental approval for Sakhalin-2, Japan said a major delay could hurt diplomatic relations. The European Commission said at the time it too was taking the move very seriously. SUSPENSION TALK IS PREMATURE Trutnev said the inspectors\\' investigation could lead to the revocation of Sakhalin-2\\'s water-use license, a permit needed for construction of many of the project\\'s facilities. But he said it was premature to talk about suspension of work. \"I would not want to make a statement now about whether the project will be suspended or not,\" he said. However, he said his ministry was analysing whether work should be suspended on several stretches of the north-south pipeline connecting Sakhalin-2\\'s wells to an export terminal and the liquefied natural gas plant the venture is now building. Damage to the island\\'s ecology, such as illegal tree felling, was significant and Sakhalin Energy could expect fines, he said. An audit of the damage would take four months. Ian Craig, chief executive of Sakhalin Energy, said the firm was committed to resolving any environmental breaches. There was no comment from Shell or its Japanese partners. \"Every problem will be dealt with in the correct manner and in full partnership, openness and transparency with the supervisory agencies,\" Craig said in remarks translated back from Russian. \"The current situation could lead to some delays in completing certain elements of the project, but it will in no way lead to a delay in the project as a whole,\" he later told reporters. Dmitry Belanovich, acting head of environmental watchdog RosPrirodNadzor on Sakhalin, said the project\\'s execution had changed so much since the agreed feasibility study that it was hard to draw definite conclusions and more study was needed. \"The operator is lessening the complexity of the project, ignoring implementation of a whole raft of environmental measures,\" he said. \"There are so many changes and additions to the project plan that they are no longer conforming to the agreed plan and the state environmental review.\" ZEALOUS Some analysts have accused Russia of double standards, applying environmental legislation with zeal when foreign firms are involved but looking the other way when oil leaks from Russian-operated pipelines. The most recent spill was in the Urals earlier this week when 300 tonnes of oil seeped from a pipeline, covering 5,500 square metres and polluting a river. Shell has spent upwards of $10 billion on Sakhalin-2, on the remote, mountainous island of Sakhalin, which is freezing cold in winter. The project is due to go on stream in 2008 and much of the initial production has already found customers. Other foreign-led oil and gas projects targeted by Russia in recent months include ExxonMobil\\'s ( XOM.N ) neighbouring Sakhalin-1, Total\\'s ( TOTF.PA ) Kharyaga venture and TNK-BP\\'s ( BP.L ) Kovytka development.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. ( BUD.N ) on Wednesday said quarterly profit rose on higher prices and easing energy costs, narrowly beating Wall Street\\'s view and sending shares up 2 percent. \\n\\n The largest U.S. brewer, whose flagship brands include Budweiser and Bud Light, said third-quarter net income rose 26 percent to $638 million, or 82 cents per share, from $505 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting profit of 81 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales for the quarter rose 4.7 percent to $4.28 billion and total beer volume rose 2.9 percent, driven by a 2.8 percent rise in revenue per barrel, as Anheuser raised prices in some markets during the summer. The company said it plans to raise prices again on most of its volume early next year, with a few selective increases in the fourth quarter. Last year, the company took price cuts amid sluggish growth in the U.S. beer market, forcing competitors like Miller Brewing Co., a unit of SABMiller Plc ( SAB.L ), to follow suit. DOMESTIC GOING FLAT Anheuser-Busch, whose Bud Light is the top-selling brand in the United States, controls about half the U.S. beer market. But Bud Light\\'s dominance is being challenged by imported light beers, such as Heineken Premium Light. Volume of beer shipments to domestic wholesalers rose 1.1 percent during the quarter, but sales from wholesalers to retailers fell 0.4 percent. \"Sales to retailers were below our expectations due to a slowdown in September,\" Anheuser\\'s Chief Financial Officer W. Randolph Baker said on a conference call. He blamed unfavorable weather, especially during the Labor Day holiday, and said he did not think it was a long-term trend. Bear Stearns analyst Carlos Laboy said the lag implied there was now a \"considerable\" build-up of inventory. In a research note he said the next two quarters \"could be messy\" as Anheuser faces tough comparisons and two more inventory days. J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher said he thought the market had already anticipated such problems, which explained why the stock rose 97 cents to close at $47.86 on the New York Stock Exchange, reversing much of a 4 percent drop over the last week. INTERNATIONAL BUBBLING Volume in the company\\'s international unit rose 5.9 percent, helped by strength in Canada, China and Mexico. That segment\\'s sales also includes domestic sales of some foreign beers. Earlier this year the company bought Rolling Rock beer from Belgium\\'s InBev INTB.BR. That followed its moves to exclusively import and distribute Dutch brewer Grolsch NV\\'s GROLc.AS beers in the U.S. and exclusively import Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd.\\'s Tiger beer. Anheuser also has a 50 percent stake in Mexico\\'s Grupo Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ), which brews Corona, and a 27 percent stake in China\\'s Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd. ( 600600.SS ). These moves are ways for the U.S. brewer to capitalize on the growing popularity of imported and craft beers, which, along with wine and spirits, have been grabbing market share from domestic beers. In response to a question about the growing threat of imported beers, CFO Baker acknowledged that the success of Heineken NV\\'S ( HEIN.AS ) light beer and other imports were hurting sales, but said those volumes remained small. Looking ahead, the St. Louis, Missouri-based company said it will focus on marketing its flagship American beers. NEW PRODUCTS Anheuser-Busch also said it was still studying a hard liquor product in test markets called Jekyll and Hyde. \"We continue to see whether there are opportunities for products that fit into our portfolio that would be profitable for our wholesalers as well as Anheuser-Busch,\" Baker said. This autumn the company is rolling out bottles of a seasonal craft brew called Jack\\'s Pumpkin Spice Ale, which was previously only available by draught. Anheuser-Busch shares have gained 9.3 percent this year and trade at 18.5 times earnings estimates for the current year, outperforming a 2.5 percent gain for rival Molson Coors Brewing Co., ( TAP.N ) which has a price-to-earnings multiple of 17.4.',\n",
       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Private equity groups Blackstone BG.UL and PAI Partners said on Wednesday they had agreed to buy Britain\\'s biggest biscuit maker, United Biscuits, for just over 1.6 billion pounds ($3 billion), including debt. \\n\\n The price tag is a little less than the 1.7 billion pounds originally expected for the maker of McVitie\\'s Jaffa Cakes and Jacob\\'s Cream Crackers. In the deal, PAI will increase its current 40 percent stake in United Biscuits to about 50 percent. United Biscuits (UB) is Europe\\'s second-largest biscuit maker after France\\'s Danone ( DANO.PA ), and its brands include Penguin and go ahead! biscuits and snacks such as Hula Hoops, KP Nuts, Mini Cheddars and Skips. The business has 15 manufacturing plants in western Europe and a 9,000 workforce, with 7,500 in the UK. Blackstone and PAI said the deal would be financed through a combination of equity, which would be contributed equally by the two groups, and debt financing committed by Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. The private equity firms declined to say how much debt they were taking on. UB management will also participate in the ownership of the business, and the deal is expected to close by December 2006, Blackstone and PAI said. PAI led a 1.26 billion pound buyout of UB in 2000 with fellow private equity groups Cinven CINV.UL and MidOcean Partners, as well as U.S. food giant Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N. Kraft transferred its 25 percent stake in July to its three private equity partners and, in exchange, took over UB\\'s Spanish and Portuguese operations. That left PAI and Cinven each with 40 percent stakes and MidOcean with 20 percent. PENSION DEFICIT CONCERNS Last month, Britain\\'s Premier Foods ( PFD.L ), whose brands include Branston Pickle and Angel Delight desserts, pulled out of the bidding for UB, leaving Blackstone as the only bidder left in the auction. Cinven said in a statement that both its and MidOcean\\'s interests in United Biscuits had generated returns of 2.2 times the cost of investment. The firm, founded in 1948 following the merger of two Scottish family businesses, made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 202 million pounds in 2005 on revenues of 1.44 billion. Britain\\'s Transport and General Workers Union (T&G), which has nearly 900 members at UB, called on Blackstone and PAI to take action to reduce the firm\\'s pension deficit. \"Private equity deals are invariably struck for quick returns for shareholders,\" Brian Revell, T&G national organizer for food and agriculture said in a statement. \"We believe there should be a cash injection to show this is not a quick-fix deal but a longer-term investment.\" United Biscuits said in an emailed statement that its new shareholders would make a \"significant lump sum payment\" into the deficit, which it said was 213 million pounds. It declined to put a figure on the payment. PAI and Blackstone were not immediately available to say what plans they had for the pension deficit. The two private equity firms were advised by JP Morgan, Herbert Smith and Simpson Thatcher, while UB was advised by Goldman Sachs and Allen & Overy.',\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ), on Wednesday said quarterly profit fell less than 1 percent due to charges and forecast double-digit earnings-per-share growth through next year and beyond, pushing its shares up more than 3 percent. \\n\\n Excluding restructuring charges, profit rose and topped Wall Street\\'s forecast. Sales were also higher than expected and a new high-end toothpaste from Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) did not pressure Colgate as much as some had anticipated. \"Net, this was a remarkably strong, high quality quarter,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Pecoriello. Third-quarter profit at the maker of its namesake toothpaste and dish soap fell to $344.1 million, or 63 cents per share, from $347.2 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of stock-based compensation in the latest period, and excluding restructuring charges a year ago, Colgate earned $421.5 million, or 77 cents per share, up from $369.7 million, or 67 cents per share. Excluding the restructuring charges, but including stock-based compensation charges, Colgate earned 73 cents per share in the latest quarter, topping Wall Street\\'s consensus view by a penny, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8 percent to $3.14 billion, above the analysts\\' average estimate of just under $3.08 billion. \"The quality of the numbers they reported were as good as any we have seen in the sector recently,\" said Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, who rates Colgate stock as \"outperform.\" During a conference call, Hott and others asked Chief Executive Reuben Mark about how Colgate has performed against Crest Pro-Health, the new toothpaste from P&G. Mark said, in his view, Pro-Health has not grown as much as Colgate Total did when it was launched in 1997 and that Colgate was defending itself well. \"Bring them on,\" said Mark. Colgate said its share of the U.S. toothpaste market rose to 37.4 percent year to date, up 40 basis points from a year earlier and more than 3 share points ahead of Crest, citing ACNielsen market share data. Colgate Total led that growth, posting a record high market share of 15.2 percent. \"Pro Health is so far not the death knell of Colgate,\" Hott said. P&G gives its results next week. Colgate unveiled a restructuring plan in 2004 that included cutting 12 percent of its work force and closing one-third of its factories. On Wednesday, it said savings from that program could come in slightly above its original expectations. Mark also said that the company would not chase acquisitions, and feels that Colgate can generate volume growth ahead of its historical growth with its existing businesses. Colgate, which also makes Ajax cleanser and Hill\\'s Science Diet pet food, expects to post double-digit earnings-per-share growth this year, excluding restructuring and stock-based compensation charges, with the same seen in 2007. President and Chief Operating Officer Ian Cook, who will become CEO in the middle of 2007, said that the restructuring and other plans should also help Colgate post double-digit earnings-per-share growth beyond 2007. Mark also said that Colgate\\'s raw material costs should be up just 0.8 percent this year, after earlier forecasting a 1.7 percent increase. Shares of Colgate, which is now focused on profitable areas such as oral care, personal care and pet food, rose 3.7 percent during the quarter, while the six-company S&P Household & Personal Products Index .GSPHHPE, which includes Colgate, advanced 8.9 percent. The stock was up $1.90 at $62.37 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising to $62.52.',\n",
       "  \" CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos. Inc. ( EL.N ) on Wednesday said its quarterly profit fell slightly, but blew past its lowered expectations, as it worked to promote its brands amid consolidation among the department stores where its cosmetics and fragrances are sold. \\n\\n The company, whose brands include Clinique, Aveda and Bobbi Brown, kept its full-year expectations intact despite coming in ahead of its forecast and said that view could be pressured if Lord & Taylor shuts some stores. Estee Lauder also said its board voted to increase the annual dividend on Estee Lauder's common stock by 25 percent to 50 cents per share. Profit was $58.3 million, or 27 cents per share, in the first quarter that ended September 30, compared with $58.5 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations fell to $58 million, or 27 cents per share, from $61.8 million, or 28 cents per share. In August, Estee Lauder forecast first quarter earnings of 15 cents to 20 cents per share from continuing operations, well below Wall Street expectations for 33 cents at the time. Analysts then lowered their forecasts to 19 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Estee Lauder has been pinched as Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, which owns the Macy's and Bloomingdale's chains, closes stores following its acquisition of May Department Stores. Despite that pressure, sales rose 6 percent to $1.59 billion, or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Sales rose in most categories, but fragrance sales slipped 1.3 percent to $289.3 million. The company expects to take advantage of Federated's national Macy's chain, which debuted in September, during the current fiscal year. Estee Lauder, which is based in New York, said it is confident it can meet its full-year forecast for earnings from continuing operations of $2.00 per share to $2.10 per share, including an impact of 8 cents per share from the Federated store closures. It also said sales should still grow 5 percent to 7 percent for the year. Estee Lauder said that full-year results could be lower if Lord & Taylor stores close. The 2007 estimate includes $50 million of sales and earnings of 6 cents per share related to that chain, which Federated just sold to NRDC Equity Partners. For the current second quarter, Estee Lauder forecast sales growth of 6 percent to 8 percent and earnings of 73 cents to 78 cents per share from continuing operations.\",\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - High-yielding emerging market currencies may see further gains in the wake of Wednesday\\'s Federal Reserve statement which gave credence to the view that U.S. interest rates have peaked in this business cycle. \\n\\n The Federal Reserve held its fed funds rate unchanged for the third consecutive month on Wednesday, and issued a balanced statement, warning about inflation, but also noting that the U.S. economy was slowing and that crude oil prices had fallen. \"I\\'m less concerned about any dramatic slowing because we\\'ve seen a U.S. equity market rally, income growth has been okay, and you\\'re not seeing a sharper slowdown in consumer behavior,\" said Stephen Gilmore, emerging market currency strategist at Banque AIG in London.\" As a result financial futures markets now suggest the chances the Fed will raise its fed funds rate to 5.5 percent by January are down to 10 percent from 16 percent on Tuesday. In fact, fed funds futures futures now show a moderate chance the Fed will cut rates as soon as the second quarter next year, a scenario that should spur the flow of capital into higher yielding emerging markets. And the slippage in the U.S. dollar \"reflected a market that was slightly long dollars going into the event on expectations that if there were any changes, they were likely to err on the hawkish side,\" said Alan Ruskin, chief market strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. Rising stock prices in emerging markets, backed by robust foreign equity inflows, should entice investors to seek returns in those countries, lifting their currencies. \"It\\'s not a bad time to be in emerging market currencies,\" Banque AIG\\'s Gilmore added. Emerging market currencies rallied across the board against the dollar after the Fed statement. Latin American and Asian currencies posted sharp gains following the Fed meeting. Both Latin America and Asia, which rely heavily on the United States for exports, would benefit if the U.S. economy slows only gradually. Rebecca Paterson, global currency strategist, at JP Morgan in New York has recommended that investors use the dollar\\'s declines to buy emerging market currencies. \"Part of why the dollar is selling off...is also just selling to get into emerging markets,\" Patterson said. UNCONVINCED ABOUT EMERGING FX GAINS Some analysts, however, remained unconvinced about the current phase of emerging market strength. Bank of America emerging currency strategist Lawrence Goodman said while the Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged for some time, other major central banks such as the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are in a tightening mode. \"Monetary conditions in major central banks will be critical for emerging markets in coming days,\" said Goodman in New York. \"As rate expectations are ratcheted up in G3 currencies (dollar, euro, yen), the prospect of a modest correction in high-yielding emerging market currencies increases,\" he added. Higher bond yields in recent weeks in the United State, the eurozone and Japan could well tempt investors out of lucrative emerging markets, therefore putting downward pressure on their currencies. Other brokerage houses like BNP Paribas, while clearly bullish on emerging markets, were also cautious. In a research note, the bank said \"further gains could start to be more discriminate and benefit only those currencies that have embarked on tighter monetary policies\" and stronger fiscal measures. Analysts say Asian currencies fit that mold. \"There\\'s an inevitability about Asian currency strength that can only be frustrated by actions of local policymakers to stop excessive appreciation,\" wrote Bear Stearns chief currency strategist Steve Barrow in London. Most analysts believe even if the United States does end up raising interest rates one more time, Asia would not be as negatively affected as many of its counterparts, especially given the region\\'s external surpluses. For now, a U.S. rate rise is certainly far from most investors\\' minds. \"For someone who is prepared to take large swings, then high-yielders make sense,\" said Banque AIG\\'s Gilmore.',\n",

       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) on Tuesday posted quarterly profit and revenue ahead of Wall Street estimates and said growth in its technology spending would slow this quarter, lifting its shares by 14 percent. \\n\\n The Web retailer has unnerved investors with narrowing profit margins in recent quarters as it spent heavily on technology and content to improve its site, which offers everything from books and computers to diamonds and lawnmowers, and stay ahead of competitors. But Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said operating profit margins would improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, thanks to a combination of revenue growth and a slower increase in technology investment. \"The company is guiding to a pretty significant improvement in the operating margin declines that they\\'ve experienced over the past couple of quarters,\" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt. \"Amazon shares typically follow operating margins.\" Other analysts were more skeptical about the long term. Pacific Crest analyst Steve Weinstein said improved operating profit margins were to be expected over the holidays, with the surge of gift-giving. He was concerned by accelerated marketing spending. \"While the growth rates for the company are impressive, they seem to have to keep working harder and harder to get that growth,\" Weinstein said. \"It\\'s just not clear to me that margins get better into next year.\" Amazon said third-quarter net income fell to $19 million, or 5 cents per share, from $30 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 24 percent to $2.31 billion from $1.86 billion, helped by a sharp rise in sales of electronics. Wall Street on average had targeted earnings of 3 cents per share on sales of $2.25 billion, based on Reuters Estimates. Amazon, the second-most-popular e-commerce site behind eBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ), has been seen as focusing on revenue growth at the expense of profits. In the process, it has alienated many investors who wonder when its heavy investment will pay off. Third-quarter technology and content spending rose 42 percent to $172 million, a sharp deceleration from a 74 percent rise in the year-ago quarter and a 58 percent rise in the second quarter. Operating profits fell to 1.7 percent of revenue, compared with 3.0 percent a year ago and 2.2 percent the prior quarter. North American sales rose 21 percent to $1.26 billion, while international sales rose 29 percent to $1.05 billion. Worldwide electronics sales rose 43 percent to $699 million, accounting for 30 percent of worldwide net sales, up from 26 percent in the year-ago quarter. Amazon now expects fourth-quarter sales of $3.63 billion to $3.95 billion, while Wall Street on average expected $3.69 billion. Amazon also projected operating earnings of $145 million to $235 million for the fourth quarter, versus the Wall Street target of $178 million. For full year 2006, the company said operating earnings should range between $339 million to $429 million. In July, Amazon had expected a range of $310 million and $440 million. The full-year revenue target was raised to a range of $10.35 billion to $10.68 billion from $10.15 billion to $10.65 billion in July. The stock, which had been down 31 percent in 2006, is valued at 49 times estimated 2007 earnings, or three times that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) at 16, and an average multiple of 15 in the Standard & Poor\\'s Retailing Index .GSPMS. Expectations that Amazon will sharply boost its low margins mean it also trades at a premium to rival Internet stocks such as Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ), eBay and Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ). Amazon shares rose to $38.44 in after-hours trade from a close of $33.63 on Nasdaq.',\n",
       "  \" NEW YORK  (Reuters) - RadioShack Corp. ( RSH.N ) posted a quarterly loss on Wednesday, hit by higher costs and lower wireless sales as the consumer electronics retailer struggles to turn around its business. \\n\\n RadioShack reported a net loss of $16 million, or 12 cents per share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006. That compares with net income of $108.5 million or 75 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company said last year's third-quarter net income was boosted by a non-cash gain of $56.5 million or $0.39 per share due to the reversal of a tax contingency reserve. Total sales in the third quarter fell 11 percent to $1.06 billion. The company said comparable store sales dropped 9.6 percent during the quarter. The company said the earnings reflected a non-cash write-down of $29 million of assets associated with RadioShack's wireless kiosk operations, $18 million in turnaround plan costs, and lower wireless sales. RadioShack is trying to stabilize a business hurt by slumping mobile phone and product sales, and intense competition. It is shutting hundreds of stores and offering more popular, quick-selling merchandise, such as MP3 digital music players and flat-panel televisions. It also installed turnaround veteran Julian Day as chief executive in July and said it will no longer host conference calls when it issues quarterly earnings updates.

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain\\'s BT Group Plc said on Wednesday it had bought Counterpane Internet Security Inc., boosting its capability to advise its corporate customers in their battle against computer hackers. \\n\\n The former UK telecoms monopoly said California-based Counterpane currently monitors 550 networks worldwide for multinational and Fortune 100 customers, and the deal would be earnings enhancing almost immediately with cost synergies. It did not disclose the exact value of the deal, only saying it was in the \"tens of millions of dollars\". An industry source put the value at around $40 million. BT said Counterpane, whose founder and Chief Technology Officer Bruce Schneier is mentioned in Dan Brown\\'s blockbuster novel \"The Da Vinci Code\" as a leading cryptologist, had gross assets of $6.8 million at end-2004 and annual sales of around $20 million. \"While this is not a large transaction from a financial perspective, it is a very strategically important transaction to us,\" President of Strategy for Global Services Maggie McClelland said in a conference call. The group said it was actively considering other similar acquisitions to boost its professional services business, a key business for its fastest-growing division, BT Global Services. BT has been increasingly dependent on this division, which provides networked IT services to clients ranging from food group Unilever to Britain\\'s National Health Service, to offset declining sales in its traditional fixed-line telecoms business. \"The acquisition of Counterpane strengthens BT Global Services\\' capabilities in the important Internet security space and also its U.S. capabilities,\" NCB said in a research note. BT said Counterpane\\'s founder Schneier would continue in his role, as would Chief Executive Paul Stich. BT plans to keep the company as a separate entity for the foreseeable future. The deal follows news on Tuesday that French computer consultancy Capgemini was transferring a large part of its European networking infrastructure services operations to BT in a deal that will see BT engaging around 250 Capgemini staff. Shares in BT were down 0.3 percent at 270-1/2 pence by 0825 GMT, valuing the group at around 22.5 billion pounds. (Additional reporting by  Santosh Menon )',\n",
       "  ' MOSCOW  (Reuters) - U.S.-based International Paper Co. launched a major foray into Russia on Wednesday, signing a letter of intent to form a joint venture with the country\\'s leading forestry firm Ilim Pulp. \\n\\n Under the deal, Memphis-based International Paper would take a 50 percent equity interest in Ilim Holding, into which Ilim Pulp\\'s four pulp and paper mills in Siberia and European Russia are being grouped. The joint venture, valued at about $1.3 billion, would produce 2.5 million tonnes a year of market pulp, uncoated papers and packaging, the companies said. The two sides also plan to invest $1.2 billion over the next five years to boost capacity by 40 percent, or 1 million tonnes a year, and increase output of high-value products. International Paper Chairman and Chief Executive John Faraci said the venture would \"unite the unique capabilities of both companies to enable us to create more value together than we could individually.\" News of the deal appeared well-timed, as President Vladimir Putin used a televised question-and-answer session to call on Russia\\'s forestry industry to invest more in processing and cut exports of logs. RESTRUCTURING DRIVE International Paper\\'s Russian move follows a restructuring drive over the past year, during which it has raised over $6 billion by selling U.S. forestry land with an area the size of Massachusetts. Analysts have praised the U.S. timberland sales as a good move to cash in on rising U.S. property prices. By coming to Russia, International Paper will gain access to vast resources, although poor transport infrastructure is a problem. Ilim Pulp, founded in 1992, says it has Europe\\'s largest resources of timber, with reserves of nearly 8 million cubic metres. It is the continent\\'s fourth-largest producer of market pulp. \"Our joint success would provide Russia with a competitive edge over other emerging markets in attracting needed capital to the industry,\" said Zakhar Smushkin, who is both chairman and a core shareholder of closely held Ilim Pulp. The deal should close in the first quarter of 2007, pending due diligence and regulatory approvals. The venture will not include International Paper\\'s pulp and paper mill in the Russian town of Svetogorsk. Ilim Pulp will, meanwhile, fold its wood-products business into a separate holding company, the companies said. News of the venture came as Putin said the government would hike export duties on timber logs by 2009 and cut tariffs on imports of wood-processing equipment to stimulate the domestic industry. Heavy logging has led to deforestation in areas such as Russia\\'s northwest, close to the Finnish border, while the forestry industry in the remote interior is deeply depressed. Putin told the forestry industry to stop lobbying to protect tax breaks on the export of logs. \"It would be better if you devoted your efforts to securing a reduction in tariffs on imports of technical equipment, creating jobs in Russia, paying taxes and stimulating the development of the machine-building sector in Russia,\" he said.',\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Cigarette maker Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) on Wednesday said it will announce the timetable for its planned spinoff of Kraft Foods Inc. at the end of January, sending its stock higher despite a quarterly earnings report that missed Wall Street expectations. \\n\\n Investors have been anxiously awaiting Altria\\'s announcement about the 88.6 percent of Kraft shares it holds since management first disclosed the plan two years ago. \"Today\\'s announcement brings us a step closer to a fully independent Kraft,\" Louis Camilleri, Altria chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. Altria, parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies, said profit in the third quarter was roughly flat at $2.88 billion, or $1.36 a share, held back by weakness in Spain and Japan. That compared to $2.88 billion, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.39 a share. On that basis, analysts forecast $1.41 a share on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Despite the lackluster earnings report, Altria shares were up $1.51 at $81.33 on Wednesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. But while the stock rallied after the Kraft news, some analysts said investors may be disappointed Altria did not provide details for the spin-off on Wednesday. \"It\\'s like the carrot and the horse. You keep moving the carrot forward and eventually the horse loses interest,\" said Morningstar analyst Gregg Warren. Kraft shares fell 78 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $34.59. Analysts and investors note that when Kraft is spun off, many funds that invest in Altria will need to sell the Kraft shares they receive. ALTRIA REVENUE UP, SHIPMENTS DOWN Altria\\'s third-quarter operating revenue rose 3.7 percent to $25.8 billion. Philip Morris International\\'s operating profit fell 3.8 percent to $2.1 billion and the unit shipped 215.9 billion cigarettes, down 0.5 percent. Shipments fell 12.4 percent in Spain, where the entire cigarette market has been hurt by a ban on smoking in most public places. In Japan, shipments fell 10.4 percent as retailers sold off extra inventory bought ahead of a July 1 industry-wide price increase that resulted from a tax increase. Operating profit at the company\\'s Philip Morris USA unit rose 5.7 percent to $1.3 billion. The unit shipped 47.6 billion cigarettes, a decrease of 0.6 percent. Altria also said it now expects full-year earnings to be $5.48 to $5.53 a share, up from its previous forecast of $5.40 to $5.50, due in part to its part of a gain Kraft will post from the sale of its Minute rice brand. Altria shares are up about 10 percent this year, compared with a 13-percent increase for the Dow Jones industrial average   .DJI . The stock had rallied to an all-time high of $85 earlier this year. But the shares have retreated since a federal judge in New York ruled last month that U.S. smokers who bought \"light\" cigarettes could sue the tobacco industry as one large class on allegations cigarette makers fooled consumers into thinking \"light\" cigarettes were safer than regular smokes.',\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tobacco industry leader Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) on Wednesday posted lower-than-expected earnings due to weakness in international markets, while competitor Reynolds American Inc. ( RAI.N ) beat estimates, helped by market share gains for Camel cigarettes. \\n\\n Altria also said it would announce at the end of January the timing and details of its plan to spinoff the 88.6 percent of Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N shares it holds, sending Altria stock up almost 2 percent. \"Overall, we believe this is very positive news since it is clear the board\\'s priority is to break-up the company and now the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the break-up has finally diminished,\" Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Citigroup Investment Research, said in a research note. Reynolds said its Conwood smokeless tobacco business will add more to earnings than expected in 2006 and raised its profit forecast for the year. Altria, parent of Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International, also raised its forecast, but largely due to an expected gain from the sale of a business by Kraft. Reynolds has cut costs and focused its marketing on Kool and Camel cigarettes, helping drive market share gains for those brands while lifting operating margins. The company also acquired Conwood, the No. 2 smokeless tobacco company. Altria\\'s international operations have been hurt by a smoking ban in most public places in Spain and by industry weakness in the third quarter in Japan Altria shares were up $1.08 cents at $80.90 in midday trading, while Reynolds were up $1.47, or 2.28 percent, at  $65.87.

REYNOLDS BEATS ESTIMATES At Reynolds, the company said profit was $309 million, or $1.05 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $213 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding merger-related charges, earnings were $1.09 a share. Analysts, on average, forecast $1 on that basis, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 1.9 percent to $2.19 billion. The company shipped 26.7 billion cigarettes in the quarter, down 7.4 percent from a year earlier. Reynolds now forecasts earnings of $4.20 to $4.30 a share for the year. The company had previously forecast $4.15 to $4.25 a share, adjusting for a 2-for-1 stock split. As of Tuesday\\'s close, Reynolds shares were up about 32 percent this year, compared with about a 7 percent increase for Altria. Reynolds traded at about 14.8 times 2007 estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of 14.2 for Altria.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) on Wednesday posted third-quarter profit well above Wall Street expectations but issued a disappointing forecast for 2007, sending the planemaker\\'s shares down 3 percent. \\n\\n The Chicago-based company, which is also the No. 2 U.S. defense contractor, is racking up record sales of its commercial jets as rival Airbus flounders, but some investors are concerned that costs are rising on its new 787 Dreamliner. \"Overall, we view this quarter as a slight negative,\" JP Morgan analyst Joseph Nadol said in a research note. \"The results were better than expected, but on the strength of lower-than-expected corporate costs. And rising 787 costs meant that 2007 guidance was raised by less than expected.\" Boeing shares, up about 30 percent over the past 12 months, were down $2.54 at $81.05 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They hit an all-time high of $89.58 in May. Boeing\\'s commercial airplanes unit, which is outselling Airbus ( EAD.PA ) three-to-one so far this year, posted sharply higher revenue, but analysts pointed to higher research and development forecasts, chiefly for spending on the new mid-sized 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 jumbo. Boeing said its revolutionary 787, made mostly of carbon composite and titanium to cut weight and save on fuel costs, was still on target for flight testing next year and entry into service in the summer of 2008. But the cost of the program, which is being closely watched by investors and competitors, has crept up over the past year as the company looks to avoid production delays that have dogged its European rival. \"I would describe what we\\'re doing as pretty aggressive contingency planning,\" Boeing Chief Executive James McNerney said in a conference call, on the subject of higher spending. \"We\\'re at that point in the (787) development program where weight remains a dogged issue. We know what we have to do. Suppliers occasionally need help.\" McNerney said Boeing had moved some 787 production work to  its own Seattle-area facilities but would not say where from. He did not say which suppliers needed help. \"This plane will be done on time and within contractual commitments,\" he added. BEATS STREET Overall, Boeing reported third-quarter profit of $694 million, or 89 cents a share, down from $1 billion, or $1.26 a share, in the year-earlier quarter, which was boosted by some one-time tax and asset-sale gains. That easily beat Wall Street\\'s lowered average earnings forecast of 63 cents per share as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Profit was helped by sharply lower general and administrative costs. Its commercial plane unit reported sales up 45 percent to $6.7 billion, and its defense unit reported sales rose 4 percent to $7.8 billion, helped by growth in its military plane programs. Boeing Capital -- which organizes financing for customers -- posted sales up 32 percent to $304 million. Total revenue rose 19 percent to $14.7 billion, boosted by higher plane deliveries, but missed analysts\\' average forecast of $14.99 billion. On the back of booming plane sales, Boeing raised its 2007 earnings forecast to a range of $4.45 to $4.65 per share, up from a previous forecast of $4.25 to $4.45. But that fell short of analysts\\' average forecast of $4.69. Third-quarter profit was reduced by 22 cents a share by a charge for closing Connexion, its money-losing in-flight high-speed broadband communications service. As a result of the charge, Boeing nudged down the top end of its full-year 2006 earnings forecast by 5 cents a share. The new range is $2.40 to $2.50 per share. Wall Street expects, on average, $2.35. STRONG BACKLOG Boeing said the backlog of work on its order books rose 12 percent from a year ago to a record $229 billion, boosted by strong commercial plane sales. \"They now have five years\\' worth of production for commercial airplanes (backlog),\" said Paul Nisbet at aerospace specialists JSA Research. \"If it stays that way, no one will complain.\" Boeing has taken firm orders for 753 commercial planes so far this year, on track to rival last year\\'s record of 1,002. The company raised its R&D spending forecast for the second successive quarter to tackle 787 problems and fund more work on its new 747-8 jumbo. It now expects to spend $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion on R&D across the company this year, and between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion in 2007.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - FPL Group Inc. FPL.N and Constellation Energy CEG.N on Wednesday scrapped a $12.5 billion merger deal over uncertainty of regulatory and judicial approvals, the second potential tie-up among large power companies to fail this year. \\n\\n The move, which comes a month after Exelon Corp. ( EXC.N ) canceled its planned purchase of Public Service Enterprise Group ( PEG.N ) over to regulatory hurdles, follows the repeal of a long-standing federal law limiting mergers. But state regulators have increased scrutiny of such deals as utility rates rise. The state regulatory step-up could have a chilling effect on future utility deals and may push companies to consider spinning off their regulated businesses, as PSEG said it might do, bankers said. \"I think a number of states have done a spectacularly effective job ensuring that merger transactions will be chilled or impeded for some time,\" said George Bilicic, head power and energy investment banker at Lazard Ltd. ( LAZ.N ). The 10-month-old FPL-Constellation deal had been in trouble since the spring, particularly in Maryland, and the companies had said several times that they might not be able to complete it. In May, they stopped integration work and Constellation continued to pursue other strategic plans, such as the sale of its gas generation plants for $1.64 billion to Tenaska Power Fund LP. RATEPAYERS REVOLT FPL was caught up in politics in Maryland over Constellation\\'s Baltimore Gas & Electric\\'s plans to raise electricity rates, which have since been scaled back. \"As we considered the situation in Maryland, we determined the risks and uncertainties were too significant to overcome,\" Constellation Chief Executive Mayo Shattuck said in a statement. \"I think the timing was poor,\" said energy analyst Daniele Seitz of Dahlman Rose. \"Going to market-based rates is a big challenge in itself, but trying to do that along with the merger was obviously difficult.\" FPL, the parent of Florida Power and Light utility, announced plans to acquire Constellation in December 2005, a move aimed at creating a top-tier nuclear generator and as part of broader expansion plans away from Florida. The all-stock deal, which at the time was worth about $11 billion, was part of a series of large announcements marking consolidation in the power sector. Of those, only Duke Energy Corp.\\'s ( DUK.N ) purchase of Cinergy has closed. Still outstanding is National Grid Plc\\'s ( NG.L ) plan to buy KeySpan Corp. KSE.N in the U.S. Northeast. LAW REPEALED The increased difficulty in closing deals has come as power shifted away from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, which had limited utility mergers since 1935. That repeal, effective in February, was expected to ease the abilities of companies to merge. But it may have pushed some state regulatory commissions to take a closer look at such deals. Now experts say utilities might look to build more profitable unregulated divisions and spin off the regulated units. Those moves, however, would also likely to draw sharp regulator scrutiny. Sharp rises in electricity prices, which vary dramatically by state, have been one of the key drivers of the state scrutiny, experts said. \"Electricity pricing is the paramount issue. We are in an environment where a merger must have demonstrable benefits for rate payers,\" said Curt Launer, a managing director at boutique firm Sagent Advisors. \"The balance of power...has shifted more toward state regulation.\" The companies\\' shares have both risen since the deal was announced, and on Wednesday FPL was up $1.52, or 3.1 percent, at $49.69 by mid-afternoon, while Constellation fell 81 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.75, both on the New York Stock Exchange.',\n",

Net income at the Indianapolis-based company, the second major U.S. health insurer to report earnings this quarter after UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ), rose to $811 million, or $1.29 per share. That compared to $641 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Earnings were $1.24 per share, excluding a 4 cent tax benefit and net realized investment gains of 1 cent. That was a penny ahead of the $1.23 per share expected by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Medical enrollment rose by 5.2 million members to 34.2 million from a year ago, including about 4.8 million members added through its $6.5 billion purchase of rival WellChoice Inc. in December. Bank of America analyst Joseph France said in a research note that enrollment grew by 27,000 from the second quarter -- \"really disappointing for a company that enrolls business year-round.\" WellPoint projected medical enrollment of about 34.3 million members at year end, down from the 34.5 million it forecast in July. The company\\'s sales, general and administrative expense ratio was 15.5 percent in the quarter, down from 16.8 percent in the 2005 quarter. WellPoint said the improvement stemmed from controlling spending and various efficiencies, including those gained by integrating acquisitions. WellPoint expects to lower that SG&A ratio by as much as 2 percentage points over the next three to five years, Chief Financial Officer David Colby told analysts on a conference call. The company\\'s benefit expense ratio -- a key barometer that measures medical costs as a percentage of premium dollars -- worsened by a tenth of a percentage point to 81.3 percent from the second quarter and by 1.8 percentage points from a year ago. WellPoint said the worsening of the ratio -- which came in below several analysts\\' expectations -- resulted mainly from adding the New York state prescription drug contract, which has a higher-than-average benefit expense ratio, and increased medical expenses for a federal employee contract. CIBC analyst Carl McDonald said in a research note the ratio came in \"a touch higher than expected, but was offset by a better SG&A ratio.\" Revenue rose 29 percent to $14.4 billion. WellPoint said it raised its full-year forecast to $4.81 per share. Analysts expected $4.76. For 2007, the company said it expects to achieve its targeted 15 percent growth in net income per share. \"Looking ahead to 2007, we anticipate another year of robust growth in our National Accounts business, along with further expansion of our Medicaid membership base following our recent contract awards,\" Chief Executive Larry Glasscock said in a statement. WellPoint shares have fallen more than 4 percent this year, a smaller drop than those of rivals UnitedHealth and Aetna Inc. ( AET.N ), which reports earnings on Thursday. WellPoint shares fell $2.67, or 3.4 percent, to $75.95 on the New York Stock Exchange, where they earlier dropped to $75.32. Shares of UnitedHealth and Aetna were off more than 2 percent.',\n",

Aetna shares rose as much as $3.85, or 10 percent, to $42.38 in opening trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

Net income at the Hartford, Connecticut-based company rose to $476 million, or 85 cents per share, from $373 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding gains of 6 cents per share from the reversal of reserves from prior periods and 1 cent per share from net capital investment, earnings were 78 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 72 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Aetna\\'s full-service health care plans had 15.38 million members, up about 730,000 from a year earlier but down about 24,000 from the second quarter. For its commercial business, Aetna\\'s medical cost ratio -- a key barometer that measures medical costs as a percentage of premium dollars -- improved 2.1 percentage points from the second quarter to 79.3 percent. \"We are very pleased to see that our commercial risk medical cost ratio improved ... from the second quarter level and our medical cost trend moderated as well,\" Chief Executive Ron Williams said in a statement. Revenue rose 11 percent to $6.3 billion. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 18.4 percent from 19.3 percent a year earlier. Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said all segments of the company, including healthcare, were above his estimates. The company raised its full-year operating earnings forecast to $2.83 per share from its prior view of $2.77 to $2.79. Analysts had expected $2.76. For 2007, it gave a preliminary forecast of operating earnings of $3.26 per share.

The Waltham, Massachusetts, company said net profit increased to $321 million, or 71 cents per share, from $228 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations was 72 cents per share, which beat Wall Street's average forecast of 64 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Results were helped by lower pension costs of $93 million in the quarter, down from $117 million a year ago. Revenue rose 7 percent to $5.69 billion, short of analysts' average forecast of $5.78 billion. Based on its better-than-expected performance, Raytheon raised its full-year earnings forecast 10 cents per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. Wall Street is expecting $2.72 per share, on average. For 2007, Raytheon made its first earnings forecast of $2.95 to $3.05 per share. Analysts are expecting $3.09 per share, on average. The company forecast revenue of $24.6 billion to $25.1 billion for 2007. Analysts are expecting $24.68 billion, on average. Third-quarter results were boosted by higher sales at its integrated defense unit, which rose 12 percent to $1.03 billion, and its missile systems unit, which posted sales 8 percent higher at $1.08 billion. Its network centric systems unit, which makes air traffic control, navigation and surveillance gear, posted sales up 6 percent at $879 million. Its space and airborne systems unit posted sales 6 percent higher at $1.07 billion, while its technical services unit reported sales rose 6 percent to $509 million. Raytheon's aircraft unit, which in July it said it was looking to sell, posted sales 18 percent higher at $758 million, on the back of a global surge in business jet purchases. It delivered 113 jets to customers in the quarter, up from 80 in the year-ago quarter. The unit, which makes jets under the Hawker and Beechcraft names, took orders for 104 new planes in the quarter, up from 82 in the same quarter last year.

       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on Wednesday posted operating earnings at the high end of Wall Street expectations, but wary investors sent the stock down more than 4 percent on expectations that the easiest part of the automaker\\'s turnaround was nearing an end. \\n\\n Improved results had been largely anticipated from GM, which lost $10.6 billion in 2005, and analysts said investor attention was shifting to whether GM would succeed in moving beyond cost-cutting as new products began hitting showrooms. \"It\\'s just not as much of a positive surprise in North America and Europe as we would have hoped for,\" Morgan Keegan analyst Pete Hastings said of GM\\'s results. GM, which is slashing more than 34,000 jobs and closing 12 plants, said it was on track to cut $9 billion in operating costs this year. \"They are still in a little bit of a honeymoon as far as cost-cutting goes,\" Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan said. GM posted a narrower net loss of $115 million, or 20 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.7 billion, or $2.94 per share a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $48.8 billion. Excluding $644 million in charges for a write-down of the value of its GMAC financial arm, the reorganization of auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK and other items, GM posted operating earnings of 93 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had expected an adjusted profit of 45 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. UNDER PRESSURE The results come at a time when Chief Executive Rick Wagoner is under pressure to show progress in the company\\'s turnaround. GM\\'s global sales fell 2.5 percent in the first nine months of 2006, as it lost market share to Japan\\'s Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ). Toyota is expected to overtake GM as the world\\'s largest automaker within a year based on current sales trends. \"The turnaround is obviously a multistage process,\" Tynan said. \"First come the cost cuts; but at some point you have to dig in and put some meat on the bones. Which means they have to look at the top line, look at making better products, look at stabilizing market share.\" GM\\'s third-quarter North American market share slipped to 24 percent from 25 percent a year earlier. GM executives are under pressure as they brace for a possible proxy fight with billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, the automaker\\'s largest individual shareholder. Kerkorian\\'s financial adviser Jerry York -- who quit the automaker\\'s board earlier this month, after GM turned down the possibility of a three-way alliance with Japan\\'s Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) and France\\'s Renault SA ( RENA.PA ) -- has flagged GM\\'s negative cash flow as an area of concern. GM said its automotive cash totaled $20.4 billion at September 30, down from $22.9 billion at June 30. That included the liquid assets of a trust fund for employee health care. Reversing cash burn is an \"important priority\" for GM, Henderson said. \"We need to get that turned around.\" DELPHI DEAL NEAR? GM narrowed the range of its estimated exposure for benefit guarantees to bankrupt Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK to between $6 billion and $7.5 billion, from a previous estimate of $5.5 billion to $12 billion -- indicating a deal was drawing closer. GM, which spun off Delphi in 1999, has been in talks with the parts supplier and its unions over a cost-saving labor deal that would allow Delphi to emerge from bankruptcy. A deal between the United Auto Workers union, Delphi and GM would avert a strike that could otherwise shut down GM\\'s production and force it to burn through billions of dollars a week. \"We continue to believe Delphi will (reach a deal) without a labor disruption, though we also believe this is the strong consensus view at this point,\" Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold wrote in a research note. Nesvold said that a Delphi deal could be a trigger for investors to take profits on GM\\'s rally. In another closely watched matter, GM said it was on track to close its $14 billion sale of a 51 percent stake in GMAC in the fourth quarter, earlier than some analysts had expected. GM shares, which reached a 52-week high on Tuesday, fell $1.76, or 4.9 percent, to $34.43 in late Wednesday afternoon trade. GM\\'s forward price-to-earnings ratio, based on 2007 estimates, was 7.6 compared with a ratio of about 18 for the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index. GM typically trades at a discount of up to 50 percent to the broad market because of the cyclical nature of the auto industry. The stock remains up almost 78 percent since the start of the year.

       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner has been riding high with Wall Street this year: GM stock is up almost 80 percent and talk of bankruptcy has receded after billions of dollars in cost cuts. \\n\\n But analysts caution that the automaker\\'s recovery is still stalled by one important measure: cash burn. \"Weak cash flow outlook keeps us skeptical (a) turnaround is underway,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry said on Thursday, a day after GM, which lost $10.6 billion in 2005, posted an operating profit at the high end of Wall Street expectations. Excluding one-time items, GM posted an operating profit of 93 cents per share, compared with an average Wall Street forecast of 45 cents per share. \"GM\\'s results tell a very different story if viewed from the income statement versus the cash flow statement,\" Barry said. GM burned $3.8 billion of cash in the third quarter, compared with $2.3 billion a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson said the bulk of the negative cash flow was due to a 72-hour sale on 2006 models that the  automaker offered over in late June and early July. Henderson, who said GM would not generate any cash through the remainder of the year, called reversing the automaker\\'s cash burn an \"important priority.\" GM shares, which touched a 52-week high the day before its results, have slipped 5 percent in the two days since with investor attention shifting to whether GM will succeed in moving beyond cost-cutting to drive sales gains. \"GM\\'s future stock price performance will be largely tied to its cash flow improvement,\" Calyon Securities analyst Joseph Amaturo said. Merrill Lynch cut its rating on GM shares to \"sell\" from \"buy,\" becoming the fifth brokerage to lower its rating following GM\\'s earnings report, as tracked by Reuters Estimates. Goldman\\'s Barry said he expects GM\\'s cash flow from automotive operations to be negative $5.5 billion in 2006, and negative $2.3 billion in 2007. GM\\'s Henderson said that of the $6 billion savings on structural costs forecast for this year, only $2.5 billion would be cash. \"We\\'re still of the view that the best cost cutting news is behind GM,\" Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold said. GM, which will save $1 billion in annual healthcare costs through a deal it reached with its union, is slashing more than 30,000 jobs. As part of its cost-cutting efforts, the automaker is also closing 12 plants. \"Our sense is that as these issues fade into history or generate fewer headlines, the stock\\'s floor could drift downward,\" Nesvold said.',\n",
       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ) posted a smaller-than-expected 4.9 percent drop in quarterly operating profit on Thursday as an aging product line hit global sales, and it kept its full-year forecasts, helped by a softer yen. \\n\\n Nissan, 44 percent-owned by Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), is expected to be Japan\\'s only leading auto maker to post lower second-quarter earnings. On Wednesday, rival Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) said its operating profit jumped 19 percent as sales powered ahead in North America. Top-ranked Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) reports its results on November 7. After straining to meet a 3.6 million vehicle global sales target for the 12 months through September 2005, Nissan has paid with a year-long sales slump, exacerbated by a paucity of new models. Its sole first-half launch was a commercial truck. July-September operating profit fell to 195.3 billion yen ($1.65 billion), beating an average estimate of 189.15 billion yen in a survey of five brokerages by Reuters Estimates. Net profit spiked up 31 percent to 164 billion yen, helped by gains from selling shares in Nissan Diesel Motor Co. 7210.T to Volvo AB ( VOLVb.ST ), as well as favorable pension and tax benefits. Revenue fell 0.9 percent to 2.32 trillion yen. A year ago, Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn predicted the effect of a final sprint toward the sales goal would be short-lived, but has since called for a reversal only in the current half-year, with Nissan planning to flood the global market with nine all-new models. \"Nowhere in the foreseeable future will we have another low point in our product cycles such as we have experienced over the past 12 months,\" he told a news conference. \"In the second half, and into 2007, you will see a return to the intense product launch activity that has fueled Nissan\\'s profitable growth in the past.\" Nissan plans to launch 11 new products next business year, including a compact crossover called Rogue in the United States and the iconic GT-R sports car, to be sold globally. GHOSN DEFENDS RESULTS Still, some market watchers remain bearish, citing Nissan\\'s sales slide in key regions. \"It looks like the company is losing momentum,\" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. \"Ghosn has pushed for reforms and Nissan has turned profitable. But the company now appears to be struggling in trying to move on to the next stage,\" he added. Responding to such skepticism, Ghosn, credited for saving Nissan from bankruptcy, defended Nissan\\'s results and stressed that with its full-year forecasts intact, the auto maker was on its way to record a seventh straight year of record profits. He added that U.S. sales were on track to grow by a double-digit percentage in October. \"Many auto makers would do anything to have 7.7 operating profit margin -- not at the low end of their product cycle, but even at the top of their product cycle,\" he said, referring to Nissan\\'s margin for the April-September half year. \"We are at 7.7 percent, very far from our potential. If that is the low end, you can imagine what the top is going to be.\" Nissan, which also makes the Infiniti line of premium cars, is predicting an operating profit of 880 billion yen and net profit of 523 billion yen for the year to end-March -- both up about 1 percent from 2005/06. The forecasts were set against an assumed dollar rate of 110 yen and euro rate of 135 yen. Nissan did not officially change its currency assumptions or its sales volume forecasts. Nissan\\'s global output has fallen every month so far this year, and it risks being overtaken by Honda as Japan\\'s second-biggest auto maker. Data this week showed Nissan\\'s April-September output fell 11.9 percent to 1.52 million units, well behind Honda\\'s 1.79 million units. Nissan shares gained 5.8 percent in July-September, slightly underperforming a 6.9 percent rise in the transport sector subindex .ITEQP.T.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ( BMY.N ) on Thursday said third-quarter earnings plunged as sales of the anti-clotting drug Plavix were hurt by a cheaper generic, but the company raised its full-year profit outlook due to cost savings and lower taxes. \\n\\n \"Bristol\\'s results were superficially better than expected and they did raise their guidance for the year, but the real issue is how well the company will do in 2007 and they didn\\'t give any more clarity on that,\" said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan. Some analysts expressed concern about future Plavix sales, upcoming fourth-quarter results and 2007 prospects. New York-based Bristol earned $338 million, or 17 cents per share, from continuing operations, compared with $964 million, or 49 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding special items, the company earned 22 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 20 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales fell 13 percent to $4.15 billion -- a bit shy of Wall Street forecasts of $4.18 billion -- as Plavix was mauled by competition from the early August introduction of the cheaper generic by privately held Canadian drug maker Apotex Inc. A deal between Bristol-Myers and Apotex to delay the generic for years fell apart and is now under criminal investigation by the U.S. government for possible antitrust violations. The probe has been widened to review whether the deal violated federal securities laws, Bristol-Myers said on Thursday. U.S. sales of Plavix plunged 43 percent to $474 million, but would have fallen far more if the generic had been available for the entire quarter. Bristol-Myers secured a federal court injunction on August 31 that prevents Apotex from selling any more of its product in the United States. But Plavix sales continue to suffer as huge supplies of the generic already delivered by Apotex remain on the market. \"It is unclear how much inventory is in the hands of privately-held distributors,\" Merrill Lynch analyst David Risinger said in a research report. Bristol-Myers said, however, that it expects supplies of the generic to dry up in the first quarter. Meanwhile, it expects \"some\" sales of Plavix in the fourth quarter, but did not provide a forecast. Plavix, used to prevent blood clots that can trigger heart attacks, was the world\\'s second-biggest medicine, with global annual sales of $6 billion before the generic arrived. Quarterly company results were helped by an 18 percent pullback in spending on advertising and product promotion, following the recent divestiture of the company\\'s U.S. and Canadian consumer medicines business. The company boosted its full-year profit forecast to between $1.02 and $1.07 per share from its earlier prediction of no less than 95 cents per share. Even so, the new forecast represents a decline of at least 25 percent from last year\\'s results. Global revenue from Plavix, which the company sells in partnership with Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ), fell 36 percent in the quarter to $630 million. Deutsche Bank\\'s Ryan said Plavix sales, although battered, were better than she expected, and that sales of most other company medicines were in line with her forecasts. Global sales of hypertension drug Avapro, also sold with Sanofi-Aventis, rose 10 percent to $277 million. Revenue from schizophrenia treatment Abilify jumped 20 percent to $313 million. Reyataz, a once-daily protease inhibitor against HIV whose use expanded sharply outside the United States, rose 32 percent to $233 million. Sales of Erbitux, marketed in partnership with ImClone Systems Inc. IMCL.O for colon cancer and head and neck cancer, jumped 64 percent to $175 million.

       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - IT consultancy Capgemini ( CAPP.PA ) is buying technology services group Kanbay International KBAY.O for $1.25 billion to accelerate its growth in India and bolster its position in finance consulting and in North America. \\n\\n Capgemini, Europe\\'s largest IT consultancy, said on Thursday that the acquisition of U.S.-listed Kanbay would boost its earnings and margins. \"With this deal we will accelerate our long-term (margin recovery) plan,\" Chief Executive Paul Hermelin told a conference call. \"The market banks on a 2008 (operating) margin. We will top that. We then want to lift our margin above 10 percent while limiting the group\\'s cyclical exposure.\" Capgemini also unveiled a forecast-beating 13.5-percent rise in third-quarter sales on Thursday but its shares trailed in negative territory after initially rising. By 0903 GMT, the stock was down 1.3 percent at 43.47 euros, underperforming the DJ Stoxx European technology sector .SX8P. Analysts said the deal made sound strategic sense but looked expensive although it was not out of step with recent deals in India. The purchase of a company focused on financial services in the United States at a time when the U.S. economy could be slowing also worried some investors. Several analysts also noted that part of the acquisition could be funded through raising 500 million euros in equity, which would somewhat limit the accretive potential of the deal. Capgemini had been on the lookout for a large deal to bolster its growth in India, a country which offers low-cost, skilled professionals, under a plan to boost the margin of its outsourcing business and of its North American operations. It recently bought a 51-percent stake in business process outsourcing (BPO) unit Unilever India Shares Services Ltd. EXPENSIVE DEAL? Hermelin told French radio Europe 1 he started negotiating with Kanbay, which counts banking giant HSBC has a key client, in January. Capgemini is to pay $29 per share in cash, representing a premium of 15.9 percent to Kanbay\\'s closing share price on October 25. Kanbay has a market capitalization of $975 million. Several analysts said that based on consensus estimates, the deal valued Kanbay at 2.5 times 2007 revenue and 27 times earnings. \"It\\'s an expensive company but it\\'s a company which is doing well,\" Hermelin told Europe 1, saying Kanbay\\'s revenue was growing by some 30 percent a year. Kanbay achieved an operating margin of 13.5 percent in the first-half 2006. The acquisition would boost its earnings per share (EPS) by more than 5 percent in 2007 and 10 percent in 2008 and triple Capgemini\\'s workforce in India to some 12,000 people. India would become the group\\'s second-largest country, accounting for 16 percent of total headcount. \"The deal represents 17 percent of Cap\\'s market capitalization, would add 5 percent to sales at current margins of slightly above 10 percent,\" Societe Generale analysts said in a note. The French-based company, which had a net cash chest of some 800 million euros at end-June, said it could fully finance the Kanbay deal with its cash resources. But it added it would not rule out raising up to 500 million euros in equity to fund further possible acquisitions. \"The deal has some obvious positives but we are concerned about the funding mechanism and have some concerns on the potential 500 million euros overhang,\" Deutsche Bank analysts in a research note. \"In short, we need to get comfortable that we are not seeing a repeat of the type of deals we saw on the last cycle,\" they said. The ill-timed acquisition of Ernst & Young consulting business in the United States at the peak of the tech bubble in 2000 pushed Capgemini into a long period of underperformance from which it emerged last year through drastic restructuring. With revenue of over $400 million euros, Nasdaq-listed Kanbay Inc. is headquartered in Chicago. It has offices in North America and India and employs 6,900 people worldwide, including 5,000 in India.',\n",

Dow shares were also helped by the announcement that its board had approved a $2 billion share buyback program to begin once its current buyback plan ends, analysts said. Midland, Michigan,-based Dow said it benefited from an average 11 percent increase in selling prices for its products, which lifted margins despite an increase of nearly $750 million in raw materials and energy costs. However, analysts noted Dow\\'s earnings gains were centered in base chemical operations rather than its performance plastics and chemicals operations, and that key products such at ethylene had shown price decreases recently.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept its benchmark interest rate steady for a third meeting in a row, predicting moderate economic growth ahead with some reason to expect easing price pressures. \\n\\n The statement from the Fed\\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee seemed to imply U.S. central bank policy-makers felt most of a slowdown stemming from a weak housing sector was past and that the economic expansion was on a solid footing. \"The economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace,\" the Fed said in five paragraphs announcing it was keeping its overnight federal funds rate target at 5.25 percent, the level reached in June after 17 straight increases since mid-2004. The Fed said core inflation rates had been \\'elevated\\' but thought this should ease because there was less impact from higher energy prices, inflation expectations were contained, and prior rate rises had put a restraint on spending. Only Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker, who has been pressing for higher borrowing costs, disagreed. He voted against the majority for a third straight time, the longest string of dissents since former Cleveland Fed President Jerry Jordan did so four times in 1998. The policy-makers took no options off the table, leaving room to either raise or lower rates by saying \"some inflation risks remain\". They also said they will monitor data to judge prospects for both inflation and growth. A Reuters poll of 17 primary dealers -- big Wall Street firms that deal directly with the Fed -- found only one expects the Fed to raise rates at its next meeting on December 12. Eleven of the 17 felt the next rate move would be a cut, while four anticipated a rate rise. That fit with most perceptions immediately after Wednesday\\'s announcement. \"There\\'s nothing here changing the view ... that the Fed\\'s inclination is to stand pat for some time but with a slight bias toward tightening if inflation gains hold,\" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist with RBS Greenwich Capital in New York. \"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these (inflation) risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth,\" the FOMC said in its statement, which closely mirrored the one accompanying its last rate announcement on September 20. The statement seemed to reassure investors, despite being little changed from the previous one. In futures trading, the chances the Fed will lift rates another quarter percentage point by January dropped to 10 percent from 16 Tuesday. Bond prices rallied in relief that the Fed had not struck a more hawkish tone on inflation as many market observers had suggested was possible. Two-year U.S. Treasury notes US2YT=RR, which respond closely to expectations for Fed interest rate moves, traded up 3/32 in price to yield 4.85 percent, versus 4.88 percent just before the Fed announcement and 4.92 percent on Tuesday. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR rose 14/32 for a yield of 4.77 percent, versus 4.81 percent just before the announcement and 4.83 percent late on Tuesday. \"The Fed remains committed to keeping inflationary pressures contained,\" said Kevin Flanagan, a strategist for global wealth management with Morgan Stanley in Purchase, N.Y. \"You don\\'t get a sense of urgency at this point ... that the Fed needs to take that next step and raise rates,\" he added. Stock prices closed modestly higher, influenced more by corporate earnings reports than by the widely anticipated Fed decision. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 6.80 points, to close at a record 12,134.68. There were new signs of economic cooling even before the Fed wrapped up its two-day meeting. A realtors\\' group reported U.S. sales of existing homes fell for a sixth straight month in September and median prices were down from a year ago. But price pressures have stayed high despite some economic slowing and it is evident that the Fed remains wary. The core U.S. consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the first nine months of this year, well above the 2.2 percent posted for all of 2005 and outside the generally perceived 1 percent to 2 percent \"comfort zone\" for Fed policy-makers. The latest meeting was a two-day one to allow discussion on improving communications with the public, but the statement said nothing about what changes might be made or when.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Thursday that both private investors and central banks were shifting away from the U.S. dollar and toward the euro. \\n\\n \"We\\'re beginning to see some move from the dollar to the euro, both from the private sector ... but also from monetary authorities and central banks,\" Greenspan told a conference sponsored by the Commercial Finance Association. His comments pushed the dollar down, a sign that Greenspan, who retired from the U.S. central bank in January, still holds some sway in financial markets. As he had done repeatedly when he led the central bank, Greenspan said it was imperative for the United States to resist protectionist pressures that could make an unwinding of the large U.S. current account trade gap economically painful. \"We\\'ll get to the point at some point that willingness to finance it will slow, and if you can\\'t finance it, it won\\'t happen,\" Greenspan said of the broad trade measure. He said, however, that if the economy remained flexible, the adjustment \"should have very little effect on production and capacity.\" Greenspan warned, however, that if the United States threw up barriers to isolate itself from the pressures of globalization, \"the adjustment process could be a little bit more problematic.\"',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. homes rose unexpectedly last month as prices posted the biggest drop in nearly 36 years, while orders for durable goods aside from aircraft gained slightly, according to reports on Thursday pointing to a modest pace of economic growth. \\n\\n New single-family home sales increased 5.3 percent to an annualized rate of 1.075 million units in September, the Commerce Department said. It was the second straight monthly gain, but the increase reflected a greater willingness by sellers to slash prices. The department said the median price for a new home was down 9.7 percent from $240,400 a year earlier, the biggest year-on-year price drop since December 1970. At the same time, a slight rise in orders for long-lasting manufactured goods outside the volatile transportation sector appeared to offer some backing to the inflation-wary Federal Reserve\\'s projection of moderate economic growth. Analysts said a drop in unsold homes on the market also offered an early sign the housing sector was stabilizing after a big slump, easing concerns it could drag the economy lower. \"It is hard to say but it looks like we are in for the soft (economic) landing,\" said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist at Societe Generale in New York. \"It is telling me that the worst is over for housing.\" Stocks rose as markets saw the data supporting the Fed\\'s growth forecast and suggesting the central bank would likely hold benchmark interest rates steady for some time. Treasury debt security prices also rose. The dollar hit a three-week low against the euro after the report on durable goods orders. A report earlier this week showing sales of existing homes had fallen for the sixth month in a row had sparked fears that a rapid cooling of housing markets might substantially dent growth. GREENSPAN: OUTLOOK \\'REASONABLY GOOD\\' Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Thursday the U.S. economy was pulling away from a sharp housing-sector downturn and that the outlook for growth was \"reasonably good.\" But, he noted in a speech delivered before the government released the home sales figures, that the sector\\'s woes were \"not over.\" \"Most of the negatives in housing are probably behind us,\" Greenspan said at a Washington conference. \"The fourth quarter should be reasonably good, certainly better than the third quarter.\" While the pace of new home sales picked up in September, it was still off 14.2 percent from year-ago levels -- a sign of how far the once high-flying market has fallen. Still, the supply of homes available for sale at September\\'s sales pace fell to 6.4 months\\' worth from 6.8 months in August, as the number of homes on the market fell 1.9 percent to 557,000. \"Between the starts and the aggressive pricing on sales they are clearing inventories in a very rapid fashion,\" said Societe Generale\\'s Gallagher. AIRCRAFT ORDERS SURGE The department said orders for durable goods -- items meant to last three or more years -- leaped 7.8 percent in September, the biggest jump since June 2000, on a rush of civilian aircraft orders. Demand for non-defense aircraft and parts rose 183.2 percent, the biggest gain since July 2002. While the overall increase in orders was much greater than economists had expected, orders were up a smaller-than-forecast 0.1 percent when transportation orders were stripped out. \"Outside of the volatile aircraft orders, manufacturing is still subdued and that\\'s consistent with an economy that\\'s growing moderately,\" said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. Offering an upbeat sign on capital spending plans, orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for business spending, rose a larger-than-expected 1.1 percent. A separate report from the Labor Department showed the number of workers applying for jobless benefits rose by 8,000 last week to 308,000, in line with expectations and still pointing to a relatively healthy job market.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) said on Thursday earnings rose 6 percent to $10.5 billion, the second-largest quarterly operating profit ever by a U.S. company, boosted by robust oil production, as crude prices hovered near record levels. \\n\\n The better-than-expected third-quarter profit pushed the company\\'s Big Board shares to an all-time high of $72.33 on Thursday morning, before they closed at $71.62, a 0.9 percent increase. U.S. oil prices hit a record high of $78.40 a barrel early in the quarter and spent much of the period above $70, before retreating to around $60 as the summer driving season ended and geopolitical tensions eased. U.S. crude is currently trading at around $61 a barrel. Production at the world\\'s largest public company rose about 7 percent to about 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. \"Anything over 3 percent (production growth) is good, and anything over 5 percent is outstanding,\" said Gene Pisasale, senior energy analyst at Mercantile Trust. \"For a company like Exxon to perform at that level is really superb.\" Net income for the third quarter rose to $10.49 billion, or $1.77 a share, from $9.92 billion, or $1.58 a share, a year before. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of $1.59 a share in the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. The profit came in slightly behind the record Exxon posted in the fourth quarter of 2005 and edged out the company\\'s second-quarter earnings. Exxon\\'s earnings per share grew at a faster rate than the company\\'s net profit due to its aggressive share buy-back program. BOOST FROM CRUDE, NATURAL GAS PRICES Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said in a statement that earnings rose on higher realized prices for crude oil and natural gas, as well as improved marketing and chemical margins. Those gains were partly offset by lower refining margins, he said. Exxon\\'s worldwide crude sales realizations were $65.14 per barrel, up $7.12 from the third quarter of 2005. Quarterly revenue dipped to $99.59 billion from $100.72 billion a year before. The huge earnings were a red flag for critics of the company, who charge that Exxon was benefiting at the expense of American consumers. \"It seems like almost every quarter Exxon Mobil and the other big oil companies are shattering all previous profit records,\" Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a statement. \"These companies are doing so not because they\\'re creating any new product or being innovative, but because they control the supply of foreign oil that feeds America\\'s addiction.\" Exxon said earnings excluding special items at its exploration and production operations rose about 13 percent to $6.49 billion. Earnings from the company\\'s refining and marketing operations rose about 29 percent to $2.74 billion, as stronger marketing margins offset weak refining margins. The company said it still expects capital spending of about $20 billion in 2006. Other oil majors also announced surging quarterly earnings this week. Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) said its underlying profit rose 21 percent and BP Plc ( BP.L ) announced a 58 percent rise, helped by asset sales. Earnings rose slightly at ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) as production problems restrained the company\\'s earnings growth. But the pullback of oil prices from sky-high levels has led many investors and analysts to speculate that the days of record oil company profits are nearing their end. Howard Weill energy analyst Gene Gillespie said analysts expects earnings from the oil industry to drop about 10 percent in the fourth quarter. \"Exxon isn\\'t immune from what\\'s going on in the industry,\" Gillespie said. \"If commodity prices continue to rise, they\\'ll grow. If they don\\'t, they won\\'t.\" Shares of Exxon Mobil are up more than 27 percent since the beginning of the year, ahead of the Chicago Board Options Exchange\\'s oil index .OIX, which is up about 19 percent in the same period.',\n",
       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell beat forecasts with a 21 percent rise in underlying third-quarter profit thanks to high oil prices, but the oil major\\'s headline earnings fell as the corresponding period last year benefited from gains on asset sales. \\n\\n The results raised investor hopes that the Anglo-Dutch company has turned the corner after two tough years, and pushed its London-listed A shares up 3.3 percent to 1,848 pence by 0942 GMT, outperforming a 0.7 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European oil and gas sector index. The rise pushed Shell\\'s market capitalization to $229 billion, displacing BP Plc as the world\\'s second-largest fully publicly quoted oil company by market value. Shell said on Thursday that third-quarter current cost of supply (CCS) net profit, which strips out changes in the value of inventories, was $6.9 billion. This was down 4 percent on the same period of 2005 when divestment gains added $1.7 billion to the result. Excluding inventory losses and non-operating items such as asset sales and deferred taxes, net profit was $7 billion. A Reuters poll of 11 analysts had given an average forecast of $5.7 billion, with the highest at $6 billion. The 21 percent rise in underlying profits compares with a 16 percent fall at BP Plc. July to September was the third straight quarter when Shell comfortably beat earnings forecasts. The results prompted Citigroup analyst Jonathan Wright to hint Shell shares could go from trading at a discount to BP shares, on a price-earnings basis, to a premium. \"There is a case building for Shell to at least close the valuation gap,\" Wright said in a research note. Investor confidence was knocked by massive oil and gas reserves downgrades in 2004 and huge cost overruns on key projects in 2005. STRONG PRODUCTION Profit was helped by oil prices, which hit a record average high in the third quarter, but production also beat forecasts. Shell managed to hold oil and gas output steady at 3.25 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the quarter, despite losing 185,000 boepd to civil strife in the Niger delta. Analysts had forecast 3.146 million boepd. Refining and marketing profits also came in much stronger than expected, rising around 25 percent, excluding inventory gains, despite lower refining margins. Profits on trading oil and gas also rose. Chief Executive Jeroen van der Veer said Shell had also kept a tight rein on costs, reassuring those who feared costs at its largest project at Sakhalin Island in East Russia were rising again after it doubled its cost estimate last year to $20 billion. It said the project budget of $20 billion figure still stood. Many industry figures had thought a $22 billion figure was now more likely, while some reports said costs had spiraled to $28 billion.

       "  ' Ed Leefeldt and Simon Challis \\n\\n NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - Scottish Re SCT.N shares surged more than 6 percent on Thursday after an analyst said the reinsurer\\'s search for a buyer was at an \"advanced phase,\" even as a source said one of six bidders had pulled out. Shares in Scottish Re, which buys blocks of life insurance from other insurers, rose 59 cents, or 5.5 percent, to close at $11.24, their highest level since July, when they plunged 75 percent after the company announced a liquidity crunch, a big second-quarter loss and its chief executive\\'s resignation. One of the six bidders for the company, Frankfurt-based Hannover Re ( HNRGn.DE ), has dropped out of the bidding, a source familiar with the situation said. Bear Stearns analyst Saul Martinez said that based on past conversations with management, he expected the company to reveal a sale of the company simultaneous with its third-quarter earnings announcement. Scottish Re has not said when it will report third-quarter earnings but under normal circumstances they would be announced on or before November 10. Martinez said in a report that a broad range for the price of the company would be $10 to $19 a share, but the winning bid would likely come in below the high end. The mid-point of the that range is $14.50 a share, a 36 percent premium to Wednesday\\'s close, he said. \"We believe the most likely outcome is the sale of Scottish Re as an entire entity and at a premium to the existing share price,\" said Martinez. But he acknowledged that risks exist. Hannover Re was one of six firms that were in the second phase of bidding for the Bermuda-based life reinsurer, but has now withdrawn from the process, the source said. Some analysts had regarded the German firm as the likely front-runner to buy its rival. \"It\\'s difficult to interpret this. It could simply mean that somebody else is now in the lead. I would think if there were problems with the (Scottish Re) business they would have dropped out earlier,\" said Richard Sbaschnig, analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. French reinsurer Scor ( SCOR.PA ) may now be among the favorites to enter exclusive negotiations with Scottish Re over a possible sale, analysts said. Scottish Re put itself up for sale in August following a big second-quarter loss and the departure of its chief executive. Earlier this month, the company said it had obtained $120 million in new financing to ease its liquidity problems, having earlier reduced some of its credit facilities at its operating companies. Hannover Re declined to comment and Scor was not available for comment.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. ( BUD.N ) on Wednesday said quarterly profit rose on higher prices and easing energy costs, narrowly beating Wall Street\\'s view and sending shares up 2 percent. \\n\\n The largest U.S. brewer, whose flagship brands include Budweiser and Bud Light, said third-quarter net income rose 26 percent to $638 million, or 82 cents per share, from $505 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting profit of 81 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales for the quarter rose 4.7 percent to $4.28 billion and total beer volume rose 2.9 percent, driven by a 2.8 percent rise in revenue per barrel, as Anheuser raised prices in some markets during the summer. The company said it plans to raise prices again on most of its volume early next year, with a few selective increases in the fourth quarter. Last year, the company took price cuts amid sluggish growth in the U.S. beer market, forcing competitors like Miller Brewing Co., a unit of SABMiller Plc ( SAB.L ), to follow suit. DOMESTIC GOING FLAT Anheuser-Busch, whose Bud Light is the top-selling brand in the United States, controls about half the U.S. beer market. But Bud Light\\'s dominance is being challenged by imported light beers, such as Heineken Premium Light. Volume of beer shipments to domestic wholesalers rose 1.1 percent during the quarter, but sales from wholesalers to retailers fell 0.4 percent. \"Sales to retailers were below our expectations due to a slowdown in September,\" Anheuser\\'s Chief Financial Officer W. Randolph Baker said on a conference call. He blamed unfavorable weather, especially during the Labor Day holiday, and said he did not think it was a long-term trend. Bear Stearns analyst Carlos Laboy said the lag implied there was now a \"considerable\" build-up of inventory. In a research note he said the next two quarters \"could be messy\" as Anheuser faces tough comparisons and two more inventory days. J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher said he thought the market had already anticipated such problems, which explained why the stock rose 97 cents to close at $47.86 on the New York Stock Exchange, reversing much of a 4 percent drop over the last week. INTERNATIONAL BUBBLING Volume in the company\\'s international unit rose 5.9 percent, helped by strength in Canada, China and Mexico. That segment\\'s sales also includes domestic sales of some foreign beers. Earlier this year the company bought Rolling Rock beer from Belgium\\'s InBev INTB.BR. That followed its moves to exclusively import and distribute Dutch brewer Grolsch NV\\'s GROLc.AS beers in the U.S. and exclusively import Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd.\\'s Tiger beer. Anheuser also has a 50 percent stake in Mexico\\'s Grupo Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ), which brews Corona, and a 27 percent stake in China\\'s Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd. ( 600600.SS ). These moves are ways for the U.S. brewer to capitalize on the growing popularity of imported and craft beers, which, along with wine and spirits, have been grabbing market share from domestic beers. In response to a question about the growing threat of imported beers, CFO Baker acknowledged that the success of Heineken NV\\'S ( HEIN.AS ) light beer and other imports were hurting sales, but said those volumes remained small. Looking ahead, the St. Louis, Missouri-based company said it will focus on marketing its flagship American beers. NEW PRODUCTS Anheuser-Busch also said it was still studying a hard liquor product in test markets called Jekyll and Hyde. \"We continue to see whether there are opportunities for products that fit into our portfolio that would be profitable for our wholesalers as well as Anheuser-Busch,\" Baker said. This autumn the company is rolling out bottles of a seasonal craft brew called Jack\\'s Pumpkin Spice Ale, which was previously only available by draught. Anheuser-Busch shares have gained 9.3 percent this year and trade at 18.5 times earnings estimates for the current year, outperforming a 2.5 percent gain for rival Molson Coors Brewing Co., ( TAP.N ) which has a price-to-earnings multiple of 17.4.',\n",

( CCE.N ) on Thursday posted quarterly profit below analysts\\' estimates, hurt by weakness in the North American soft-drink business, sending shares down 3 percent in morning trading. \\n\\n The world\\'s largest bottler of Coke drinks, which is being squeezed by higher aluminum prices, also said high costs would weigh on 2007 results. The company is planning cost cuts and other measures to counter the high costs of goods, but still had to lower its full-year earnings forecast. The company said net income for the third quarter was $213 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $192 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. But excluding restructuring charges and other items, earnings were flat at 45 cents a share, the company said. Analysts on average were expecting 47 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. A currency benefit and lower tax rate added to earnings, the company said. Revenue rose 6 percent to $5.21 billion. Consolidated volume rose 2 percent and net pricing per case rose 1 percent, which was not enough to offset the cost of sales per case, which rose 4 percent in the quarter due in part to higher commodity costs. J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher, who anticipated that the bottler\\'s stock would fall on Thursday due to the lower outlook, earnings miss and comments about raw material costs in 2007, said he believed the market was not pessimistic enough about the likely rise in cost of goods sold for 2007. In the key North American market, volume rose 0.5 percent as carbonated soft-drink volume fell 1 percent and volume of bottled water rose in the double digits. The company said the poor results in North America offset operating improvement in Europe. \"This quarter\\'s disappointing performance illustrates the urgency of our work to develop strategies and practices that will allow us to consistently deliver improved operating performance,\" John Brock, the company\\'s chief executive officer, said in a statement. Sales of carbonated soft drinks in developed markets such as the United States and Britain have been on the decline as health-conscious consumers forgo sugary beverages for healthier options like bottled water and juice. Looking ahead, the company, which is about 40 percent owned by Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ), the world\\'s biggest soft-drink company, said it now expects earnings of $1.25 to $1.28 a share in 2006, down from a previous forecast of $1.27 to $1.32 per share, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and restructuring charges, but includes stock-option expenses. \"We recognize 2007 will be challenging because of the high \\'cost of goods\\' environment we face next year,\" Brock said, adding that the company will give its 2007 financial outlook early next year, which is later than usual. In the past Coke Enterprises has provided an outlook in December. Earlier this month Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. PBG.N reported higher profit on price increases and volume growth, but concerns about the likely effect of rising costs for raw materials such as aluminum pushed the stock down. Coke Enterprises shares, which fell 59 cents to $20.45 on the New York Stock Exchange, had gained 9.8 percent this year and trade at 15.9 times estimated earnings for the current year.

       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Kellogg Co. ( K.N ), the No. 1 maker of breakfast cereal, on Thursday reported a 2.5 percent rise in quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street estimates as strong sales helped offset higher prices on commodities like fuel and grains. \\n\\n The producer of Frosted Flakes cereal and Keebler cookies also raised its 2006 earnings forecast, citing strength in the first nine months of the year, and its stock rose 1.7 percent. Kellogg has benefited in recent years from a steady stream of new, higher-priced cereals such as fruit varieties of Special K, and by expanding its presence in growing categories like breakfast bars and fruit snacks. But like many U.S. food makers, the Battle Creek, Michigan,-based company has been hit hard by soaring energy, grain and sugar costs. Last month, the company raised prices on some cereals by 2 percent to help offset the increased costs. Third-quarter net income rose to $281.1 million, or 70 cents per share, from $274.3 million, or 66 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected Kellogg to earn 65 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 7.6 percent to $2.82 billion, well above analysts\\' expectations of about $2.75 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Cereal sales in North America were up 3 percent, a sharp decrease from an 11 percent rise last year. Kellogg President David Mackay said the results were driven by demand for adult cereal brands like Smart Start and Mini-Wheats. \"If you look at the demographics in markets like the U.S. where you have an aging population, as people age they typically come back to cereal,\" Mackay said. \"We\\'re just trying to reflect through our innovation and what we do the market dynamics.\" D.A. Davidson analyst Tim Ramey said he had been expecting cereal sales to be down from last year\\'s robust level. \"That\\'s a good year-on-year rate of change given the performance last year,\" said Ramey, who has a \"buy\" rating on Kellogg shares and owns none. \"It was a very solid sales performance across the board.\" Snack sales rose 11 percent in North America, helped by strong demand for new snack-sized versions of Pop-Tarts toaster pastries called Go-Tarts and Cheez-It crackers. Gross margins, a measure of profitability, fell slightly from last year but improved from earlier this year in part because of lower restructuring costs. Margins are also expected to be up in the fourth quarter due to higher prices and cost-savings initiatives, Kellogg Chief Financial Officer Jeff Boromisa said on a conference call with analysts. Margins in 2007 are expected to be comparable to 2006. Kellogg now expects earnings of $2.48 to $2.50 a share for the year, compared with its previous forecast of $2.45 to $2.49 per share. The view includes up to 30 cents of increased costs due to energy and commodities as well as 15 cents of what Kellogg called \"up-front\" costs, or restructuring expenses. For 2007, the company forecast earnings of $2.67 to $2.72 a share, with sales up in the low single digits on a percentage basis. Analysts looked for $2.51 a share for 2006 and $2.74 in 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. Earlier this week, Kellogg said that Mackay will become chief executive as of December 31, replacing Jim Jenness, who will continue as chairman. Kellogg shares were up 84 cents, or 1.7 percent, at $50.48 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - McAfee Inc. MFE.N, the No. 2 security software maker, on Thursday posted higher quarterly profit and revenue that topped Wall Street forecasts, reflecting demand across all businesses and geographies. \\n\\n The company\\'s shares rose nearly 6 percent in extended trade. Third-quarter net income rose to $30.3 million or 19 cents per share from $22.5 million, or 13 cents per share a year ago. Excluding items the company said its per-share profit was 36 cents. This was above the Wall Street view of 30 cents on revenue of $275.9 million as compiled by Reuters Estimates. \"They delivered solid results across the board,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR. \"It is evidence of a strong product cycle.\" The company said the results were preliminary because of a previously announced need to restate past financial statements to record additional noncash charges for stock-based compensation expense. Earlier in October, McAfee fired its president, Kevin Weiss, and said its chairman and chief executive, George Samenuk, would retire after an internal probe into the software maker\\'s stock option practices. The company also said it expected to take a charge of $100 million to $150 million to restate earnings to reflect more stock-based compensation expense. At least 140 companies, many of them based in Silicon Valley, have launched internal investigations or are facing probes by federal regulators to determine if the dates of stock options were manipulated. The Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service are also examining possible wrongdoing. McAfee\\'s results also come a day after its rival Symantec Corp. ( SYMC.O ), the world\\'s biggest security software maker, posted quarterly earnings and an outlook at the low end of expectations as its sales struggled in Europe. McAfee\\'s third-quarter revenue rose to $287.8 million from $252.9 million a year ago. Bookings during the quarter increased 16 percent to $349 million with growth in North America particularly strong, the company said. Corporate revenue rose 14 percent to $168 million while sales of the company\\'s consumer products increased 14 percent to $120 million. Santa Clara, California,-based McAfee also said it planned to spend its surplus cash on research and development, small- to mid-sized acquisitions and share buybacks. It added, however, that it could not buy back shares due to the ongoing stock option review and pending restatement. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, McAfee expects revenue between $275 million to $295 million with earnings per share before items of 31 cents to 35 cents. Analysts on average were looking for revenue of $287 million with earnings per share before items of 33 cents for the fourth quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. McAfee shares rose nearly 6 percent to $28.30 in extended trade from a close of $26.82 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.',\n",

( CCU.N ) into junk territory, citing the company\\'s statement that it is exploring alternatives to raise its share price, including a possible leveraged buyout. \\n\\n Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings both rate Clear Channel\\'s senior unsecured debt \"BBB-minus,\" and Moody\\'s Investors Service rates the debt \"Baa3,\" and all are their lowest investment grade rankings. Private equity groups Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone and KKR are in advanced talks to buy Clear Channel, the largest U.S. radio company, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.  Clear Channel, which operates more than 1,200 radio stations, earlier on Wednesday responded to reports that it was considering offers to be taken private by saying it had hired Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) to help it evaluate strategic alternatives. The company said a deal was not certain. \"Because of the potential size of the buyout, Standard & Poor\\'s expects the equity contribution to be small, resulting in significant levels of additional debt,\" S&P said in a statement. S&P noted that the company\\'s statement comes after a number of shareholder-favoring initiatives, including a $1 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in early September. \"While there are numerous possible outcomes from this announcement, Fitch believes that on balance there is a higher likelihood of a negative outcome for bondholders,\" Fitch said in a statement.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ), the nation\\'s largest cable operator, on Thursday reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on record subscriber growth, sparking a jump in cable shares. \\n\\n Comcast, which reaffirmed its full-year outlook, said its bottom line was also helped by one-time gains from its July purchase of cable systems from bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications Corp. ADELQ.PK and system swaps with Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ). Without the gains, income was $548 million, or 26 cents a share, beating the average analyst target of 19 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Like other cable operators, Comcast has been winning customers by offering cable television, phone and Internet services in one package, at a lower price than if they were bought separately from Internet, phone or satellite TV companies. Even as competitors AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) have started their own TV offerings to compete with cable, Comcast reported record growth in digital video, phone and Internet subscribers. \"I see a lot of opportunities for Comcast and all the other (cable) operators to continue strong growth in revenue and cash flow,\" said Robert Routh analyst at Jefferies & Co. Third-quarter net profit rose to $1.22 billion, or 58 cents per share, after the tax gains, from $222 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 22 percent to $6.43 billion, but missed the Reuters Estimates consensus target of $6.49 billion. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said he expected another record quarter of growth in the current period. \"We believe that this quarter will be as good or we hope even better,\" Roberts said on a call with analysts. CABLE SHARES UP Comcast shares, which have risen about 50 percent since the start of the year, advanced 3.2 percent, or $1.24, to close at $40.0 on Nasdaq. The results helped lift other cable stocks, with Time Warner rising nearly 1 percent to $19.99, Cablevision ( CVC.N ) rising 0.4 percent to $27.7, Charter Communications ( CHTR.O ) gaining 12 percent to close at $2.12, and Mediacom MCCC.O adding 5.5 percent to $8.20. \"I think investors are finally coming round to recognizing the power of cable\\'s triple play offer,\" Craig Moffett analyst at Bernstein Research said. \"Expectations are being set to more appropriately high levels.\" Comcast signed up 558,000 digital video subscribers in the quarter, pushing its penetration in that business past the 50 percent mark for the first time. It added a net 381,000 phone customers, 536,000 Internet subscribers, and 10,000 basic video subscribers. Analyst Todd Mitchell of Kaufman Bros. expected Comcast to add 400,000 in digital video, 400,000 in Internet, 345,000 phone customers, and 20,000 basic video subscribers. Comcast, with 24.1 million cable customers, reaffirmed its 2006 outlook, updated to include the Adelphia/Time Warner deal which closed on July 31. Cable revenue growth will be 10 percent to 11 percent above 2005 pro-forma revenue of $23.6 billion. It also said net additions of subscribers who take new cable services will rise by 60 percent over the previous year\\'s pro-forma figure of 3 million. \"Our expectation is that they will beat their reaffirmed outlook for the year,\" UBS analyst Aryeh Bourkoff said. Under the July deal, Comcast increased its market share in Florida, New England, Minneapolis and its home base of Pennsylvania.',\n",

MEDI.O said on Thursday that its third-quarter loss narrowed as sales of its respiratory drug Synagis and flu vaccine FluMist rose. \\n\\n The Gaithersburg, Maryland-based biotechnology company posted a net loss of $56 million, or 23 cents a share, including stock-based compensation expenses, compared to a loss of $64 million, or 26 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 15 percent, to $177 million. Excluding stock option expenses the company reported a loss of 30 cents a share, in line with analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales of Synagis rose 11 percent to $112 million, while sales of FluMist rose 52 percent to $16 million. The company also received about $7 million in royalty and milestone payments from the European approval and U.S. sales of Merck & Co.'s ( MRK.N ) human papillomavirus vaccine. The company said sales of Synagis were driven by an increased focus on commercialization, including completing the expansion and training of its pediatric infectious disease sales force, and working with physicians and nurses to better identify and track appropriate patients. The company said it has sold about 1.7 million doses of FluMist so far this year, compared with the 1.3 million doses it sold for the entire season last year. The company said it has increased its 2006 earnings estimate to a range of 17 cents to 22 cents a share, excluding share based compensation expenses, due to the gain on an investment. The company said it continues to believe that total revenue for 2006 will increase about 4 percent to about $1.3 billion.\",\n",

Liddell said the software giant plans to make up the 4-cent per share shortfall with better performance and additional buybacks. He also said Microsoft is \"confident\" it can meet its target to ship 10 million Xbox 360 video game consoles by the end of 2006 and that it expects the cost of the next-generation video game player to decline in the current quarter.',\n",
       "  ' SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) posted an 11 percent rise in quarterly net profit on Thursday, boosted by a strong performance at its database division and shrinking losses from its Xbox 360 video game console. \\n\\n The world\\'s largest software maker also said it will defer revenue of $1.5 billion related to the upcoming launches of a new Office software suite and Windows Vista, the first major upgrade of its operating system in five years. Including the effects of the deferral, which will reduce profit this quarter by 11 cents per share, Microsoft forecast second-quarter profit of between 22 cents and 24 cents per share on revenue of $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast second-quarter earnings of 36 cents per share on sales of $13.4 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. In after-hours trade, Microsoft shares rose to $28.50 from a close of $28.35 on Nasdaq. The revenue deferral stems from a coupon program announced this week to allow buyers of personal computers to upgrade to Vista and Office 2007 when they debut next year. \"People might be concerned that operating income may drop in the next quarter, but what\\'s happening is that they\\'re deferring revenues for an upgrade program to Windows Vista,\" said Toan Tran, an analyst with Morningstar. \"It really has no effect on the cash flow Microsoft has. It just won\\'t be recognized until the third quarter.\" The company also gave a full-year earnings outlook range of $1.43 to $1.46 per share on revenue of between $50 billion and $50.9 billion. Wall Street analysts have been looking for a full-year profit of $1.44 per share on sales of $50.3 billion. Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell told Reuters in an interview that the full-year outlook was stronger than it might first appear. A $20 billion tender offer for shares set for August was not fully completed, leaving a larger share base that would lower earnings by 4 cents per share more than previously anticipated, he said. But the company aimed to make that up with a better performance and other share repurchase programs. \"That\\'s primarily due to the fact that the tender was not fully subscribed, but we\\'re obviously very happy that we are able to maintain the range we previously had,\" Liddell said. \"The way I look at it, we are able to make up all of that shortfall.\" In its first quarter ended September 30, net profit was $3.48 billion, or 35 cents per diluted share, up 11 percent from $3.14 billion, or 29 cents per diluted share, a year ago. Sales rose 11 percent to $10.8 billion in the quarter. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings per share of 31 cents on revenue of $10.7 billion, based on Reuters Estimates. Microsoft posted sales and profit growth at its server and tools business, powered by a 30-percent year-on-year rise in sales of its database software platform, SQL Server, and solid demand for its Windows server software. The company also said it had sold 6 million Xbox 360 video game consoles since the launch last November, and losses at its entertainment and devices division shrank to $96 million from $173 million a year ago and $414 million the previous quarter. \"We\\'re progressively lowering the manufacturing costs of the console,\" Liddell said. \"So even for the ones we do sell, we are in a better shape from a loss-per-console perspective.\" He added that the number of games sold per Xbox rose in the quarter. While video game machines often sell at a loss, the games themselves are highly profitable. Microsoft shares have risen about 25 percent since June, hitting a near-two-year high on investor optimism that the much-anticipated Windows and Office upgrades will pay off. Microsoft is expected to launch Windows Vista and Office 2007 for corporate customers this quarter, and for retail consumers early next year. The two product lines comprise more than half of Microsoft\\'s revenue and almost all of its profit.

       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp. said on Thursday it swung to a quarterly loss due to the mounting cost of recalling millions of computer batteries, coming in sharp contrast to a surge in profit at rival Nintendo Co. on its hit DS handheld game machine. \\n\\n The deep loss at Sony comes despite the boost of a softer yen and robust sales of flat TVs and digital cameras, factors that are expected to lifted earnings at Panasonic maker Matsushita Electric Industrial, which reports on Friday. Top personal computer makers including Dell Inc., Apple Computer Inc., Toshiba Corp. and Sony itself are recalling up to 9.6 million Sony-made computer batteries, which in rare cases can overheat and catch fire. Sony kept its forecast for a sharp fall in annual profit and warned that a price war in the flat TV market could heat up. \"I know that companies like Sharp, Samsung and Panasonic will all stage a full-out offensive during the year-end shopping season. We will take necessary steps to respond,\" Sony Chief Financial Officer Nobuyuki Oneda told a news conference. Sony, which competes with Nintendo and Microsoft Corp. in video games and the likes of Sharp Corp. and Matsushita in flat TVs, posted a group operating loss of 20.83 billion yen ($175 million) in the July-September second quarter. That compares with a restated 74.56 billion yen profit in the same quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 8.3 percent to 1.85 trillion yen. Nintendo, meanwhile, said its operating profit more than trebled in the fiscal first half, buoyed by its hot-selling DS handheld game device, and it stood by its annual outlook for 60 percent profit growth. Kyoto-based Nintendo has scored a smash hit with the DS, which allows players to give commands using a stylus instead of a key pad and has attracted game novices by offering casual and easy-to-play games. April-September operating profit at Nintendo, known for game characters such as Mario, Donkey Kong and Pokemon, totaled 67.1 billion yen ($565 million), up from 19.6 billion yen a year earlier. Sales rose 69.4 percent to 298.82 billion yen. SONY SEES GAME LOSS Nintendo earlier this month revised up its earnings forecasts for both the April-September first half and full year to March 2007. It also raised its DS sales forecast for the year to March by 3 million units to 20 million. Sony\\'s result was also well flagged because last week it had cut its full-year operating profit forecast by 62 percent due to an estimated 51 billion yen in recall costs and a wider loss at its game unit, and said its second quarter loss likely came to 21 billion yen. The battery recall has shaken consumer confidence in Sony\\'s technological competitiveness and cast a shadow over its brand image as a top class manufacturer, which has in the past enabled it to charge a premium for its products. Compounding difficulties at Sony, the maker of Bravia brand liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs and Cyber-shot digital cameras, is a bloating loss at its video game division. Sony said last week that losses at its game unit will likely balloon to 200 billion yen in the year to next March 31 because of sluggish sales of PlayStation Portable handheld players and a price cut for a model of the PlayStation 3 game console in Japan. It plans to launch the PlayStation 3 in Japan and North America next month, fighting with Nintendo\\'s Wii and Microsoft\\'s Xbox 360 for holiday shoppers\\' attention in the nearly $30 billion video game industry. For the year to March, Sony reiterated its week-old operating profit estimate of 50 billion yen, down from a revised 226.42 billion yen a year earlier. That compares with the consensus of 75 billion yen in a poll of 14 analysts by Reuters Estimates. Nintendo kept its previous operating profit forecast of 145 billion yen, a touch below the 148 billion yen consensus. Shares in Nintendo closed down 0.5 percent at 24,200 yen prior to the announcement, underperforming the benchmark Nikkei average, which rose 0.67 percent. Shares in Sony closed flat at 4,820 yen.

The possible sale of Sagem had already prompted market speculation that Motorola might be attracted by it, and a leading Motorola executive confirmed to French paper Le Figaro that the U.S. company was looking at Sagem. \"We have a serious interest in Sagem. It\\'s an option in a sector that is in the process of consolidating ... I do not know yet if we will get it,\" the head of Motorola\\'s mobile devices business Ronald Garriques told Le Figaro in an interview. Safran shares rose as much as 6.8 percent to an intraday high of 17.94 euros. The stock was up 5.7 percent at 17.75 euros in early afternoon trade in Paris. Safran said it welcomed Motorola\\'s interest. \"Following statements by Motorola reported in a major French daily national newspaper, Safran is pleased to note that one of the major players in the telecommunications market has publicly recognised the quality and professionalism of the teams at Safran\\'s mobile phones division,\" it said in a statement. \"Safran also notes that a potential link-up with another mobile phone maker is only one possibility to ensure the sustainable success of this business,\" it added. A Safran spokeswoman reiterated that all options were being considered for Sagem, but declined further comment. \"We want to keep our staff and find the best possible solution,\" she added. Safran was created through the 2004 merger of aerospace group Snecma and Sagem, but there had been widespread market speculation of rifts between the two separate businesses. In August, the head of Safran\\'s telecoms arm quit, sparking speculation of a possible sale of the Sagem unit.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S.N ) on Thursday reported a fall in third-quarter profit due to merger-related costs, and posted wireless subscriber growth that missed already low analyst estimates. \\n\\n Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. wireless service, has been losing market share to rivals this year as it grappled with criticism of its network quality, its marketing message and its cell phone line-up as it weeds out bad debt customers and struggles to integrate its Nextel purchase. The company said it had added 233,000 net new subscribers in the quarter, just below average forecasts of nearly 239,000 from 12 analysts contacted by Reuters. It lost a net 188,000 postpaid customers -- seen as the most valuable and predictable as they pay monthly bills -- and blamed voluntary and involuntary departures. Sprint has had to force some customers who did not pay bills to leave. Investors, who have shaved about 30 percent off Sprint\\'s share price since its problems started to emerge six months ago, would need to hear signs of a turnaround on its earnings conference call before changing their views, analysts said. \"Wireless subscriber growth was a little weaker than we expected,\" said Stanford Group analyst Michael Nelson. \"There\\'s nothing in the numbers that gives me more or less confidence in the company\\'s ability to turn around the wireless business.\" Sprint\\'s net profit fell to $247 million, or 8 cents per share, from $516 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier numbers reflected that Sprint did not own Nextel Communications until August 12, 2005. Excluding 22 cents of amortization costs plus other items, Sprint said it earned 32 cents per share. On that basis, analysts, on average, had expected 33 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $10.496 billion from $7.825 billion, compared with average analyst estimates of $10.48 billion. Analysts say Sprint is losing market share to its biggest rival, Cingular Wireless, and the No. 2 U.S. service, Verizon Wireless, owned by Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) and Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ). Cingular, the venture of AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and BellSouth Corp. BLS.N, last week posted total net subscriber additions of 1.35 million for the quarter. Sprint said it was maintaining its forecast for full-year revenue of $41 billion to $41.5 billion and operating income of $12.9 billion before depreciation and amortization. The company said its postpaid customer cancellation rate, known in the industry as churn, rose to 2.4 percent from 2.1 percent in the second quarter.

       "  '  (Updates with closing market quotes, paragraphs 8-11) \\n\\n  By  Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON  Oct 27 (Reuters) - A slumping housing sector\\nhelped slow U.S. economic growth in the third quarter to its\\nweakest pace in over three years, leading financial markets to\\nraise bets on interest-rate cuts next year.  Gross domestic product, which measures total economic\\nactivity within U.S. borders, expanded at a 1.6 percent annual\\nrate during the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported\\non Friday. This was down from 2.6 percent in the second quarter\\nfor the slowest advance since the first quarter of 2003.  The Bush administration insisted the soft GDP data, coming\\nless than two weeks before the Nov. 7 congressional elections,\\ndid not signal the economy was spiraling downward but only that\\nit was moving to a slower and steadier growth rate.  \"I\\'m feeling good about making this economic ... transition\\nfrom an unsustainable rate to a more sustainable rate,\"\\nTreasury Secretary Henry Paulson said during a relatively rare\\nmeeting with print reporters in Treasury\\'s pressroom.  Democrats expressed concern the economy was slowing at a\\ntime when workers were already struggling to keep up with\\ninflation, a theme they have pressed on the campaign trail.  Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi, in line to become\\nSpeaker if Democrats capture the U.S. House of Representatives,\\nsaid growth in earnings was not keeping up with rising costs of\\nhealth care, food and energy.  \"By these measures, our economy is not nearly as strong as\\nit should be,\" Pelosi said.  The dollar sank to a one-month low against a basket of\\nmajor currencies on the signs of softness. The risk that\\ncorporate profits might suffer in a slower economy also hurt\\nstocks.  The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  lost 73.40 points\\nto end at 12,090.26 while the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC \\nfinished down 28.48 points at 2,350.62.  But bond investors took heart at signs that slower growth\\nmight ease price pressures and keep interest rates on hold.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR gained\\n11/32 in price to 101-17/32 for a yield of 4.68 percent while\\nthe 30-year bond was up 20/32 in price at 95-1/32, yielding\\n4.80 percent.  STILL SPENDING  Consumers showed no sign that weakening housing prices were\\ndampening their spirits. A survey from the University of\\nMichigan indicated consumers were even more optimistic as the\\nfourth quarter opened than previously thought.  A final October reading of the University of Michigan\\'s\\nconsumer sentiment index came in at 93.6, up from a preliminary\\n92.3 and September\\'s final reading of 85.4, said sources who\\nsaw the subscription-only report.  Economic growth in the third quarter was well below Wall\\nStreet forecasts for a 2.2 percent increase and reflected a\\nrange of influences that combined to slow the economy.  The report showed a striking 17.4 percent annual rate of\\ndecrease in spending on new housing - the biggest decline in\\n15-1/2 years.  In addition, growth in business spending on inventories\\nslowed to only a $50.7 billion rate, subtracting 0.1 percentage\\npoint from GDP growth, and the value of imported goods\\naccelerated sharply to a 7.8 percent annual rate of increase in\\nthe third quarter, more than three times the second quarter\\'s\\n1.4 percent increase.  Analysts noted the data was old and that growth appears set\\nto pick up modestly in the current fourth quarter.  \"Housing took a toll on the economy but bear in mind this\\nwas last quarter, and the current quarter is on a growth pace\\nthat would double this number\" because of consumer spending,\\nsaid economist Richard Yamarone of Argus Research Corp. in New\\nYork.  The drag on growth from a rapidly softening housing sector\\nhad been expected, since other reports have shown prices are\\nweakening for both new and existing homes.  COMPANIES INVESTING  By contrast, the GDP report showed business investment\\nremained healthy and consumers picked up their spending pace.  Nonresidential investment, which measures business\\nspending, rose at an 8.6 percent annual rate in the third\\nquarter, close to double the second quarter\\'s 4.4 percent.\\nConsumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of\\nnational economic activity, increased at a 3.1 percent rate, up\\nfrom 2.6 percent in the second quarter.  So-called core prices excluding food and energy items -- an\\ninflation measure the Federal Reserve watches -- climbed 2.4\\npercent on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter.  But there were signs that price rises might be easing. In\\nthe third quarter, core prices advanced at a 2.3 percent rate\\nafter rising 2.7 percent in the second quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

( CAH.N ) on\\nFriday posted an 18 percent jump in quarterly profit on strong\\ngrowth in its drug distribution business, topping expectations,\\nbut shares fell nearly 2 percent on continued troubles at its drug\\nmanufacturing and hospital products units.  Cardinal said net profit rose to $270 million, or 66 cents per\\nshare, in the first quarter ended Sept. 30, from $228 million, or\\n53 cents a year ago, which included a large charge.  Excluding special items but including options expenses,\\nearnings from continuing operations rose 27 percent to $320\\nmillion, or 78 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 76\\ncents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.  Shares were off 1.5 percent in morning trading.  Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said in a research note the drug\\ndistribution business was strong, but the drug-manufacturing and\\nClinical Technologies and Services, or CTS unit, \"visibly missed\\nsales and margin targets.\"  Revenue from its CTS segment rose 3 percent to $549 million,\\nbut operating earnings in the segment fell 14 percent to $68\\nmillion.  The unit was hurt by the late-August recall of its Alaris SE\\npump infusion pump, an electronic device used to control the\\ndelivery of intravenous solutions or medications.  Dublin, Ohio-based Cardinal suspended production, sales,\\nrepairs and installations of the pumps after U.S. regulators\\nseized about 1,300 of the devices because they could pose a risk\\nto patients.  Cardinal said the unit also suffered from delays in two new\\nproduct introductions.  Revenue from its drug manufacturing unit gained 10 percent to\\n$451 million. Operating earnings were up 13 percent to $22 million\\nas strong growth in its softgel and quick-dissolve drug\\nmanufacturing business offset continued declines in its sterile\\nmanufacturing business.  Revenue from its drug-distribution business rose 12 percent to\\n$18.5 billion. Operating earnings rose 24 percent to $301 million,\\nhelped by a strong mix of generic drug sales and cost control\\nmeasures, which were offset in part by continued pressure on\\nprofit margins.  For fiscal 2007, Cardinal backed its view for non-GAAP diluted\\nearnings from operations of $3.50 to $3.70 per share. Analysts, on\\naverage, expected $3.67 per share for the full year.  Total revenue rose 11 percent to $21.4 billion.  Cardinal stock fell 97 cents to $64.43 on the New York Stock\\nExchange Friday.

RIM.TORIMM.O has received an informal inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to its internal review of stock-option grants, the company said late on Friday. \\n\\n RIM said that aside from the letter from the SEC, it has also been in communication with the Ontario Securities Commission, Canada's main securities regulator, in relation to the voluntary review, which it first announced late last month. Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM is the latest of a growing number of companies to be queried by U.S. authorities over option grants. A number of those companies have also launched their own inquiries into whether they manipulated the grant date of options to benefit executives who received them. Some of the cases involve backdating, in which companies boosted the value of stock options given to employees by setting their grant dates to coincide with a previous low point in the value of the underlying stock. Criminal charges have been laid against some company officials, including former executives of Brocade Communications Systems Inc. ( BRCD.O ) RIM also said on Friday it expects to file its financial statements for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 as soon as possible. The company repeated that it would need to restate its historical results, but added it does not expect a material adjustment to the preliminary second-quarter operating results reported on September 28.

UAUA.O, said the carrier increased the prices on Thursday night to offset the higher cost of fuel. U.S. airlines have implemented several fare hikes this year to combat soaring fuel prices. UAL spokeswoman Robin Urbanski said that despite a recent decline in fuel prices, fares in some markets are still too low. The price of crude oil CLc1 -- directly linked to the price of jet fuel -- has fallen more than 20 percent since August, but the price remains historically high and a burden for airlines. On Friday, crude was trading at $60.78 a barrel. AMR Corp's AMR.N American Airlines matched United's increase on Friday morning, an AMR spokesman said. Bankrupt Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK said it also has matched the increase. Continental Airlines CAL.N said it has not matched. It remains to be seen whether the fare increases will last.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker BorgWarner Inc. ( BWA.N ) on Friday said quarterly earnings fell 36 percent as vehicle production cuts by Detroit-based automakers hurt results, pushing the company\\'s shares down 3 percent. \\n\\n Cuts in North American production of light trucks and sport utility vehicles made the quarter especially challenging, said the company, which makes products such as turbochargers, clutch systems, engine timing devices and traction controls. BorgWarner and other U.S. parts suppliers had warned that output cuts at General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler AG\\'s DCX.N DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group would hurt results in the 2006 second half. The company also said it expects net new business of $1.7 billion in the three-year period from 2007 through 2009, up from a projected $1.6 billion in 2006 through 2008. About 12 percent is seen coming in North America from the Big Three automakers. \"As expected, it was tough quarter, but the growth in the international operations and expected backlog is encouraging,\" Morningstar analyst John Novak said. \"BorgWarner should be able to manage through this industry downturn and looks to be well-positioned for the long-term.\" Net income fell to $39.2 million, or 68 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $61.4 million, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 1 percent to $1.06 billion. Excluding one-time charges, BorgWarner earned 77 cents per share. On that basis, analysts, on average, expected 86 cents per share, on revenue of $1.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 5 percent in its engine group segment to $736.4 million, but segment earnings fell 19 percent to $76.1 million due to pressure from higher costs for raw materials, mainly nickel, and lost U.S. sales. Sales fell 8 percent in the drivetrain group to $330.1 million and segment earnings fell 45 percent to $13.2 million. \\'DIFFICULT QUARTER\\' \"We had a difficult quarter, but our fundamental growth drivers remain strong,\" Chief Executive Timothy Manganello said in a conference call with analysts. \"No one here at BorgWarner is satisfied with our third-quarter financial performance.\" BorgWarner expects $530 million of net new business in 2007, $530 million in 2008 and $640 million in 2009. Europe accounts for 46 percent of the new business; Asia for about 27 percent, with the bulk in that region in Korea and China; and North America for about 27 percent, including transplant and domestic automakers, BorgWarner said. About 73 percent of the business is in engine-related products such as turbochargers, ignition systems, emissions products and engine timing systems, it said. The rest is in transmission modules and all-wheel drive systems. In September, BorgWarner said it would cut about 850 jobs, or 13 percent of its North American work force, and lowered its 2006 earnings forecast because of the production slump. On Friday, BorgWarner stood by that full-year earnings forecast of $3.95 to $4.10 per share, excluding 15 cents per share of restructuring charges. Analysts expect $4.03. Shares of BorgWarner were down $1.81, or 2.95 percent, at $59.50 Friday at midmorning on the New York Stock Exchange.',\n",

       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), the world\\'s fourth-largest carmaker, beat expectations by nearly doubling third-quarter operating profit before special items, and reaffirmed its forecast for a full-year increase on Friday. \\n\\n Helped by ongoing efforts to cut costs and slash jobs in its troubled VW brand operations, group operating profit increased to 991 million euros ($1.25 billion) excluding 668 million euros in one-off charges mainly to top up its pension fund. A Reuters poll had forecast on average 906 million euros before special items and 311 million for operating profit after items versus VW\\'s reported figure of 323 million. \"Although we have made significant progress in improving our competitiveness, we are still not satisfied with what we have achieved,\" Chief Financial Officer Hans Dieter Poetsch said. \"This is the year in which we set the course for the future and the long-term success of our company. Our goal is clear: We want to generate profit before tax of 5.1 billion euros in 2008,\" he added in a statement. Following Thursday\\'s profit warning by rival French carmaker PSA ( PEUP.PA ), Volkswagen stuck to its forecast for a full-year increase in pre-exceptional operating profit and a positive net cash flow at its core automotive business. After pulling in an average of 1 billion in operating profit per quarter, VW now needs to add only a further 124 million euros in the final three months of this year to reach its goal. \"Restructuring is well on track. This was an unspectacular good quarter,\" said Patrick Juchemich, analyst at Sal. Oppenheim. Volkswagen said third quarter revenue rose 7.1 percent to 25.1 billion euros and deliveries also advanced 7.1 percent as it pushed new models like the Eos, Passat and Jetta cars. Earnings before tax, which include the non-consolidated results of the group\\'s two key Chinese joint ventures, fell by half to 186 million euros. After tax, earnings plunged to 23 million euros. On a divisional basis the VW Brand Group before one-offs swung to an operating profit of 350 million euros from a loss of 54 million in the third quarter last year, while the Audi Brand Group grew profits by 46 percent to 437 million -- both easily beating the Reuters poll estimates. MASS CARMAKERS SUFFERING Separately, Volkswagen said it had filed plans with the German cartel office to raise its stake in German truckmaker MAN ( MANG.DE ) to more than 25 percent, sending VW stock lower. Volkswagen wants MAN and Sweden\\'s Scania ( SCVb.ST ), in which VW holds 34 percent of its voting rights, to merge in a deal that would create the European truck market leader. High expectations for a restructuring success have priced shares in Volkswagen at a premium to its peers. The stock trades at 13.6 times next year\\'s estimated earnings, according to Reuters Estimates. This compares to 13.0 times 2007 earnings for DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE and 8.1 times at Renault ( RENA.PA ). Volkswagen shares came off session lows to trade down 1.3 percent at 76.23 euros at 1011 GMT, underperforming a flat DJ Stoxx European automotive index .SXAP. Struggling to fully use their production capacity as demand remains sluggish, mass-market carmakers in both Europe and the United States have watched profit margins erode as high labor costs weigh and Asian competitors aggressively woo buyers. Among the top five carmakers by volume, only Toyota ( 7203.T ) is celebrating unmitigated success in the mass-market business thanks to its reputation for high quality, an attractive mix of fuel-efficient cars and a soft yen.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Next week may determine the sustainability of a recent shift from U.S. energy stocks to non-cyclical sectors when payroll data and several other key economic growth indicators are released amid a heavy stream of earnings reports. \\n\\n The trend toward bigger-cap technology, health-care and consumer stocks that helped the Dow break through its all-time record and the 12,000 mark was briefly interrupted this week as energy and material stocks hopped back into the lead. But Friday\\'s weaker-than-expected data on gross domestic product suggests stocks that are less sensitive to growth will be the ones poised to lead. Besides all the data, 94 of the 500 components of the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  will give quarterly profit updates next week. \"We\\'re still in the thick of earnings,\" said Todd Clark, director of stock trading at Nollenberger Capital Partners in San Francisco. \"We also get the Chicago Purchasing Managers\\' number and the ISM manufacturing survey. Both of those are pretty important data points so we\\'re going to see some meaningful macro numbers coincide with what we\\'ve got as far as corporate earnings.\" The Labor Department\\'s nonfarm payrolls report on Friday will wrap up a data-packed week, when investors will watch for signs that the economy is still growing at a healthy pace while inflation remains moderate. Economists polled by Reuters believe that payrolls grew by 125,000 jobs in October, compared with a gain of just 51,000 in September. Average hourly earnings are forecast to rise 0.3 percent in October, after an increase of 0.2 percent the previous month. Investors will start the week with the latest read on inflation data on Monday, with the release of September personal income and consumption data, and the accompanying price index. Three other key gauges of economic growth are set for release in the week ahead: The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago\\'s index of Midwest business activity on Tuesday; the Institute for Supply Management\\'s manufacturing survey on Wednesday, and the ISM\\'s survey on the services, or non-manufacturing, sector on Friday. The Conference Board will issue its consumer confidence index on Tuesday, with economists expecting an October reading of 108.0, up from 104.5 in September. Domestic car and truck sales for October are due on Wednesday, with the Reuters poll forecasting a slower pace. TRACKING BIG OIL Of the 10 Standard & Poor\\'s major industry groups, energy and materials were the top two performers, while industrials, technology and health care lagged at the bottom, all netting negative returns for the week. \"The groups that have led the market are oil and oil services. These areas since have corrected around over 10 percent and in some cases 20 percent, but they\\'ve come back very quickly,\" said Carl Birkelbach, founder and chief executive of Birkelbach Investment Securities in Chicago. \"We\\'re at the point where these need to correct some more,\" he added. \"For the market to make its next move, for the Dow to aim for 14,000, those will have to take a little rest.\" Signs of a further slowdown in the economy could force energy and other commodity stocks to take that rest, as decreased business activity would slacken demand for their products. But economic figures won\\'t be the only factor determining prices of commodity-related equities. The slew of energy and oil-services companies set to report earnings next week include Marathon Oil Corp. ( MRO.N ), Devon Energy Crop. ( DVN.N ), Dominion Resources Inc. ( D.N ) and Valero Energy Corp. ( VLO.N ). U.S. crude oil prices are down about 23 percent from a record set in mid-July. On Friday, December crude CLZ6 settled at $60.75 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. POWER PLAY Power utility companies, another safe bet in a slowing economy, are featured prominently on next week\\'s earnings calendar. Those scheduled to give quarterly reports include Entergy Corp. ( ETR.N ) on Tuesday, DTE Energy Co. ( DTE.N ) on Wednesday and Consolidated Edison Inc. ( ED.N ) on Thursday. The Dow components set to report results next week are telecommunication services provider Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) on Monday, while on Tuesday, earnings are due from consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) . PITY THE SMALL FRY On Friday, stocks finished the session lower. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 73.40 points, or 0.60 percent, to end at 12,090.26. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  dropped 11.74 points, or 0.85 percent, to finish at 1,377.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  declined 28.48 points, or 1.20 percent, to close at 2,350.62. For the week, though, stocks rose. The Dow gained 0.7 percent, while the S&P 500 added 0.6 percent, and the Nasdaq advanced 0.4 percent. Data on Friday showed third-quarter U.S. economic growth was the weakest in more than three years, which sent all three major U.S. stock indexes lower. But it was the smaller-capitalization indexes that suffered the most. The Russell 2000 index .RUT fell 1.4 percent and the Midcap 400 Index .MID fell 1.2 percent. Smaller-cap U.S. stocks, which tend to be less geographically diversified, usually fare worse when U.S. economic conditions weaken. \"With the GDP number in mind, investors will be looking for what type of growth there will be in the economy,\" said Richard Sichel, who oversees $1.5 billion as chief investment officer of Philadelphia Trust Co. in Philadelphia. \"The global economy is a very big positive, so the types of U.S. companies investors need to key into are the industrials and other big ones that can continue to participate in strong global growth.\" (Wall St Week Ahead runs weekly.

The deal would give Cemex CEMEXCPO.MX( CX.N ), already the top U.S. cement player, even bigger operations there as 80 percent of Rinker\\'s earnings come from the United States. If shareholders accept the unsolicited offer, it will be the biggest-ever takeover by a Mexican company, more than twice the size of Cemex\\'s 2005 acquisition of Britain\\'s RMC for $5.8 billion. Rinker\\'s shares jumped 5.8 percent in late trade to close at A$14.70 on Friday. Cemex\\'s Mexican shares dropped 2.44 percent to 33.60 pesos. Its New York-traded stock fell 1.72 percent to $31.44. Rinker is focused on the fast-growing states of Florida and Arizona and Rinker\\'s business in Australia, where it is the market leader, will open a new market for Cemex. The combined company would have revenue of $23.2 billion, Cemex said. \"Rinker represents a good opportunity for Cemex, given it has solid presence in key regions of the United States, which according to Cemex, complement its current operations,\" said Marco Reyes, analyst with Scotia brokerage in Mexico. A Rinker spokeswoman in Sydney said the company had not been expecting a takeover offer. \"It was clearly an unsolicited bid. It\\'s too early to make any comment at this stage about our response,\" said Rinker spokeswoman Debra Stirling. Shares of Rinker, which makes crushed rock, cement, asphalt, concrete and concrete pipes, have lost nearly one-third of their value since April on concerns about the U.S. housing market. \"The acquisition of Rinker meets our strict investment criteria and will further reduce the volatility of Cemex\\'s cash flow and our cost of capital,\" said Cemex Chairman and Chief Executive Lorenzo Zambrano. Cemex said it expects to see about $130 million in pretax annual cost savings by the third year following the acquisition. It expects the deal to immediately boost free cash flow and cash earnings per share. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions, including the acquisition of more than 90 percent of Rinker shares, Australian and U.S. regulatory approval and approval by Cemex shareholders. Cemex said it has obtained financing commitments to fund the deal. Citigroup ( C.N ) is Cemex\\'s lead financial advisor, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) is co-financial advisor.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to consider whether Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) should have to pay damages overseas for infringing a speech recognition software patent owned by AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) \\n\\n The high court granted Microsoft\\'s petition to review an appeals court ruling that held AT&T could seek royalties based on the foreign manufacture and sale of infringing software products. The Microsoft-AT&T dispute is one of the most important patent cases that will come before the court this year and could determine the reach of U.S. patents overseas, experts said. The case raises \"the question of how far downstream you can go in capturing damages in the chain of commerce,\" said Stephen Maebius, a patent lawyer with the firm Foley & Lardner LLP. At issue is a ruling last year that upheld a lower court decision that Microsoft was liable for infringing an AT&T patent for converting speech into computer code in copies of Windows sold overseas. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the world\\'s largest software maker was liable for the unauthorized distribution of codec technology, used to compress speech signals into data, in copies of Windows overseas. A year earlier, Microsoft settled most of the telephone company\\'s outstanding claims, and both agreed to appeal the unresolved issue over the distribution of the technology overseas, for which Microsoft said it was not liable. U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement of the Justice Department urged the high court to review the case. In a brief filed earlier with the court, he agreed with much of Microsoft\\'s argument and said the appeals court ruling \"improperly extends United States patent law to foreign markets\" and puts U.S. software companies at a competitive disadvantage. \"That disadvantage will harm the software sector of the American economy and could ultimately compel some software companies to relocate their research and development operations abroad,\" the government said in documents filed with the court. Maebius said patent holders \"are trying to stretch the distance of a U.S. patent to perhaps compensate for lack of patent protection in foreign countries.\" Microsoft had argued unsuccessfully before the appeals court that liability should not extend to products sold overseas because software is not a product \"component\" under U.S. patent law, and because copies of the software were made overseas, rather than in the United States. Microsoft issued a statement on Friday saying the case was \"not only important to Microsoft, but to the entire U.S. (information technology) industry.\" An AT&T spokesman said the company expects the high court will handle the case \"in the normal course of business. We look forward to their decision.\" The Supreme Court did not comment further on its decision to grant the review, except to say that Chief Justice John Roberts did not participate in the decision.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending will fall 1 percent next year, the first drop since 1991, a report said on Friday, led by a decline in home building as the housing market continues to cool. \\n\\n Home construction dominated the industry for the past five years. But the report, from Mcraw-Hill Construction, said building of single family home dwellings is expected to fall 15 percent in 2007. Single family home construction grew more than 10 percent in 2004 and 2005. \"The construction industry in 2006 is going through a transition,\" the report said. The Commerce Department reported Friday that the slumping housing sector helped slow U.S. economic growth in the third quarter to its weakest pace in more than three years. The report showed a 17.4 percent annual rate of contraction in spending on new housing in the period.  The McGraw-Hill report said home construction dropped sharply during the 1990-1991 recession, but that fall-off was not from the dizzying highs the market has seen in recent years. It said Americans will spend $268 billion on single family home construction in 2007 -- a 7 percent drop -- on 1.275 million dwellings. At the same time, commercial, industrial and institutional spending will increase, the report forecast. Hotel construction should hold steady at its 2006 level while institutional building will advance 7 percent in dollar volume. Manufacturing construction will rise 14 percent, while public works building will grow 5 percent, it said, noting that new ethanol plants will feed some industrial growth, along with electric utilities construction.',\n",

The median forecast of Wall Street economists polled by Reuters was for a final October reading of 92.5. \"The consumer is doing OK. The housing market is OK and the consumer has been helped by lower prices at the pump and energy prices, while the employment numbers are still good.

Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity but in recent years confidence measures have been a weak guide to actual spending. Expectations for inflation were virtually unchanged from September, the report said, according to the sources. The survey\\'s final October reading on one-year U.S. inflation expectations was 3.1 percent, up from a preliminary 2.9 percent, but unchanged from 3.1 percent in September. Median expectations for inflation over a five-year horizon were unchanged from early October at 3.1 percent but were fractionally higher than September\\'s 3.0 percent. Government bonds US10YT=RR were little moved by the data, with prices holding at higher levels after an early boost from surprisingly weak preliminary data on third quarter U.S. gross domestic product growth. The first reading of third-quarter GDP showed a 1.6 percent increase, falling short of an expected 2.2 percent rise and below the 2.6 percent advance of the second quarter. \"There is this exhaustion about which way the economy is going right now, or maybe it\\'s contentment that yields are where they need to be right now,\" said T.J.

       "  ' MINNEAPOLIS  (Reuters) - Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Gary Stern on Friday reiterated his support for the introduction of formal inflation targets by the U.S. central bank, a possible move that the Fed is expected to debate over the coming months. \\n\\n \"I am in favor of it,\" Stern said in a speech to the Missouri Valley Economic Association. Attainment of price stability should be the Fed\\'s primary objective, he said, and inflation targets would help to do that more explicitly by institutionalizing current practice. Targets would reduce uncertainty about how policy-makers would respond to any given situation in the economy, and would improve accountability, Stern added. Expectations of future inflation would also be better \"anchored\" by inflation targets, contributing to sound private-sector decision making, he said. Stern did not speak about the current economy or monetary policy, two days after the FOMC voted to keep benchmark interest rates steady at 5.25 percent for a third consecutive meeting. Stern is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2006. However, he is a member of a Fed task force, convened by Chairman Ben Bernanke, to examine a broad range of communications issues. The topic of formal inflation targets is expected to be one of the topics under review. The committee met for the first time this week. Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn chairs the committee, and  San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen is also a member. Inflation outcomes in countries that have introduced formal targets \"look quite promising,\" Stern said. Still, in response to a question from the audience, Stern said he doubted that Fed policy would have been \"significantly different\" over the last ten years had there been inflation targets. The Fed \"has had success\" on the inflation front, helping to create an \"extended period of low inflation\" since the mid-1990s.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A slumping housing sector helped slow U.S. economic growth in the third quarter to its weakest pace in over three years, leading financial markets to raise bets on interest-rate cuts next year. \\n\\n Gross domestic product, which measures total economic activity within U.S. borders, expanded at a 1.6 percent annual rate during the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. This was down from 2.6 percent in the second quarter for the slowest advance since the first quarter of 2003. The Bush administration insisted the soft GDP data, coming less than two weeks before the November 7 congressional elections, did not signal the economy was spiraling downward but only that it was moving to a slower and steadier growth rate. \"I\\'m feeling good about making this economic ... transition from an unsustainable rate to a more sustainable rate,\" Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said during a relatively rare meeting with print reporters in Treasury\\'s pressroom. Democrats expressed concern the economy was slowing at a time when workers were already struggling to keep up with inflation, a theme they have pressed on the campaign trail. Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi, in line to become Speaker if Democrats capture the U.S. House of Representatives, said growth in earnings was not keeping up with rising costs of health care, food and energy. \"By these measures, our economy is not nearly as strong as it should be,\" Pelosi said. The dollar sank to a one-month low against a basket of major currencies on the signs of softness. The risk that corporate profits might suffer in a slower economy also hurt stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  lost 73.40 points to end at 12,090.26 while the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  finished down 28.48 points at 2,350.62. But bond investors took heart at signs that slower growth might ease price pressures and keep interest rates on hold. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR gained 11/32 in price to 101-17/32 for a yield of 4.68 percent while the 30-year bond was up 20/32 in price at 95-1/32, yielding 4.80 percent. STILL SPENDING Consumers showed no sign that weakening housing prices were dampening their spirits. A survey from the University of Michigan indicated consumers were even more optimistic as the fourth quarter opened than previously thought. A final October reading of the University of Michigan\\'s consumer sentiment index came in at 93.6, up from a preliminary 92.3 and September\\'s final reading of 85.4, said sources who saw the subscription-only report. Economic growth in the third quarter was well below Wall Street forecasts for a 2.2 percent increase and reflected a range of influences that combined to slow the economy. The report showed a striking 17.4 percent annual rate of decrease in spending on new housing - the biggest decline in 15-1/2 years. In addition, growth in business spending on inventories slowed to only a $50.7 billion rate, subtracting 0.1 percentage point from GDP growth, and the value of imported goods accelerated sharply to a 7.8 percent annual rate of increase in the third quarter, more than three times the second quarter\\'s 1.4 percent increase. Analysts noted the data was old and that growth appears set to pick up modestly in the current fourth quarter. \"Housing took a toll on the economy but bear in mind this was last quarter, and the current quarter is on a growth pace that would double this number\" because of consumer spending, said economist Richard Yamarone of Argus Research Corp. in New York. The drag on growth from a rapidly softening housing sector had been expected, since other reports have shown prices are weakening for both new and existing homes. COMPANIES INVESTING By contrast, the GDP report showed business investment remained healthy and consumers picked up their spending pace. Nonresidential investment, which measures business spending, rose at an 8.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, close to double the second quarter\\'s 4.4 percent. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of national economic activity, increased at a 3.1 percent rate, up from 2.6 percent in the second quarter. So-called core prices excluding food and energy items -- an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches -- climbed 2.4 percent on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. But there were signs that price rises might be easing. In the third quarter, core prices advanced at a 2.3 percent rate after rising 2.7 percent in the second quarter.',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ), the No. 2 U.S. oil company, on Friday posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on improved margins at refineries and gas stations and high oil prices. \\n\\n Earnings at the downstream unit -- which includes its refining, gasoline sales at the pump and transportation businesses -- rose sharply from last year when the company was forced to shut its largest U.S. refinery after Hurricane Katrina. \"We\\'ve seen some excellent performance and high utilization at our refineries, and that contributed greatly to our financial results,\" Chief Financial Officer Steve Crowe said on a conference call with analysts. Net income in the quarter rose to $5.02 billion, or $2.29 a share, from $3.59 billion, or $1.64 a share, last year. The company said this year\\'s results include net charges of about $95 million. The average earnings forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates was $2.04 a share. Total revenue dipped to $54.21 billion from $54.46 billion last year. Earnings at the downstream unit rose to $1.44 billion from $573 million last year. The U.S. portion of that business performed especially well -- posting its best quarter in at least 6 years -- as its fuels refinery network operated at close to full capacity during the quarter, Chevron said. The downstream profit was well ahead of forecasts, according to James Halloran, an analyst with National City Private Client Group, which owns about 3 million Chevron shares. \"They\\'ve shown flashes of excellent performance in downstream, and this is one of them,\" he said. He said the company had disclosed decent refining margins through August, but that most companies\\' refining margins had narrowed in September. Chevron\\'s margins \"must have held out pretty well,\" he said. Profits from the San Ramon, Calif.-based company\\'s exploration and production operation rose to $3.5 billion from $3.32 billion last year. Chevron said worldwide production rose 6 percent to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, with much of that growth due to the company\\'s recent acquisition of Unocal. U.S. oil prices hit a record high of $78.40 a barrel in July and spent much of the third quarter hovering above $70 before retreating to around $60 as the summer driving season ended and geopolitical tensions eased. The average price for its crude oil in the United States was $63.98 per barrel up from $55.28 last year. Other oil majors also announced surging quarterly earnings this week. Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) posted a 6 percent gain on robust oil production and high crude prices. Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) said its underlying profit rose 21 percent and BP Plc ( BP.L ) announced a 58 percent rise, helped by asset sales. The high earnings provided critics of the U.S. majors with another conspicuous target charging that Chevron and others are gouging American consumers. Many are asking the U.S. government to impose a windfall tax on oil companies and repeal about $6 billion in tax breaks that Washington granted last year. \"Big Oil is reaping billions in unwarranted profits while consumers struggle with sky-high gasoline, heating and electric bills,\" Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said in a statement on Thursday. \"Consumers should be outraged, and the federal government embarrassed by its own inaction.\" Shares of Chevron rose 61 cents to $68.11 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They are up about 20 percent since the beginning of the year, just ahead of the Chicago Board Options Exchange\\'s oil index .OIX during the same period.',\n",
       "  ' HONG KONG/SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Shares in Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, which is raising up to US$21.9 billion in the world\\'s largest IPO, ended 15 percent higher in their Hong Kong debut on Friday after its stock sale generated huge investor demand. \\n\\n The debut values the largest Chinese lender, making the first simultaneous Hong Kong and mainland China listing, at about US$139 billion, ranking it fifth among global banks, behind JPMorgan Chase & Co and ahead of Mitsubishi UFJ China began listing its banks overseas last year, and all five mainland lenders trading in Hong Kong have drawn huge demand for their shares as investors downplay worries about the legacy of decades of state-directed lending. Yang Liu, managing director at Atlantis Investment Management, bought ICBC\\'s IPO shares as a play on the Chinese economy, a rising currency and growing middle class, despite her preference for China Merchants Bank and China Construction Bank \"It\\'s too big to be ignored,\" she said. The stock leapt as high as HK$3.63, or 18 percent above its offer price, shortly after the Hong Kong market opening, compared with an IPO price of HK$3.07, before closing at\\nHK$3.52. ICBC was the most active stock in Hong Kong, but fell short of expectations for a first-day gain of as much as 20 percent. \"It\\'s better than what the average investor expected, given the size of the offering,\" said Kent Yau, deputy research director at Core Pacific Yamaichi in Hong Kong. ICBC\\'s domestically listed A-shares, however, disappointed investors by ending with just a 5.13 percent gain to 3.28 yuan, compared with an offer price of 3.12 yuan. The Shanghai shares rallied early by 10 percent before easing. The Hong Kong debut was crimped by a 0.31 percent dip in the Hang Seng Index, which earlier on Friday hit a record high. BIG AND BIGGER ICBC raised US$19.1 billion and is expected to expand the offering to US$21.9 billion by exercising an overallotment option. The stock sale was the most popular in Hong Kong and China history, and unmet demand for shares, combined with a surging Hong Kong market and an offering priced at a discount to peers, helped lift its first-day trading performance. \"Investors foresee China\\'s economy maintaining 10 percent growth every year before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, so they\\'re buying mainland bank shares now to access that growth,\" said K.C. Chan, executive director at money management firm KDB International, which bought ICBC shares for its clients. The IPO, about 75 percent of which was sold to Hong Kong and global investors and the remainder in the mainland, surpasses Japan\\'s NTT Docomo, which raised US$18.4 billion in 1998, as the world\\'s largest share sale. \"This is the world\\'s largest IPO ever with the biggest ever subscription rate. That speaks volumes for the quality of the offer and for global investor confidence in China,\" said Damian Chunilal, president of Pacific Rim global markets and investment banking at Merrill Lynch, one of ICBC\\'s underwriters. Among its rivals, Bank of Communications trades 132 percent above its IPO price, while China Construction Bank and Bank of China are up 50 percent and 13 percent, respectively. On their Hong Kong debuts, Construction Bank closed flat and Bank of China ended up 15 percent. BILLIONS IN BAILOUTS China has scrambled to get its creaky banks into better shape ahead of increased foreign competition set to kick in at the end of this year under its World Trade Organization obligations. ICBC\\'s IPO attracted share orders worth about US$400 billion for the Hong Kong portion of its deal and 780.7 billion yuan (US$99 billion) for its domestic deal. That should hearten another mainland lender, China CITIC Bank, which plans to raise as much as US$2 billion in a Hong Kong and mainland share sale by early 2007. ICBC\\'s share sale was a bonanza for foreign institutional investors led by Goldman Sachs, which paid US$2.58 billion in April for about 16.5 billion ICBC shares -- a stake that is now worth US$7.45 billion. Allianz and American Express also bought stakes alongside Goldman that are now worth a combined US$3.5 billion. All three investors have three-year lockups on their shares. ICBC\\'s IPO values the lender at 2.23 times its forecast book value. By comparison, No. 2 mainland lender Bank of China trades at 2.35 times 2006 book, No. 3 China Construction Bank trades at 2.66, and No. 5 Bank of Communications trades at 3.04 times book. At the end of June, ICBC had total assets of 7.05 trillion yuan, 360,000 staff and more than 18,000 branches all over China. China\\'s \"Big Four\" state-run banks have received billions of dollars in government bailouts to help ease their bad loan woes. ICBC received a US$15 billion capital injection from Beijing in April 2005, helping lower its non-performing loan ratio to 4.1 percent as of June 30 this year, compared with Bank of China\\'s 4.2 percent and 3.51 percent for Construction Bank. ICBC\\'s investors will be rewarded with dividends of 45 to 60 percent of net profit for 2007 and 2008, compared with 35 to 45 percent for both Construction Bank and Bank of China. ICBC\\'s global IPO was sponsored by Merrill Lynch, China International Capital Corp. (CICC), ICEA, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank (US$1=HK$7.8=7.984 yuan) (Additional reporting by Rita Chang)',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK/TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange TSE.UL said on Friday it is discussing an operational tie-up with the New York Stock Exchange NYX.N. \\n\\n The move, which would combine the Big Board with Asia\\'s largest marketplace, comes amid a flurry of activity as U.S. exchanges seek a footprint in Asian markets. Earlier this month Nasdaq, NYSE\\'s biggest rival, signed cooperative agreements with the Korea Exchange and Tokyo-based Jasdaq. Under the proposed alliance between NYSE and TSE, the exchanges will take about 10 percent stakes in each other by 2009, Japanese financial daily Nihon Keizai said on Friday. The proposal also calls for the exchanges to establish a market for Asian start-ups, with the TSE overseeing their Asian strategy, in addition to cross-listing, the paper said. NYSE declined to comment, but analysts had long expected some combination between the two exchanges. Earlier this month, NYSE Chief Executive John Thain told reporters he was focused on an increased Asian presence and discussing a \"range of topics\" with TSE. An operational tie-up could make sense for both exchanges, said Sang Lee, managing partner of Boston advisory firm Aite Group. \"Assuming this refers to an exchange of ideas and technology, (the tie-up) would help TSE improve its overall infrastructure and certainly give NYSE a gradual footprint in Asia.\" A more overt takeover bid from NYSE would probably meet resistance from Japanese regulators, Lee said, noting \"in any country you always run into nationalist sentiments\". But if pressured by rival exchanges or domestic brokerages like behemoth Nomura Holdings, TSE could also be open to an overseas merger, Lee added. Asian inroads come as the Big Board hopes to soon complete its purchase of Paris-based Euronext ENXT.PA. The exchange expects shareholders to vote on that offer in December, NYSE executives said on a conference call on Thursday. (Additional reporting by  Aiko Hayashi  in TOKYO)',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fortune Brands Inc. FO.N, whose products range from Jim Beam bourbon to Moen faucets, on Friday reported quarterly profit below Wall Street estimates but affirmed its full-year outlook of double-digit earnings growth, sending its shares up slightly. \\n\\n Fortune, which also sells golf equipment and kitchen cabinets, said net profit for the third quarter rose to $151.3 million, or 98 cents a share, from $92.2 million, or 61 cents a share, a year ago, helped by acquisitions and a lower tax rate. Excluding special items, Fortune earned $1.30 a share from continuing operations, missing analysts\\' average estimate of $1.33 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts\\' expectations ranged from $1.28 a share to $1.41 a share. Excluding items in both quarters, Fortune said profit in the quarter grew 16 percent, in line with its stated target of double-digit growth. \"Each of our three businesses performed in line with what we expected,\" said Chief Executive Norm Wesley on a conference call, \"even as weakening new home construction impacted sales of windows and doors.\" Total net sales rose 23 percent to $2.22 billion, driven by a 46 percent increase in wine and spirits sales. Sales of home and hardware goods rose 18 percent, while golf product sales rose 7 percent. \"Even though there was pressure on (the home and hardware) side of the business it held up nicely,\" said Donald Gher, chief investment officer for Coldstream Capital Management, which counts Fortune Brands stock among its $1 billion in holdings. \"That was a nice surprise.\" Gher said the two negatives in the quarter were that earnings were boosted by a lower tax rate, and operating profit in the spirits segment, which grew 65 percent before charges, was a little below his expectations. Fortune, whose acquisition last year of more than 20 spirits brands places it among the world\\'s top spirits companies, said quarterly sales of its Courvoisier cognac and Canadian Club whiskey were hurt by changes in distribution. The company said it would spend more next year to market the brands, but that would not impact earnings. In the home segment, Gher guessed that investors were anticipating sales gains below the 18 percent increase Fortune posted. He said that segment, which includes Simonton windows, MasterBrand cabinets, and Moen faucets, benefits from a focus on replacement and remodeling products, which do not suffer as much from a slowdown in the building of homes. Fortune affirmed its full-year earnings target and said it expects fourth-quarter earnings per share to grow at a high-single-digit to low-double-digit rate, excluding items. \"While we expect the softening housing environment will create challenging comparisons for our home products brands through the first half of 2007, we believe that we will continue to outperform the broader home products market,\" said Chief Executive Norm Wesley. On a conference call with analysts, Wesley forecast that the housing downturn was likely to be steeper but shorter in duration than many have anticipated. \"We see the likelihood of a fairly rapid recovery in the housing market in the second half of 2007,\" Wesley said, assuming interest rates do not rise and consumers stay resilient. He said the company\\'s strategy was based on that timeline, but assured analysts that contingency plans were in place should he be wrong. \"If we\\'re wrong and sales are slower than we think, than we have already built into our expenses contingency that predicates that,\" Wesley said. \"We\\'ll deal with what we\\'re dealt and work very hard to outperform the market.\" Shares of Fortune, which also owns Sauza tequila and Maker\\'s Mark bourbon, fell 10 cents to $76.78 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, bringing them slightly below where they started the year.

       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. investment fund Steel Partners launched a $194 million tender offer for Japanese instant-noodle maker Myojo Foods Co. Ltd. on Friday, the second unsolicited bid for a Japanese company by a U.S. investor this month. \\n\\n Shares in Myojo were flooded with buy orders and ended untraded at 709 yen, 16 percent above Thursday\\'s close. Myojo executives said they were examining Steel Partners\\' offer but had not decided whether to endorse it. Once unheard of in Japan, hostile takeover bids are becoming less rare, although so far no major deal has succeeded. In September Oji Paper Co. dropped its landmark bid for smaller rival Hokuetsu Paper Mills Ltd., the first hostile buyout battle between blue-chip manufacturers. Steel Partners, which pioneered hostile bids in Japan with two failed attempts in 2004, is offering to buy the 76.9 percent of Myojo that it does not already own for 700 yen per share, a 14.9 percent premium to Myojo\\'s closing price on Thursday. The offer values the entire company at 29.8 billion yen ($251.8 million). By bidding Myojo\\'s shares higher than the tender price, some investors appeared to be hoping that Steel Partners would sweeten its offer. Last week, managers of machinery leasing firm Suntelephone Co. Ltd. declared their opposition to a $26 million tender bid from Dalton Investments LLC, another activist U.S. investor. Steel Partners had earlier proposed to bankroll a management buyout (MBO) by Myojo President Hironobu Nagano and other executives, but the executives declined. If they oppose the tender offer as well, Steel Partners would be forced to decide whether to continue with a potentially disruptive hostile takeover attempt. \"We believe our offer is attractive because it provides Myojo\\'s existing shareholders with liquidity and an opportunity to sell at a significant premium to the current market price,\" Steel Partners Chairman Warren Lichtenstein said in a statement. Steel Partners said it is happy with the performance of Myojo\\'s managers and hopes to keep them in place after buying the firm, though mending relations if they oppose the tender could be difficult. The 22.9 billion yen ($193.5 million) offer will close on November 27. Myojo, which is Japan\\'s fourth-ranked maker of instant ramen noodles, estimates a group recurring profit of 1.76 billion yen for the 12 months ended September 30, up from 1.24 billion yen the previous year.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Avon Products Inc. ( AVP.N ), the world\\'s largest direct seller of cosmetics, on Friday posted a 47 percent drop in third-quarter profit due to charges and said it would take more steps trim costs. \\n\\n The company, which said its restructuring is on track, outlined two additional cost-cutting moves -- reducing the number of products it sells by 25 to 40 percent and moving toward global purchasing. Those changes come almost a year after efforts like job cuts and increased advertising spending were first laid out. \"We continue to believe that the company\\'s turnaround will take a while and is not imminent,\" said Goldman Sachs analyst Amy Low Chasen, who rates Avon \"neutral.\" While the new plans are \"encouraging for the long term,\" they could lead to even higher near-term charges, she said. Avon shares fell 3.5 percent before rebounding slightly. Earnings fell to $86.4 million, or 19 cents per share, from $163.8 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Avon resolved a long-standing tax dispute in the United Kingdom, which led to a charge of $21 million in the quarter. Excluding that and another charge for inventory reductions, Avon earned 27 cents per share, topping Wall Street\\'s average forecast of 24 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating profit fell 32 percent to $168 million. Revenue rose 9 percent to $2.06 billion, exceeding analysts\\' average forecast of $1.98 billion, driven by a 16 percent rise in skin care sales and the acquisition of a licensee in Colombia in late 2005. \"Bulls can point to a revenue beat on previous low expectations and heavy advertising spending,\" said Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, who has a \"peer perform\" rating on Avon\\'s shares. \"Bears can point to that most key markets still look very bad, and only a few markets are driving growth.\" The company said its restructuring should yield nearly $100 million in savings this year. It still expects annualized savings of more than $300 million once the plan is fully implemented, with costs of about $500 million. NORTH AMERICA IS \\'WORK IN PROGRESS\\' The number of active representatives who sell Avon products like Anew and Skin so Soft rose 6 percent, but grew just 2 to 3 percent without Colombia, Avon said. In North America, representative ranks continued to fall, though the 2 percent decline was softer than the 6 percent drop in the first half of 2006. North American revenue fell 1 percent, as low-income shoppers still felt pressure from higher gasoline prices, but to a lesser degree than in the first half of the year. Operating profit plunged 70 percent. \"North America remains a work in progress,\" said Credit Suisse analyst Filippe Goossens, who rates the shares \"outperform.\" Latin America, Avon\\'s largest region, was the leading market with 28 percent revenue growth, aided by the Colombia deal. New York-based Avon has been cutting jobs and boosting advertising to lure back lower-income consumers who curbed purchases or defected to competitors\\' new skin-care products. Avon now plans to spend about $250 million on advertising this year, up from $135.9 million in 2005. Quarterly advertising nearly doubled to $66 million as the company promoted new products and the return of direct selling in China. The company sells its cosmetics and skin care products through representatives, rather than retailers. But China closed the door on direct sales in 1998; Avon just got approval to resume direct selling earlier this year. That change pushed quarterly revenue in China up 9 percent although Avon posted an operating loss of $3 million there. More than 236,000 people had registered with the Chinese government by the end of the quarter for the right to sell Avon products and the company said they were being trained. Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Pecoriello, who had expected sales growth of 40 percent or more in China, said the results suggest that productivity of the representatives is very low. Shares of Avon were down 77 cents at $29.29 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have risen just 2.5 percent so far this year, far below the 11 percent rise of the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index  .SPX , of which Avon it a member.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ingersoll-Rand Co. Ltd. ( IR.N ) on Friday reported disappointing quarterly earnings as demand fell for equipment used in home building and landscaping, and warned fourth-quarter earnings would miss analyst estimates. \\n\\n The diversified conglomerate, whose shares fell nearly 4 percent, said it saw a \"sharp deterioration\" in North American demand for compact equipment, such as Bobcat machines, and reported slower demand for road machinery and security products used in home construction. \"It\\'s a weaker number being affected by the economy, particularly the impact of the slowdown in the residential construction market,\" Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten said. The results came one week after Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings and slashed its 2006 and 2007 forecasts, citing slowing demand for its earth-moving equipment and high raw material costs. Ingersoll\\'s third-quarter net earnings dropped around 4 percent to $243 million from $254 million. Earnings per share rose to 76 cents from 75 cents, reflecting lower outstanding shares. The results included a previously announced tax charge of $27 million. Excluding the charge, profit totaled 85 cents a share, while analysts, on average, expected profit of 86 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue was up 6 percent to $2.77 billion, but below estimates of $2.84 billion. Ingersoll, whose products also include golf carts and store display cases, called the third-quarter performance \"unsatisfactory\" and said it is moving to cut costs and restructure businesses. Ingersoll forecast fourth-quarter net earnings of 70 cents to 75 cents a share, or earnings from continuing operations of 74 cents to 79 cents a share. Analysts, looking for 93 cents, were revising downward their estimates. \"(Ingersoll\\'s) miss and the lowered guidance is not a total surprise given last week\\'s report by Caterpillar,\" Bear Stearns analyst Ann Duignan said in a note to clients. \"The magnitude of the downturn in the compact equipment business, Bobcat, was however greater than expected.\" Bobcat sales slid more than 20 percent, and the overall compact vehicle segment posted lower sales, profits and profit margins. Chief Executive Herb Henkel said the company and its dealers were surprised by the speed and depth of the downturn. While Bobcat sales typically lag any dip in residential construction by as much as 13 months, there was no lag this time, Henkel told analysts on a conference call. Dealers cut orders sharply to reduce inventories, Henkel said, and the company is cutting production to match demand. When Bear Stearns\\' Duignan asked on the call whether the company could reach its target of double-digit 2007 earnings growth, Henkel said he could not give a simple yes or no answer. He said weakness in the compact vehicles segment will likely continue into the first half of 2007, but the climate control and industrial segments were strong. The company also needs to address raw material inflation, Henkel said, with costs rising much faster than Ingersoll had estimated. Longbow\\'s Lustgarten noted the U.S. economy appears to be growing at a more moderate pace, which translates into low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth, and earnings growth of 5 percent to 10 percent for the capital goods companies he covers. The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter, the government reported on Friday, far below the 2.6 percent pace in the second quarter and much weaker than economists expected. Companies with international exposure, like Ingersoll, are better positioned to weather the period of slower growth, which will last into the middle of 2007, Lustgarten said. Shares fell $1.43 to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange, after falling to $35.90, its lowest level since August 2. Ingersoll shares have lagged the broader market this year as well as other industrial stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor\\'s industrial machinery index .GSPINDM. The stock is down more than 24 percent from its 52-week high in May.',\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Shrunken bottles of Tide and other liquid detergents could hit stores across the United States and Canada as early as next year should a test being conducted by Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) go well. \\n\\n P&G just started selling concentrated bottles of liquid detergent in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to judge consumer reaction to the bottles, which are smaller but clean the same amount of clothing, and cost as much as traditional bottles. The test, which includes concentrated versions of Tide, Gain, Cheer, Era and Dreft, comes weeks after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) publicly called on suppliers to cut their waste. P&G\\'s test also follows the roll-out of a concentrated detergent by rival Unilever Group ( ULVR.L ) ( UNc.AS ) earlier this year. P&G said the test is set to last six months. Should results in Cedar Rapids prove positive, P&G plans to convert its entire liquid laundry detergent lineup in the United States and Canada to the new packaging starting in 2007, the Cincinnati-based company said in a statement. A bottle of the new concentrated detergent washes the same amount of clothing as a bottle of normal detergent but are about half of the size. The new bottles are made with up to 47 percent less plastic and have up to 45 percent less water than before, P&G said. The move comes more than two years after consumer packaged goods companies such as P&G began to feel pressure from higher raw materials costs, particularly for the plastic used in packaging. Some of those costs have started to abate now that oil prices have fallen. Wal-Mart, the world\\'s largest retailer, has indicated that decisions on which suppliers to use could partly hinge on compliance with its new plan, which calls for suppliers to cut the amount of packaging they use by 5 percent under a five-year plan scheduled to begin in 2008. \"This was more of a Wal-Mart mandate than a PG-led initiative, but if the changeover goes smoothly, PG, the retailer and consumer win,\" Deutsche Bank said in a note to its clients this week. The plan was already announced to local retailers, but P&G did not widely distribute the details. Brandweek, a marketing industry publication, disclosed the plan on October 16. P&G\\'s decision follows a move by Unilever to push its new \"all Small & Mighty\" product,\" a 32-ounce bottle of detergent that uses less than half the plastic of a 100-ounce container and cleans just as much.',\n",

Among the Dow\\'s biggest losers, Caterpillar topped the list and Wal-Mart was second. Intel and other semiconductor companies slid on the Nasdaq after a Goldman Sachs report said demand for \"motherboards,\" a key computer hardware component, is falling. The stock market pulled back after two weeks of gains. The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new closing record high in 13 of the past 18 sessions. For the year, the Dow is up about 13 percent so far. \"The stock market reaction is not a surprise,\" said Jason Schenker, U.S. economist at Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"We are coming from big gains, but the GDP report showed the economy is walking on a tight rope and obviously, if growth is going to slow, corporate profits may shrink as well.\" The Dow Jones industrial average slid 73.40 points, or 0.60 percent, to end at 12,090.26, its worst one-day drop in a month. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index fell 11.74 points, or 0.85 percent, to finish at 1,377.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 28.48 points, or 1.20 percent, to close at 2,350.62. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 had their worst one-day drop since September 6. Still, all three major U.S. stock indexes rose for the week. The Dow was up 0.7 percent, followed by a 0.6 percent rise in the S&P 500. The Nasdaq advanced 0.4 percent. Intel, the world\\'s largest chip maker, lost 3.1 percent, or 67 cents, to $21.10 on the Nasdaq. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. fell 3 percent, or 64 cents, to $20.86 on the New York Stock Exchange. Caterpillar\\'s stock fell 1.7 percent, or $1.08, to $61.27, while Wal-Mart\\'s shares slid 2 percent, or $1.02, to $50.73 on the NYSE. Before the opening bell, the government said GDP, which measures total economic activity within U.S. borders, expanded at an annual rate of 1.6 percent during the third quarter -- much slower than the 2.2 percent rate economists had expected and below the second quarter\\'s annualized rate of 2.6 percent. Shares of Ingersoll-Rand Co. fell 3.7 percent, or $1.45, to $37.45 after the diversified conglomerate posted lower quarterly earnings and said fourth-quarter results will fall bellow Wall Street\\'s expectations.. Still, Chevron Corp., the No. 2 U.S. oil company, rose after it reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on improved refinery margins and high oil prices. Its shares rose 0.3 percent, or 18 cents, to $68.14 on the NYSE.

       "  ' LOS ANGELES/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Chinese Internet media firm Sohu.com ( SOHU.O ) delivered a stronger-than-expected 6 percent rise in underlying quarterly profit and an upbeat outlook on strong advertising sales, sending its shares sharply higher. \\n\\n Total advertising revenue for Sohu.com Inc. jumped 27 percent from a year earlier to $23.9 million in the third quarter, driven by heavy spending from automobile and information industries. \"The brand advertising business will continue to do well, and also in the third-quarter they did better than their guidance and the consensus number as well, so it is quite positive,\" said Dick Wei, an analyst at JP Morgan. Company officials were upbeat about the outlook for the firm, which was named last year as official Internet content sponsor for the Beijing 2008 Olympics. \"We are now able to offer our advertising in a much broader range of products and inventory. That is a more important revenue growth driver,\" chief financial officer Carol Yu said, adding that advertising prices were rising. Sohu\\'s third-quarter net income rose to $8.54 million, or 22 cents per diluted share, from $8 million a year earlier, or 21 cents per share, the Beijing-based company said, excluding expenses related to stock options. The company said it expected fourth-quarter earnings of 20 cents to 22 cents per share, excluding expenses related to employee stock options. Including the expenses, third-quarter net income fell nearly 18 percent to $6.6 million, or 17 cents per diluted share. Third-quarter revenue stood at a record $35.4 million and it forecast fourth-quarter revenue to hold steady at $34 million to $36 million, despite the fee and subscription changes imposed by the country\\'s two mobile carriers which hurt its mobile services revenue. Analysts had been looking for fourth quarter guidance of between $32.2 million and $35.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares in the NASDAQ-listed company rose 6.3 percent to $22.54 and then added a further 4 percent to $23.51 in after-hours trade. ADVERTISING BUSINESS In July, the parents of listed China Mobile Ltd. ( 0941.HK ) ( CHL.N ) and China Unicom Ltd. ( 0762.HK ) ( CHU.N ) unveiled a spate of fee and subscription policy changes that analysts had expected would hurt new subscriber growth. However, Sohu said its wireless revenue only fell a marginal 2 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter and rose 31 percent from a year earlier to $8.8 million. \"Being able to achieve this is due to our vigilance in managing the wireless business and minimizing the risks of uncertainty and identifying new revenue sources,\" chairman and chief executive Charles Zhang said. Sohu, along with rivals Sina Corp. and NetEase.com Inc. ( NTES.O ), has been working to diversify revenues for the past two years as the market for their core wireless services has matured and mobile carriers squeeze commission rates. Now, Sohu hopes especially to rev up advertising ahead of the Beijing 2008 Olympics. Sohu continues to expand its online video content portfolio with new channels and exclusive content. It recently launched two new online TV-like channels, one for entertainment and the other for sport. It plans to launch an Olympic channel in early November, Zhang added.',\n",
       "  ' SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.\\'s ( MSFT.O ) recent undersubscribed tender offer shaved 4 cents off its earnings per share outlook for the full fiscal year ending June 2007, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said on Thursday. \\n\\n The company\\'s previous guidance had not included the effect of the undersubscribed tender offer. Liddell said the software giant plans to make up the 4-cent per share shortfall with better performance and additional buybacks. He also said Microsoft is \"confident\" it can meet its target to ship 10 million Xbox 360 video game consoles by the end of 2006 and that it expects the cost of the next-generation video game player to decline in the current quarter.',\n",
       "  ' SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) posted an 11 percent rise in quarterly net profit on Thursday, boosted by a strong performance at its database division and shrinking losses from its Xbox 360 video game console. \\n\\n The world\\'s largest software maker also said it will defer revenue of $1.5 billion related to the upcoming launches of a new Office software suite and Windows Vista, the first major upgrade of its operating system in five years. Including the effects of the deferral, which will reduce profit this quarter by 11 cents per share, Microsoft forecast second-quarter profit of between 22 cents and 24 cents per share on revenue of $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast second-quarter earnings of 36 cents per share on sales of $13.4 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. In after-hours trade, Microsoft shares rose to $28.50 from a close of $28.35 on Nasdaq. The revenue deferral stems from a coupon program announced this week to allow buyers of personal computers to upgrade to Vista and Office 2007 when they debut next year. \"People might be concerned that operating income may drop in the next quarter, but what\\'s happening is that they\\'re deferring revenues for an upgrade program to Windows Vista,\" said Toan Tran, an analyst with Morningstar. \"It really has no effect on the cash flow Microsoft has. It just won\\'t be recognized until the third quarter.\" The company also gave a full-year earnings outlook range of $1.43 to $1.46 per share on revenue of between $50 billion and $50.9 billion. Wall Street analysts have been looking for a full-year profit of $1.44 per share on sales of $50.3 billion. Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell told Reuters in an interview that the full-year outlook was stronger than it might first appear. A $20 billion tender offer for shares set for August was not fully completed, leaving a larger share base that would lower earnings by 3 cents per share more than previously anticipated, he said. But the company aimed to make that up with a better performance and other share repurchase programs. \"That\\'s primarily due to the fact that the tender was not fully subscribed, but we\\'re obviously very happy that we are able to maintain the range we previously had,\" Liddell said. \"The way I look at it, we are able to make up all of that shortfall.\" In its first quarter ended September 30, net profit was $3.48 billion, or 35 cents per diluted share, up 11 percent from $3.14 billion, or 29 cents per diluted share, a year ago. Sales rose 11 percent to $10.8 billion in the quarter. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings per share of 31 cents on revenue of $10.7 billion, based on Reuters Estimates. Microsoft posted sales and profit growth at its server and tools business, powered by a 30-percent year-on-year rise in sales of its database software platform, SQL Server, and solid demand for its Windows server software. The company also said it had sold 6 million Xbox 360 video game consoles since the launch last November, and losses at its entertainment and devices division shrank to $96 million from $173 million a year ago and $414 million the previous quarter. \"We\\'re progressively lowering the manufacturing costs of the console,\" Liddell said. \"So even for the ones we do sell, we are in a better shape from a loss-per-console perspective.\" He added that the number of games sold per Xbox rose in the quarter. While video game machines often sell at a loss, the games themselves are highly profitable. Microsoft shares have risen about 25 percent since June, hitting a near-two-year high on investor optimism that the much-anticipated Windows and Office upgrades will pay off. Microsoft is expected to launch Windows Vista and Office 2007 for corporate customers this quarter, and for retail consumers early next year. The two product lines comprise more than half of Microsoft\\'s revenue and almost all of its profit.

A source familiar with the situation told Reuters about the plan earlier this month, but Wal-Mart has declined to comment. \"We asked ourselves should we keep the emphasis on organic growth or take the risk of doing a large acquisition with all the problems and challenges of integration,\" Chief Executive Officer Jose Luis Duran said. \"We are more interested in organic growth, and we will not deviate from that.\" Duran was speaking to a small group of reporters during a business visit to China with French President Jacques Chirac. Sources have said Wal-Mart is planning to buy Taiwan\\'s Trust-Mart for $1 billion, which would more than double its presence in the world\\'s most populous country. Carrefour aims to open at least 20 hypermarkets, which sell food along with household items such as fridges and TVs, in China this year and beyond. It will open its 84th hypermarket on Saturday, which is its 7th in Beijing and 1,000th in the world. Duran said Carrefour had looked at buying Trust-Mart but that the company did not meet its criteria. TOUGH FRENCH FOURTH QUARTER Carrefour, the world\\'s second-largest retailer after Wal-Mart, was facing a difficult fourth quarter in France compared with the first nine months of this year, Duran said, but reaffirmed the financial targets for the group. \"The (French) market remains tough,\" he said. \"I think the last quarter will be hard. Why? Because there is tough price competition.\" Carrefour shares fell 1.8 percent to 49.53 euros by 0749 GMT in Paris, underperforming a little changed DJ retail index .SXRP. Some analysts were puzzled by the share reaction. \"Carrefour has consistently been taking a very cautious tone about this year,\" a London-based analyst said. \"They already warned of two fewer Saturdays this quarter and continued fierce competition from (privately held) Intermarche and Leclerc.\" Over the past quarters Carrefour\\'s performance in France, where it earns about half of its sales, showed a recovery following price cuts and promotions to win back shoppers, mainly to its key hypermarket stores, amid mounting competition. Apart from a negative calandar effect -- fewer shopping days -- a 15 percent drop in petrol prices compared with the year-ago period would dampen sales growth this last quarter, Duran said. Carrefour expects sales growth at constant exchange rates this year to exceed the 4.3 percent growth last year and that profitability growth will lag sales growth. It has forecast current operating profit and sales growth of about 10 percent by 2008. INDIA Market saturation and slowing growth at home is also drawing foreign retailers to India with its 1.1 billion population. But its government bars foreign retailers from directly investing in India forcing them to team up with local retailers. \"In India there are at least a good half a dozen candidates (for Carrefour to team up with),\" Duran said, declining comment on negotiations with local retailers. Indian conglomerate Bharti Enterprises Ltd confirmed talks were with Carrefour, Wal-Mart, and Britain\\'s Tesco ( TSCO.L ) and aims to pick a partner by the end of November. Carrefour is also in talks with Dubai\\'s Landmark Group about opening up to 200 stores in India, Landmark Chief Executive Micky Jagtiani said earlier this month.

Analysts on average had expected earnings of 75 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter revenue dipped to $503 million from $505.9 million, hurt by declines in boots and kids\\' shoes. The company\\'s sales have suffered as its signature work boots have fallen out of fashion with the mostly young, urban consumers who once embraced them. Timberland forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth in the mid-single digit percentage range, reflecting \"relatively flat\" U.S. growth and double-digit gains in its international business. For the full year, the company is now expecting earnings per share to show a decline in the 30 percent range. In July, it forecast a drop of about 25 percent. Last year\\'s earnings were $2.35 per share, excluding restructuring costs and other one-time items. Analysts on average were expecting profit of $1.74 per share for this year, according to Reuters Estimates. That would reflect about a 26 percent decline.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The stock options timing scandal, which has already implicated at least 140 companies, could include hundreds more, according to a new analysis that found lax enforcement of corporate governance reforms that should have prevented the practice. \\n\\n Investors have widely discounted companies\\' misconduct over stock options timing because they believe most of it pre-dates the Sarbanes-Oxley reforms on corporate governance of 2002 that were implemented in the wake of the Enron scandal. But a report released over the weekend from proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. showed that many firms may not have filed properly options timing paperwork as recently as 2005. \"We believe the backdating scandal may be entering its second act,\" Glass Lewis analyst Todd Fernandez said in the report. Backdating involves changing the day that stock options were granted to an earlier date when a company\\'s stock was trading at a lower price, potentially allowing company executives to lock in higher profits when they exercise their options. Beginning in August 2002, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission required companies to disclose their stock-option awards in Form 4 filings within two days of options grants to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley. Before that, companies did not have to report option grants for several weeks. The new regulations should have removed most opportunities for backdating. But Glass Lewis, in the report, said the SEC has not enforced the two-day filing rule, possibly leading to many more instances of backdating. More than 140 companies have launched internal reviews or are under government investigation over possible manipulation of stock option grant timing. But that number may grow as Glass Lewis said an analysis of late Form 4 filings showed \"hundreds\" of companies may have, intentionally or mistakenly, backdated grants after the 2002 reforms. \"When rules are not enforced consistently, they often are not followed,\" Fernandez said. \"When we find late Form 4 filings where the price of the underlying stock increased materially between the purported grant date and the day the Form 4 was filed, we believe this raises legitimate questions about whether the grant was backdated.\" The SEC could not be immediately reached for comment. Companies have said that many of the late Form 4 filings were unintentional -- a result of sloppy paperwork-- and their options grants have been accounted for correctly. The chairman of one of the companies mentioned in the Glass Lewis report, Medis Technologies Ltd. MDTL.O, told Reuters that Medis had been late in some of its Form 4 filings but did not engage in backdating of options. \"For some reason they fell through the cracks,\" Robert Lifton, chairman and chief executive officer, of Medis, a fuel cell technology company, said of several late Form 4s the company filed from 2004 through 2005. \"Our attorneys and our auditors have checked it and rechecked it and there was no backdating,\" Lifton told Reuters. \"We filed them late and we, ourselves, disclosed it in our proxy statement.\" Glass Lewis also raised concerns about late Form 4s that could have resulted in higher profits for executives at Hansen Natural Corp. HANS.O, O\\'Reilly Automotive Inc. ( ORLY.O ), Digital River Inc. ( DRIV.O ), American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. AHM.N, Websense Inc. WBSN.O, Silicon Image Inc. ( SIMG.O ), and Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Inc. ( KERX.O ). A spokesman for Websense, Cas Purdy, said, \"The late filings were unintentional and we filed the appropriate forms when we became aware of it.\" The other companies could not immediately be reached for comment. Children\\'s Place Retail Stores Inc. ( PLCE.O ) was also mentioned in the report as having been late in filing Form 4s after August 2002. The company earlier this month said it expects to restate financial results for the past three fiscal years and the first quarter of the current year due to errors in the dating of stock options. In several cases Glass Lewis said the Form 4s were repeatedly filed late, raising questions about the quality of internal controls over financial reporting at those firms.',\n",
       "  ' SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia\\'s Rinker Group RIN.AX said on Monday a US$12 billion takeover bid from the world\\'s third-ranked cement maker, Cemex, materially undervalued it and shareholders should take no action. \\n\\n Mexico-based Cemex CEMEXCPO.MX ( CX.N ), which operates in 50 countries, offered $13 per share cash. The unsolicited bid also includes taking on $860 million of Rinker Group Ltd.\\'s debt. The bid, which represents a premium of more than 20 percent to Rinker\\'s closing price on Thursday -- before talk of a takeover began to lift the stock -- comes as a slumping housing sector helped slow U.S. economic growth to its weakest in over three years. \"The proposed offer is opportunistic and materially undervalues the company,\" Rinker Chairman John Morschel said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on Monday. Rinker shares are due to open at 11:00 a.m. (0000 GMT). The deal would increase Cemex\\'s dominance in U.S. cement as 80 percent of Rinker\\'s earnings come from the United States, open the door in Australia and give it a foothold in China, where Rinker has four plants. Analysts said that Cemex, or perhaps other potential bidders for Rinker such as larger rival global cement companies Lafarge ( LAFP.PA ) and Holcim ( HOLN.VX ), or perhaps CRH Plc ( CRH.I ), would have to raise the offer to be successful. \"Rinker is deserving of a premium multiple. Cemex will obviously need to raise its offer to appease Rinker shareholders,\" said a report from Robert Norfleet, analyst at Davenport Equity Research. \"Being bought is the likely outcome of this ordeal. That withstanding, we understand (Rinker) management\\'s ... reluctance as this offer comes at a time when conditions in Rinker\\'s markets are difficult with multiples having compressed in the face of a challenging operating environment,\" he said. The Cemex bid price values Rinker at an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple of 9.2 times, based on earnings reported for the 2006 fiscal year. The bid announcement drove Rinker\\'s New-York traded ADRs up 33.15 percent to close at $71.10, putting them at about a 9 percent premium to the Cemex bid price, and suggesting the market expects a higher offer. Rinker\\'s ADRs represent 5 ordinary Rinker shares. The Australian shares had already jumped 5.8 percent to close at A$14.70 earlier on Friday. The stock traded as high as A$21.44 in April. Cemex said it expects around $130 million cost synergies a year, before tax, by the third year following the acquisition of Rinker, a figure Norfleet said was \"extremely conservative.\" Rinker has appointed UBS as its financial advisers.

       "  ' LA PAZ, Bolivia  (Reuters) - Bolivia\\'s leftist president, Evo Morales, took a key step forward in his bold plan to nationalize the country\\'s gas and oil industries on Sunday after foreign energy companies agreed to operate in the country under state control. \\n\\n Major energy firms including Petrobras and Repsol YPF ended months of talks with the government with last-minute agreements before a deadline set for midnight Saturday, agreeing to new contracts handing over a larger share of their profits to the Bolivian state. The deals amounted to a political boost for Morales, the country\\'s first indigenous leader, who has faced criticism for months that the process had been slow-moving and clouded with uncertainty. \"With these new contracts we want to generate more economic resources to solve the economic and social problems of our country. That\\'s our great wish,\" Morales said during a signing ceremony attended by company executives. A nationalization decree issued by Morales on May 1 gave foreign companies six months to negotiate new contracts handing over a majority stake in their Bolivian operations or abandon the country. Brazil\\'s Petrobras ( PETR4.SA )( PBR.N ) and Spain\\'s Repsol YPF ( REP.MC ) are the biggest investors in Bolivia\\'s oil and gas industry, controlling 47.3 percent and 26.7 percent of the proven and probable natural gas reserves in the country. Petrobras, Brazil\\'s state-owned oil company, also pledged to invest $1.5 billion in Bolivia\\'s energy industry after agreeing to operate in the country under state control, Juan Carlos Ortiz, the head of Bolivia\\'s state-owned energy company YPFB, told Reuters. On Friday night, France\\'s Total ( TOTF.PA ) and U.S-based Vintage became the first companies to comply with the nationalization. Although specific details of the new contracts have not been revealed, the government has said they are designed to give YPFB more control over production and commercialization of oil and gas products. The government has also said new contracts would contain a clause requiring energy multinationals to invest part of their profits in the country\\'s energy sector. According to the new deals, the companies will now operate as service providers to Bolivia\\'s YPFB in exchange for between 18 to 50 percent of the revenue. Morales, wearing his trademark striped sweater, said the agreements will quadruple Bolivia\\'s energy revenues over the next four years from a current $1 billion. He also sought to assure companies their operations would be protected by the law. \"What we are doing here is to exercise our property rights, as Bolivians, over our natural resources, without evicting any one, without confiscating,\" he said. The Bolivian leader insists he wants to use the energy revenue to help alleviate poverty in South America\\'s poorest country. NEW CONTRACTS Some energy companies with smaller interests in Bolivia, including British gas and oil producer BG Group Plc ( BG.L ), Amoco, which is controlled by British Petroleum ( BP.L ), and the Argentine companies Pluspetrol and Matpetrol also signed new contracts. A major campaign pledge by Morales, the drive to assert greater state control over Bolivia\\'s gas and oil fields has suffered a series of setbacks in recent months, including resignations of key officials, prompting analysts to say the nationalization was flailing. A lack of technical expertise and funds at YPFB also slowed the government\\'s efforts to take over Bolivia\\'s natural gas reserves, the second largest in South America after Venezuela\\'s. The government had been locked in arduous talks for months ahead of the deadline, particularly with Petrobras. Brazil is the biggest buyer of Bolivian natural gas and Petrobras has invested more than $1.5 billion in oil and gas exploration and exploitation in recent years. The nationalization \"has assured significant investments, put the most important is the recovery of our sovereignty over our natural resources,\" YPFB President Juan Carlos Ortiz said.

       "  ' HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Hong Kong tycoon Henry Fok Ying-tung, whose business and political influence and close ties to Beijing earned him the nickname \"the Godfather\", has died in the Chinese capital aged 83, China reported on Sunday. \\n\\n The official Beijing Youth Daily cited sources confirming his death but gave no details. Hong Kong\\'s Sunday Morning Post said he had been suffering from cancer. Fok, a vice chairman of the Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), died at Peking Union Medical College Hospital on Saturday evening, the Post said. Long seen as one of the Hong Kong figures best connected in Beijing, Fok was a trusted confidant of many mainland leaders. Born in 1923 at Panyu, in Guangdong province which borders Hong Kong, Fok rose from humble roots to become one of the city\\'s wealthiest and most powerful men. Stories of his colourful past abound, including gun-running for the Communists during the 1950-53 Korean War and his passion for sport, especially soccer. In 1993, with Hong Kong still under British colonial rule, Beijing made Fok a vice chairman of the CPPCC, the Chinese parliament\\'s main consultative body, putting him in the same league as the country\\'s most senior leaders. Only one other Hong Kong citizen, former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, holds an equivalent position. Fok\\'s power-broking credentials were underlined before Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, when he was reported to have introduced Tung to then Chinese President Jiang Zemin, paving the way for the low-key shipping magnate to become the territory\\'s first leader under Chinese rule. Almost a decade earlier, Fok had backed a $120 million fund to bail out Tung\\'s struggling business. \"PATRIOTIC CAPITALIST\" Fok\\'s journey into Beijing\\'s political inner sanctum began half a century ago during the Korean War, when he defied a United Nations embargo to smuggle vital medical supplies, including penicillin, into mainland China. It was also widely claimed, though never proven, that he smuggled guns over the border to further the Communist cause. His patriotism was generously repaid. The Communists granted him various business monopolies, including export of sand for construction, which all but guaranteed his fortune. He became known in Beijing as the \"Patriotic Capitalist\". In 2006, Forbes magazine ranked him the 181st most wealthy man in the world, with an estimated net worth of $3.7 billion. His business empire includes property, ports and casinos in the former Portugese enclave of Macau. Despite the trappings of power and wealth, the younger Fok could often be found playing street football with the territory\\'s top players on downtown concrete pitches. In 1970 he flew the Brazilian team Santos, including star player Pele, to Hong Kong for an exhibition match -- an event which caused a great sensation in the city. Fok was active in charitable work through the Fok Ying Tung foundation which he founded in 1984. In 2005, he donated a little over $100 million to a local university.',\n",

The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was conducting an\\ninvestigation into whether UBS was involved in improper\\nmanipulation of Treasury securities prices.  UBS\\'s share price fell 1.2 percent in early trading but was\\nlater trading 0.89 percent below Friday\\'s close.  The newspaper said a Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) bond trader,\\nThomas Brown, had left the firm amid regulatory scrutiny.  A spokesman for Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) declined to comment\\non the reported departure of a U.S. bond trader in such\\ncircumstances.  \"We are not commenting on this. It concerns an individual\\nnot the institution,\" said a Credit Suisse spokesman.  The report comes after warnings in recent months by James\\nClouse, U.S. Treasury deputy assistant secretary, and Treasury\\nUndersecretary Randal Quarles, over a rise in instances of firms\\ntrying to profit from controlling particular Treasury\\nsecurities.  The Treasury was especially sensitive to trading in the \\nmarket for its bonds because it depends on selling these\\nsecurities to raise cash to fund the budget deficit while the\\nFederal Reserve uses treasury securities to conduct monetary\\npolicy, the Journal said.  The New York Federal Reserve has called for a Nov. 6 meeting\\nwith primary dealers to discuss issues the U.S. Treasury\\nDepartment has raised about questionable trading practices.  One analyst said he wondered whether it was possible for\\nanybody to manipulate the U.S. Treasuries market in view of its\\nsize. \"It\\'s a $4 trillion market. How can you manipulate such a\\nmarket?\" said the Zurich-based analyst, who requested anonymity.  Others said UBS was likely to go to great lengths to protect\\nits reputation because of its large wealth management business.  \"UBS is obsessed with its reputation for integrity because\\nof the private banking,\" said an analyst with a major\\ninternational bank in London.  The Journal reported that Credit Suisse\\'s bond trading was\\nbeing scrutinised by regulators, citing a person familiar with\\nthe matter, but said it was not clear which federal agency was\\nconducting the investigation.

Sysco said the accounting change, which led to a loss of\\n$39.7 million, stemmed from corporate-owned life insurance\\npolicies that it took out on \"key individuals\" to fund\\nobligations under nonqualified executive retirement plans.  Stripping out that one-time loss, earnings were 37 cents\\nper share, beating by a penny the average forecast of analysts\\npolled by Reuters Estimates.  Shares of Sysco rose slightly in trading before the market\\nopened.  Sysco has suffered in recent months from soaring fuel\\ncosts, which rose $9 million during the quarter. However, it\\nsaid pension costs had fallen $14 million and stock-based\\ncompensation costs had declined by $11.7 million.  Sales rose to $8.67 billion from $8.01 billion. The company\\nsaid it had gained market share by increasing sales at a faster\\npace than the industry.  Sysco has been reviewing thousands of its food distribution\\ncontracts to find ways to boost sales.

       "  ' \\n  (Adds CEO and CFO comments, closing share price)      By  Marcel Michelson       PARIS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - French electrical equipment group Schneider Electric ( SCHN.PA ) said on Monday it had agreed to buy American Power Conversion APCC.O (APC) for about $6.1 billion in cash at $31 a share to grow in uninterrupted power supply.      APC was under pressure from a shareholder, Matrix Asset Advisors Inc, to sell itself because its share price did not reflect its intrinsic value. The price represents a 30 percent premium to APC\\'s closing share price of Oct. 27.      Reuters data show Schneider is paying 36 times expected 2007 earnings per share and 2.44 times the expected 2007 sales of APC.       Schneider will finance the deal with a 4.5 billion euros  ($5.71 billion) syndicated loan, a share capital increase via a rights issue of some 1.2 billion and through the issue of bonds.      Schneider\\'s stock closed 7.2 percent lower at 82 euros, following a 7.8 percent gain so far this year, underperforming a 0.7 percent drop in the DJ Stoxx industrial index .SXNP.      Analyst Olivier Esnou at Exane BNP Paribas said that at 30 times expected 2007 earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), the deal was \\'very expensive\\' and the timing looked poor.      \"Achieving a return will require turning around APC\\'s large UPS business,\" he said. \"But Schneider has little track record in turnarounds, and may be pursuing growth at too rapid a pace.\"      The group said the takeover, based on an enterprise value of about $5.5 billion, would make it a global leader in the market for critical power services, which ensure uninterrupted power supplies to data centres and production facilities.       The acquisition was expected to result in value creation in excess of $3 billion arising from a turnaround in large uninterrupted power supply systems, strong complementarity with Schneider\\'s MGE UPS Systems subsidiary, and synergies with Schneider Electric\\'s product offering.      It estimated synergy benefits of some $220 million, of which 70 percent would be achieved by 2009, and an increase in earnings per share from 2007, meeting Schneider\\'s criteria for three-year return on capital employed for acquisitions.      Deutsche Bank analyst Martin Wilkie said the acquisition made sense if synergies could be achieved.      STRATEGIC MOVE      Chief Executive Jean-Pascal Tricoire called the acquisition \"a significant strategic move\", allowing Schneider to become stronger in its fastest growing segment -- electrical distribution.      At a news conference, he ruled out a similar-sized acquisition in the near future. \"Our strategy is to make medium sized acquisitions to complement our growth platforms,\" he said.      Commenting on the financing of the takeover, Chief Financial Officer Pierre Bouchut said the company would still have \"room for manoeuvre in the next two to three years ... to allow for external growth ... to continue to make acquistions ... of 500 to 800 million euros a year\".      Lazard and Merrill Lynch & Co. are financial advisers to Schneider Electric, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP is legal counsel. Goldman Sachs & Co. is financial adviser to APC and Clifford Chance US LLP is legal counsel.   APC said in September it was cutting 4 percent of its global workforce, or about 330 jobs, as part of an ongoing cost-cutting programme. Combined with previously announced cuts, the company has plans to reduce about 7 percent of its work force.  In July, the company said that second-quarter net profit fell 41 percent as expenses rose.

Operating profit, dented by a month-long strike, fell by nearly a third to 183.2 billion won. \"The drop in third-quarter earnings was not because its sales were sagging, but the limited supply due to strikes failed to meet demand,\" said Kang Sang-min, analyst at Tongyang Investment. Hyundai, which makes the Sonata sedan and Santa Fe SUV, booked an 18.9 billion won ($20 million) loss from derivatives linked to Kia, versus a 134 billion won profit a year earlier, according to a company official. Kia\\'s third-quarter saw its first net loss since Hyundai bought into the company in 1999, hit by higher marketing costs. Kia is seen under more pressure amid intense competition in a weaker domestic market, although some analysts see some hope with its higher-end models such as the Opirus sedan. Hyundai shares fell 1.58 percent to 74,900 won by 0447 GMT, underperforming the broad index\\'s  .KS11  1.03 percent drop. Kia was off 1.03 percent.

The won on average rose 7.8 percent versus the dollar in July to September, but eased 0.5 percent from April-June. Hyundai\\'s third-quarter sales fell 4.3 percent to 5.89 trillion won as sales volume from local plants fell 6 percent. Hyundai Motor said the strikes cost the company 1.3 trillion won, or 93,882 vehicles in lost output.

However, Sony expects losses at its game unit to nearly double from its initial estimate to 200 billion yen ($1.71 billion) for the year to March after it cut the price of a PS3 with a 20-gigabyte hard disk drive by 20 percent in Japan. The bad news for the company continued last week when it posted an operating loss of 20.83 billion yen for July-September due to the mounting cost of recalling millions of computer batteries, in sharp contrast to a profit surge at rival Nintendo Co. 7974.OS thanks to its DS handheld game machine. However, Stringer said he was confident the performance for PS3 would be better in its second year when sales of higher margin software begin to increase. \"I think the idea of worrying about a delay in PlayStation is slightly strange to me. Every complex technology runs the risk of delays,\" said the executive. \"The point really is that PlayStation 3 is already finished and has been tested in America and has been deemed a creative success.

       "  ' SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian building materials firm Rinker Group RIN.AX rejected a US$12 billion takeover bid from cement maker Cemex CEMEXCPO.MX ( CX.N ) as inadequate, and its stock soared as much as 29 percent as investors bet on a higher offer. \\n\\n Mexico-based Cemex, the world\\'s third-ranked cement maker with operations in 50 countries, offered $13 (A$17) cash per share on Friday in what would be the biggest takeover ever by a Mexican company. \"We think we are fully valuing what Rinker is worth,\" Juan Pablo San Agustin, Cemex\\'s senior vice president of planning and finance told a conference call in Sydney on Monday, adding he didn\\'t think there would be a rival bid. \"Regarding intentions by other people to jump in, we don\\'t think that will be the case, no, because we think our offer is fully attractive to Rinker\\'s shareholders,\" he said. Buying Rinker, which derives 80 percent of its earnings from the United States, would solidify Cemex\\'s dominance in the U.S. market, open the door in Australia and give it a foothold in China, where Rinker has four plants. Australian shares of Rinker, which had already jumped 6 percent to A$14.70 on Friday, shot to a high of A$18.90 shortly after trade resumed on Monday. They were last trading at A$18.52, up 26 percent. The bid -- which represents a premium of 23 percent to Rinker\\'s closing price on Thursday -- comes as a slumping U.S. housing sector slowed U.S. economic growth to its weakest in over three years in the third quarter. Rinker Chairman John Morschel said Cemex\\'s proposed offer was \"opportunistic and materially undervalues the company.\" The board advised shareholders to take no action. Analysts said Cemex, or perhaps other potential bidders such as larger rival global cement companies Lafarge ( LAFP.PA ) and Holcim ( HOLN.VX ), or CRH Plc ( CRH.I ), would have to raise the offer to be successful. \"Rinker is deserving of a premium multiple. Cemex will obviously need to raise its offer to appease Rinker shareholders,\" said a report from Robert Norfleet, analyst at Davenport Equity Research. \"Being bought is the likely outcome of this ordeal. That withstanding, we understand (Rinker) management\\'s ... reluctance as this offer comes at a time when conditions in Rinker\\'s markets are difficult with multiples having compressed in the face of a challenging operating environment,\" he said. U.S. SLOWDOWN Cemex\\'s San Agustin acknowledged the difficulties in the U.S. market. \"We think the Florida market will continue to decrease over the next year, then maybe will be flat the second year and will begin to see some recovery over the third and fourth year,\" he said, citing a UBS report predicting a 20 percent fall this year in housing starts in Florida. Shares in Rinker had retreated from a high of A$21.44 hit in April, in line with the U.S. slowdown. \"The company\\'s waning share price made them vulnerable to a hostile bid,\" said Norfleet, who described Rinker as \"a world-class operator with extremely attractive assets, end markets, and a history of excellent financial performance.\" The Cemex bid price values Rinker at an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple of 9.2 times, based on earnings reported for the 2006 fiscal year. Goldman Sachs JB Were analyst Matthew McNee said transactions in the sector had averaged a multiple of 8 between 1997 and 2006. \"While the Cemex bid would seem to value Rinker at the top end of this range, we believe it significantly undervalues the company with Rinker offering Cemex significant potential synergy benefits,\" said McNee, who said Cemex would likely need to raise its bid to more than A$20 a share. \"Its exceptionally strong market positions in high growth markets are unmatched,\" he said. Cemex said it expects around $130 million in cost synergies a year, before tax, by the third year following the acquisition of Rinker, a figure Norfleet said was \"extremely conservative.\" The bid announcement drove Rinker\\'s New-York traded ADRs up 33.15 percent to close at $71.10, putting them at about a 9 percent premium to the Cemex bid price. Rinker\\'s ADRs represent 5 ordinary Rinker shares. Shres in fellow building materials groups also rose, with James Hardie Industries NV ( JHX.AX ) gaining 5.7 percent to A$8.03 and Boral Ltd. ( BLD.AX ) stock, which had fallen 3.8 percent on Friday after a profit warning, rebounding 1.3 percent to A$7.27. Rinker has appointed UBS ( UBSN.VX ) as its financial adviser. ($1=A$1.30)',\n",

       "  ' BALTIMORE, Maryland  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is on solid enough ground to withstand further interest rate hikes if the Federal Reserve has to curb stubbornly high inflation, Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker said in a speech on Monday. \\n\\n \"The economy is resilient enough right now to withstand further tightening,\" he said, adding that this comes despite the slowdown in the housing market. Lacker, who has had the lone dissenting vote on the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s last three decisions to keep rates on hold, said his outlook for inflation is \"discomforting.\" \"The longer inflation remains elevated, the more difficult it will be to bring it back down,\" he said. \"If the Fed allows inflation to remain above target for too long, expectations could become tightly centered around a higher rate. This danger is what prompted me to vote at recent FOMC meetings for tactics aimed at bringing inflation down more rapidly,\" he said. Lacker has been a stalwart supporter for more interest rate increases, even after the Fed raised the federal funds rate to 5.25 percent from 1 percent in the last two years. The core PCE price index, widely seen as the Fed\\'s favored gauge of price pressures, rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate in September, down a touch from 2.5 percent in August, according to data released on Monday. The boom in housing was driven by fundamental factors that are still quite favorable, and that while some further retrenchment seems likely in the housing market, that pullback is not likely to result in a \"catastrophic collapse,\" he said. Lacker also characterized the prospect for consumer spending as positive, driven by his outlook for higher income. Since the August policy meeting when the Fed injected some uncertainty into the market by keeping rates steady, financial market participants have weighed every phrase from policymakers for clues on the path of interest rates. Lacker said policymakers should do more to clarify the Fed\\'s strategy and objectives. Markets in turn should pay more attention to strategy rather than what the Fed\\'s policy actions will be. \"Instead of (financial markets) focusing on what choices we are going to make, our communications might be more usefully focused on our strategy and our objectives,\" Lacker said in answer to a question after a speech.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - For home owners dreaming of making improvements, environmentally friendly changes are the top choice, according to a survey released on Monday by Wells Fargo. \\n\\n Given $50,000, some 24 percent of those surveyed \"dream green\" and would purchase insulation, double-paned windows, solar panels and energy-efficient appliances, according to the bank\\'s third annual U.S. homeowners study. Twelve percent of those surveyed wanted state-of-the art chef\\'s kitchens, and 11 percent sought luxury master bedroom suites or master baths. Wells Fargo expected that the first choice would be for improvements that would only be aesthetically pleasing or add size or value, said Doreen Woo Ho, president of Wells Fargo\\'s consumer credit group, in a statement.  \"However, we found that Americans are showing signs of becoming more environmentally aware and want to take actions that save money, help preserve the environment, as well as add value to their home,\" she said. Younger homeowners in Generation Y, aged 18 to 29, are more likely than Baby Boomers aged 42-60 and War Babies aged 61 and older to view real estate as an important investment option. \"This survey shows a shift in the traditional mindset that the home only offers comfort and security for the future. It\\'s now considered a major part of homeowners\\' financial portfolios,\" said Woo Ho. The study also found that one in seven homeowners had adjustable-rate mortgages. ARM holder were skewed more heavily to younger borrowers. More than half, 56 percent, said they would refinance when their interest rates adjust upward, while 21 percent said they planned to take no action. Women were more likely than men, by a 3-to-2 ratio, to say security is the most important benefit of owning a home. By the same ratio, men were more likely than women to see the home as an investment. Ninety percent of owners expect their home value to stay the same (27 percent) or increase (63 percent) over the next 12 months. \"This survey finding suggests that homeowners are seeing the conditions of their local housing markets and concluding that it is more likely that price declines will be moderate, not steep,\" Woo Ho said. \"There is a divergence of opinion among housing market experts today on how much prices might adjust,\" she said, adding that the survey data give credence to \"the view that we\\'re more likely to have stability over time.\" The Wells Fargo survey was conducted by market research firm ICR of Media, Pennsylvania, and polled 1,361 homeowners selected to mirror the U.S. public by gender, age, region, race and education.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. consumers, helped by bigger paychecks and lower gasoline prices, boosted their spending last month, according to a government report that may counter fears of a sharp economic slowdown. \\n\\n The Commerce Department said on Monday that personal income rose by 0.5 percent in September, ahead of analysts\\' forecasts for a 0.3 percent gain. The August figure revised upward to 0.4 percent. Taking out inflation and taxes, real disposable income rose at its fastest pace in a year in September at 0.8 percent, helping to pad consumer spending at a time when concerns are growing about the economic impact of the housing slump. The growth in income coincided with falling gasoline prices, which pushed down headline consumer prices by 0.3 percent in September. The report \"was positive in almost every major dimension that is critical for the sustainability of the business expansion,\" said Brian Bethune, U.S. economist for Global Insight Inc. in Lexington, Massachusetts. The report came just days after the government said third quarter gross domestic product rose a scant 1.6 percent in the third quarter, but it did not provide encouragement for investors hoping the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates soon. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell largely in reaction to comments on Monday from Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker that inflation was still too high. Stocks rose on a steep drop in oil prices and a brighter corporate profit picture. The Commerce Department said personal spending rose 0.1 percent in September, slightly below analysts\\' forecasts for 0.2 percent increase. But adjusted for inflation, consumption spending rose a solid 0.4 percent after a surprise fall of 0.1 percent in August. Wages and salaries increased 0.5 percent after a 0.2 percent rise in August. At the same time, the personal saving rate as a percentage of disposable personal income improved to a negative 0.2 percent from negative 0.5 percent the month before. This was the best rate since May 2005, but it was the 18th consecutive month in which consumers spent more than their disposable income. INFLATION DECELERATES U.S. consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, rose by an expected 0.2 percent in September, showing some deceleration from the 0.3 percent increase for August. Compared with a year earlier, the index showed an increase of 2.4 percent, just below August\\'s 11-year high of 2.5 percent. While that figure slipped a notch, it remained well above the Fed\\'s historical comfort zone of 1 percent to 2 percent. Some analysts expressed relief that core inflation was decelerating, but others warned that the report was not likely to tip the Federal Open Market Committee toward cutting interest rates. \"I, like a number of FOMC members, will remain nervous about prices until I see a slowdown that looks more definitive and persistent,\" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. \"The jury is clearly still out, and the Fed has every reason to sit on their hands until the economic and/or inflation situations change significantly,\" Stanley said. Just as the data were released, the Richmond Fed\\'s Lacker said core inflation was running at an unacceptable rate on a long-term basis and the outlook for prices was \"discomforting\". \"The longer inflation remains elevated, the more difficult it will be to bring it back down,\" he said, adding that the economy was \"resilient enough right now to withstand further tightening.\" Investors for weeks have been trying to gauge when the Fed is likely to begin cutting rates again. \"The PCE numbers show and Lacker shows that this obsession with a rate cut is very premature,\" said Lara Rhame, senior currency strategist with Credit Suisse in New York.',\n",

Target shares closed Monday up 30 cents at $58.86, but rose as much as 1.3 percent to $59.65 in after-hours electronic trading after Berkshire disclosed the stake. J&J shares closed down 47 cents at $67.70, and were little changed after-hours. Regulators sometimes let Berkshire delay disclosing some holdings so investors can't mimic Buffett while Berkshire is adding to its portfolio. Berkshire is expected next month to disclose its stock holdings as of September 30. A Berkshire spokeswoman declined to comment. Based on reported shares outstanding, the Berkshire stakes account for 0.6 percent of Minneapolis-based Target's stock and 0.8 percent of New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J's stock. Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett, the world's second-richest person, prefers investing in industry-leading companies with stable, easy-to-understand businesses and strong management, and whose shares appear undervalued.

The fund would exclude investment in real estate at least initially, Elias Mendoza, IBM\\'s managing director of corporate development for Asia-Pacific, told a news conference in Beijing. \"I think where our collaboration would be able to add the least value is in the real estate market,\" Mendoza said. \"From an IBM perspective, we feel probably more comfortable contributing to industries that are in the operational and management and technology (fields), where they can take advantage of that more than the real estate sector can.\" Christopher Manning, a managing director of Lehman Brothers in private equity, said Lehman had investments in property in China through other funds and the exclusion of real estate from this one did not suggest the bank was negative on the sector. Manning named health care, consumer products, financial services and communications as sectors in which the fund had already begun reviewing opportunities. Except for real estate, start-ups and very small companies, all options were open. Typically, he said, the fund would aim to take 10-20 percent stakes. Private equity firms have been pouring into China, attracted by the country\\'s 10 percent growth rate.

The reinsurer, which has a stock market value of about $1.4 billion, said Robert Cooney resigned as chairman and chief executive officer and that Cooney would be available on a consulting basis until December 31, 2006. Max Re said its board appointed W.

Max Re said it expected the restatement would reduce retained earnings at June 30, 2006 by not more than $10 million, or 17 cents per share. The company said it now believed, subject to a review by auditors KPMG, that its net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $25 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, and $120 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, respectively.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. homeowners aspire to be greener and plan to spend more on home improvements as they favor staying in their existing homes, Doreen Woo Ho, president of Wells Fargo\\'s consumer credit group, told Reuters in a recent interview. \\n\\n Homeowners will spend now on environmental improvements that cut costs later, with spiking oil and gas prices fresh in mind. \"Everyone is more environmentally conscious. It\\'s creeping into all sorts of decisions, and we think that consumers are catching that message too,\" Woo Ho told Reuters on Wednesday. But owners also want state-of-the art kitchens and bathrooms, and are sensing that borrowing rates are stabilizing -- or even headed lower -- after two years of Federal Reserve interest rates hikes. These are some findings from Wells Fargo\\'s third annual U.S. homeowner survey.  Woo Ho, who is based in San Francisco, was in New York to discuss the study and accept a U.S. Banker magazine award as one of the 25 most powerful women in banking. COCOONING, IMPROVING The housing market has been undergoing a dramatic shift, as the double-digit annual price surges of the first five years of the decade have given way to slower price appreciation or declines in some regions. \"I think we all anticipate that the increase in values in the future is not going to be as rapid as in the past,\" said Woo Ho, who oversees a $98 billion portfolio of home equity, personal credit lines and loans as well as student loans. \"The idea is that you didn\\'t make a mistake unless you think you have to flip, and then, yes, you\\'re at great risk.\" Eighty percent of those surveyed by Wells Fargo said they had no regret about buying their current home. \"Consumers are still feeling good about values, which is good, because if everyone was panicking right now I think that would only cause a more dramatic shift in the market,\" said Woo Ho. Steadier interest rates, incentives to be greener, and a costly housing market that makes trading-up daunting all point to greater spending on home improvements. The survey also found that a vast majority of owners are happy with their location, even if they do not own the home of their dreams. They are more likely to improve than to move. Baby boomers are also moving near their childhood homes, due to aging parents or just getting back to their roots, she said. \"If you\\'re going to be closer to your family and friends, thinking of spending more time at home, the quality of the environment is more important. ... You want the space, the kitchens, the bathrooms, the bedrooms,\" she said. \"That cocooning instinct is going to spur home improvement.\" EDUCATION Looming large for the industry also is a massive wave of interest-rate resets on adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs. Between $1.1 trillion and $1.5 trillion of ARMs are eligible to be reset next year, and most will do so at much higher interest rates or will be refinanced to other loan products, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. But the survey found that just 61 percent of ARM holders recalled their reset dates. \"I think we\\'re as much in the business of giving education and advice as we are in giving people money,\" Woo Ho said, especially amid the rapid innovation of loan products with varied risk levels. \"We would certainly, from a marketing standpoint, be notifying them way in advance to give them the refinancing options,\" aiming to keep the borrower\\'s business, she said.',\n",

The stock \"is reflecting a little bit less enthusiasm then it was going in.\" FTN Midwest analyst Peter Costa said Humana\\'s forecast for Medicare enrollment growth next year also might have disappointed investors. Humana stands apart from other large U.S. insurers for its big bet on Medicare this year, when private companies took on a greater role in administering benefits for the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.

Analysts were expecting $3.50. \"Even though the earnings guidance for next year was strong, people were hoping for a strong number, and to some extent, you probably have people selling on the news,\" FTN Midwest\\'s Costa said. Heupel said the share drop also could reflect investor concerns about the future role of companies in administering Medicare, ahead of next week\\'s U.S. Congressional elections that could leave more power in the hands of Democrats. Humana Chief Executive Mike McCallister said on a conference call with analysts he didn\\'t think anything will happen in 2007 or 2008 \"from a real change perspective,\" regardless of the outcome of the elections. As Medicare encounters budget problems, McCallister said, \"All of the things we\\'re doing are going to be valuable to anyone trying to manage health care costs.

Enrollment in its stand-alone Medicare plans that cover just prescription drugs -- new in 2006 -- reached 3.52 million, up 62,200 from the second quarter. Wachovia analyst Matt Perry said in a research note that the earnings miss stemmed from disappointing results at Humana\\'s \"Complete\" plan, which offers the widest benefits of the company\\'s three stand-alone drug-coverage plans.

With fast-food restaurants under increasing criticism that they contribute to obesity and the risk of heart disease, KFC joins hamburger chain Wendy\\'s International Inc. in cutting out artery-clogging trans fats. Many local governments, including New York City\\'s, are looking at banning trans fats. KFC said using the new oil would mean there were no trans fats in any of its fried foods -- about 65 menu items in the United States, comprising 80 percent of its menu. The company is also working on removing trans fats from items such as biscuits, which are not fried. KFC restaurants in many other countries, including China, already use a more healthful oil. \"And if they don\\'t already use (the zero trans-fat cooking oil), they\\'re working on it now,\" said company spokeswoman Laurie Schalow. McDonald\\'s Corp., the world\\'s largest restaurant chain, promised in 2002 to reduce trans fats in some of its products. While the chain has introduced healthier foods -- such as apple and walnut salads -- it has yet to convert its oils entirely, saying it has not found an alternative that works as well. KFC said that after a two-year trial of various cooking oils, it settled on low linolenic soybean oil, a zero trans-fat cooking oil, to replace partially hydrogenated soybean oil in its U.S. restaurants. Since the new oil is also made from soybeans, it \"preserves the taste profile,\" according to KFC President Gregg Dedrick. The Canadian restaurants will switch to a Canadian-made canola oil, with the change complete by early next year. KFC has already quietly begun using the healthier oil in several hundred restaurants in New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and its hometown, Louisville, Kentucky. Dedrick said consumers have not been able to tell the difference. He declined to say whether sales had been affected at the converted stores. KFC is working with several suppliers, including Monsanto Co., a leader in genetically altering crops. Monsanto representative Christopher Horner said in an interview that more than 90 percent of the soybeans in the United States are genetically modified, but this particular low-linolenic trait was developed through conventional breeding. As demand for non trans fat oil has soared, Monsanto quintupled its production of soybeans this year from last, to 500,000 acres. In 2007, it expects to triple production to more than 1.5 million acres. The U.S. food industry in general and many fast-food restaurants in particular have been under growing pressure to offer more healthful products because of an increase in obesity in the country, especially among children and adolescents. \"The fast-food industry as a whole has been under some pressure to make this change, so it is really in their benefit to be proactive,\" said Arun Daniel a senior analyst at ING Investment Management, which owns about 600,000 Yum shares. But, at least in the near term, any increase in customer traffic at KFC is likely to be offset by the cost of making the change, he said. \"If anything, it could impact them negatively on the margins,\" Daniel said. Dedrick said the investment to find and convert to the new oil had been factored into the company\\'s business model, so it would not be taking any charges. He said KFC would not raise menu prices and expected the price of the new oil to come down over time as supply and demand even out. Yum, which also owns the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Long John Silver\\'s fast-food chains, said the other chains were exploring similar moves. Trans fat increases the low-density lipoprotein -- the so-called bad cholesterol -- in food. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration made it mandatory to list the trans-fat content of all food products, starting last January 1. Yum shares closed up $1.14, or 1.9 percent, at $60.10 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The stock has risen 25 percent so far this year.

The No. 2 U.S. telephone carrier will report along with a handful or other companies, including insurer MetLife ( MET.N ) and construction-materials maker Vulcan Materials ( VMC.N ). By 1050 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening losses of between 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1.

The personal-income and spending report will give investors clues on the strength of the U.S. economy and inflationary pressures. The data should also help the Federal Reserve decide whether it should continue to hold interest rates. \"With the U.S. economy apparently slowing much quicker than many would have liked, the Fed will still hold off easing whilst inflation is at current levels,\" Slaney said. \"The risk is very much on the upside on the core PCE figure. The last thing the markets want is the increased threat of prolonged stagflation.\" Investor will also likely pay close attention to comments by Chicago Fed President Michael Moscow and Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker for clues on U.S. monetary policy. The highlight of the week for investors will be U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday. Before then there will be action at the micro end of the economy, with more earnings reports and continuing news of or speculation about takeover activity.

       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), which is in talks to go private, on Monday forecast strong fourth-quarter radio advertising sales and posted a 9.5 percent drop in third-quarter profit, reflecting the spinoff of its entertainment unit. \\n\\n The largest U.S. radio operator did not comment on talks with private equity groups interested in buying the company. Clear Channel has said only that it is considering strategic alternatives, but sources have said discussions are at an advanced stage. Radio broadcasting revenue was up 5 percent to $962 million in the third quarter, fueled by higher national advertising and outpacing the industry as a whole thanks to the auto, retail and entertainment categories. Outdoor advertising revenue rose 8 percent to $720 million. Company officials on a conference call said fourth-quarter radio revenue, a key indicator of advertising sales, is currently pacing up 8.8 percent, compared with analysts\\' forecasts of 4 percent to 5 percent. Clear Channel said profit fell to $185.9 million in the third quarter from $205.5 million a year earlier, when $33.6 million of earnings came from operations no longer part of the company. Clear Channel last year spun off its concert promotion business, now called Live Nation Inc. Per-share earnings were unchanged at 38 cents because of a decrease in shares outstanding. Revenue increased 7 percent to $1.79 billion. The earnings per share met Wall Street expectations on a net basis and were a penny ahead, excluding some items, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue had been targeted at $1.8 billion by analysts. Profit before discontinued operations rose 8 percent to $185.9 million, Clear Channel said. Clear Channel\\'s stock was unchanged at $34.70 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock climbed 10 percent last week as buyout speculation swirled and the company confirmed it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives. Company officials forecast fourth-quarter outdoor advertising would rise 9.2 percent in its Americas division, which includes operations in both North and South America, and would be flat in its international division. Two private equity consortia are looking into making a bid for Clear Channel, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters last week. Analysts estimate an offer could approach $40 per share. Analysts widely believe the buyout groups are particularly interested in the outdoor advertising business, since the radio sector faces increased competition from new technologies like iPods, the Web and satellite radio. \"Clear Channel Communications results were in line (with expectations), but outdoor was stronger ... highlighting our belief that private equity interest is more focused on outdoor,\" said Jonathan Jacoby, analyst with Bank of America. Kit Spring, analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus, said, \"Billboards would be the crown jewel of the company because these private equity folks look out three to five years. You can count on the billboard company\\'s cash flow, while radio is a little more questionable.\" \"Part of Clear Channel\\'s radio acceleration is due to easy comparisons to a year ago and also because Clear Channel is taking (market) shares from their peers,\" he said. In 2005, San Antonio, Texas-based Clear Channel bet on a strategy of cutting back commercial air time to boost ratings and prices. Radio sales dropped initially but have resumed rising in recent quarters. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg  in New York)',\n",

The South Korean consortium, led by Korea Resources, Daewoo International Corp. ( 047050.KS ), Keangnam Enterprises Ltd. ( 000800.KS ) and STX Corp.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Monster Worldwide Inc., parent company of the leading jobs Web site, said on Monday its founder, Andrew McKelvey, had resigned from its board of directors after refusing to be interviewed for the company\\'s internal stock option investigation. \\n\\n McKelvey also stepped down as Monster\\'s chairman emeritus, a position he assumed after giving up the chief executive and chairman jobs earlier this month amid the options review. Shares of Monster rose more than 3 percent on the news. McKelvey, Monster\\'s largest individual shareholder, declined to be interviewed on Monday for the probe as scheduled and would not say if or when he would meet with them, his attorney said in a letter to the law firm investigating the issue for Monster. McKelvey\\'s attorney, Steven Reich, also said the 71-year-old executive was jet lagged, recovering from illness and was unprepared when he spoke to the company in July on the options issue. One attorney who specializes in boardroom matters said McKelvey\\'s exit was the only option. \"In this case, when you have a board member who is going to refuse to talk, his only responsible choice really is to resign,\" said Mary Ann Jorgenson, a partner at law firm Squire Sanders & Dempsey in Cleveland. \"I understand that he has legal issues, but the world, the market, would certainly consider it a negative situation for him to remain as a director,\" she added. More than 140 companies have internal investigations under way or are the subject of federal probes into possible manipulation of stock option dates. With so many companies under scrutiny, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is relying to some extent on internal company reviews when deciding whether to investigate further. The results of in-house probes are being handed over to the SEC, which reviews the findings. In the letter to Monster\\'s law firm, Reich, who was recently hired, canceled the Monday meeting between McKelvey and a board committee formed to address the backdating issue, citing a need for more time to study documents. Reich also said McKelvey misunderstood questions he was asked by company officials in the July meeting, did not have an attorney with him and had not taken the time to reconstruct events spanning many years. In March, McKelvey was hospitalized for pneumonia. \"In looking back on that session, it is now clear to Mr. McKelvey that he did not express his thoughts and recollections as clearly or accurately as he would have liked,\" Reich wrote in the letter, a copy of which was filed with the SEC. Reich said McKelvey was asked questions in July that he understood were meant to assess whether people in the company had improperly backdated stock options and whether he knew such actions were improper when they occurred. \"In retrospect, he recognizes that he misunderstood your questions and focused too narrowly on the issue of whether he knew at the time that improper conduct had occurred, and not on the more general issue of whether backdating had occurred,\" Reich wrote about McKelvey. \"During the time period relevant to your questions, he did not understand that it was improper for the exercise price of stock options to be different than the price on the grant dates, nor did he understand that there were legal or accounting implications associated with that difference,\" Reich added. In July, New York-based Monster said it might restate financial results for the year that ended December 31, 2005, and prior years to record additional noncash charges for stock-based compensation expenses relating to various stock option grants. Monster suspended its general counsel in September pending the internal review and on October 9 named William Pastore, 58, its CEO after McKelvey resigned as CEO and chairman. Shares of Monster rose as high as $41.60, and were still up $1.29, or 3.2 percent, at $41.58 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.

       "  ' PHILADELPHIA/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merck & Co. Inc. on Monday said it agreed to acquire biotechnology firm Sirna Therapeutics Inc. for $1.1 billion in cash to gain a stronger foothold in the promising drug-development technology of RNA interference. \\n\\n Merck ( MRK.N ) agreed to pay $13 per share for Sirna RNAI.O -- more than double Monday\\'s Nasdaq closing stock price of $6.45. After the stock market closed, shares of Sirna nearly doubled in extended trading to $12.67. Shares of the stock doubled during several minutes of after-hours trading following the announcement and before Nasdaq halted trade. Sirna has been working to create a new class of medicines based on RNA interference technology and has shown \"great promise\" in the area of cancer research, Merck said. \"RNA interference is a hot area of drug development, although it will probably take another five years for any significant drug using the technology to gain visibility,\" said Mehta Partners analyst Shaojing Tong. He speculated Merck was buying Sirna more for its know-how than its few early-stage experimental drugs. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is the molecule that transmits the genetic information encoded in DNA. By using chemically altered double-stranded RNA molecules as drugs, the technology is meant to block production of proteins linked to an array of diseases -- including cancer, hepatitis C and respiratory ailments. Merck has an ongoing drug-development partnership with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( ALNY.O ), which many analysts consider the leader in RNA interference because of its large number of patents. But that partnership suffered a setback last year when Alnylam suspended development of its experimental drug to treat the leading cause of blindness. Alnylam cited competition from other recently approved treatments for the condition, the \"wet\" form of macular degeneration. Sirna\\'s lead product, now in mid-stage trials, is attempting to fight the same eye condition. The drug, Sirna-027, is being studied as part of a collaboration with Allergan Inc. ( AGN.N ) into diseases of the eye. Sirna also has a strategic alliance with GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK.L ) for the development of compounds for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Sirna also has programs in areas such as infectious diseases, metabolism, and dermatology, Merck said. Earlier this month, Americans Andrew Fire and Craig Mello won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discovery of RNA interference. Focusing on RNA interference technology has given Sirna a novel approach to discovering drugs with the potential to produce highly specific, potent, and long-lasting effects, Merck said. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2007.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc. on Monday posted a higher quarterly profit on strong wireless growth, but shares fell as Internet subscriber additions disappointed some analysts, and higher expenses underscored concerns about its costly high-speed network project. \\n\\n Analysts said Verizon Wireless\\' subscriber growth had exceeded their high expectations, but growth in high-speed Internet customers was weaker than expected amid fierce competition from cable operators. \"One of the specific disappointments is the lack of strong growth in broadband Internet subscription, although overall the results were good,\" said Albert Lin, an analyst at American Technology Research. Verizon\\'s ( VZ.N ) third-quarter income excluding some special items rose to $2.0 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $1.8 billion, or 66 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Wall Street on average expected earnings before items of 66 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Including special items such as pension settlement charges and costs related to the merger and integration of MCI, it reported quarterly earnings of 66 cents per share, compared with 67 cents per share in the same quarter a year earlier. Verizon Communications\\' third-quarter operating revenue rose to $23.3 billion, up 25.8 percent year-on-year. Verizon said it added 448,000 net high-speed Internet connections, which include digital subscriber lines (DSL) and the more advanced fiber-optic lines, known as FiOS. Some analysts said they had expected around 500,000 net additions. Some analysts also said the 7.5 percent fall in domestic wireline subscriptions was higher than expected. Shares in Verizon, the second-biggest U.S. telephone company, fell 3 percent to close at $37.65. They had risen 30 percent since the start of the year on expectations of growth in FiOS Internet and television services. FiOS CONCERNS Analysts were also concerned about spending on FiOS, the fiber-optic network for Internet and television services, although most agreed the investment was needed for long-term growth amid declining traditional phone subscribers. FiOS TV, together with Verizon\\'s Internet and phone services, is also aimed at competing against cable operators\\' all-in-one packages of video, Internet and phone services. Verizon said it had 118,000 FiOS TV customers by the end of the third quarter, exceeding its target of 100,000. It said last month it expects to attract 175,000 TV customers by year-end. It expects FiOS to cut earnings by between 31 cents and 32 cents a share for full-year 2006, compared with its previous forecast of 28 cents to 30 cents. Chief Financial Officer Doreen Toben said FiOS will hurt earnings by the same amount in 2007. The company, like its bigger rival AT&T, has benefited from strong growth in mobile phone subscriptions in the past few years, as traditional phone line users decline. Verizon Wireless, of which Verizon owns 55 percent, added 1.9 million net customers in the third quarter, bringing the total to 56.7 million customers. The market had expected 1.7 million in net additions, according to a Reuters survey of nine analysts. Verizon Wireless revenues grew 18.2 percent to $9.9 billion, the company said. Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ) holds the remaining 45 percent stake in the wireless venture. \"It was a very strong quarter for wireless. I wouldn\\'t want to minimize that importance. It\\'s just that wireless strength was somewhat expected,\" said A.G. Edwards analyst Kent Custer. Some analysts cited worries about slowing U.S. economic growth as an overhang on the stock after data on Friday showed third-quarter GDP grew at its slowest pace in over three years, although Toben said she had not seen an impact. \"I know what the GDP numbers say but companies have strong earnings. At the moment, we\\'re bullish,\" she told Reuters.',\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hospital chains Tenet Healthcare Corp. ( THC.N ) and Triad Hospitals Inc. ( TRI.N ) on Monday each said they had a disappointing quarter, blaming the impact of unpaid medical bills largely stemming from the rising numbers of patients without health insurance. \\n\\n Tenet, the second-biggest U.S. hospital chain, forecast a third-quarter loss steeper than Wall Street expected, citing unpaid medical bills and fewer patient visits. Triad said profit fell 14 percent, after earlier this month shaving its forecast by nearly 20 cents per share. Tenet shares fell about 11 percent, while Triad shares fell about 1 percent, both on the New York Stock Exchange. The rising toll of unpaid medical bills has been eating into hospitals\\' profits in recent years and is taking up a bigger chunk of revenue. Bad debt is rising as the number of people in the United States without health insurance climbs. More than 46 million people -- or about 16 percent of the U.S. population -- lack medical insurance. \"I\\'d like to tell you guys that we\\'ve got this thing under control ... but I can\\'t do that,\" Triad Chief Executive Officer Denny Shelton told analysts on a conference call. \"I know there are a lot of people out there that say \\'why can\\'t you collect?\\' This is a U.S. healthcare issue. It is not a Triad issue.\" Most hospital companies this quarter cited the unyielding toll of bad debt as marring profit in quarterly results. Most analysts had forecast that bad debt trends would not improve, but they hoped they would at least stabilize. \"Underlying trends are probably about as bad or worse than we thought,\" SG Cowen analyst Kemp Dolliver said. The warning by Tenet, which has restated several years of earnings amid government investigations and shareholder lawsuits in recent years, \"undermine the optimist view that they could get a turnaround going in this environment,\" Dolliver said. Dallas-based Tenet forecast an operating loss of 5 cents to 7 cents per share. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates forecast, on average, a loss of 2 cents per share. It forecast a net loss of $82 million to $92 million, or 17 cents to 20 cents per share. Tenet said unpaid medical bills as a percentage of revenue grew to 16.4 percent in the third quarter from 14.9 percent a year earlier. Tenet said admissions in the third quarter fell 3.3 percent from a year earlier, excluding 10 hospitals the company has up for sale. The company, which will release full results on November 7, owns 66 hospitals, in California, Texas and throughout the Southeastern U.S. Publicly traded hospital companies run about 15 percent of the approximately 4,800 hospitals in U.S., with the remaining privately held, nonprofit or government-owned. While bad debt and the uninsured impacts all hospitals, the publicly traded companies are feeling the effects to a greater degree, in part because they are concentrated in states with greater rates of the uninsured, including Texas and Florida, according to analysts. TRIAD Plano, Texas-based Triad said net income fell to $39.8 million, or 46 cents per share, from $46.3 million, or 53 cents a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were 47 cents a share, in line with its estimate when it trimmed projections earlier in October. Triad, which owns 52 hospitals mostly in the South and Eastern U.S., was spun off of No. 1 hospital company HCA Inc. ( HCA.N ) in 1999. HCA in July agreed to a $21 billion buyout from private equity groups, excluding debt. CEO Shelton repeated his comments that the company continues to be in discussions with private equity firms, but that he would prefer to remain a public company. \"There is nothing imminent. It is a dialogue that is going to continue,\" he said. Still, he added, \"I have met with two or three groups that I\\'ve been real impressed with.\" Admissions were a bright spot in Triad\\'s results, rising about 3.7 percent, though margins contracted. Medical debt rose to 11.1 percent from 7.3 percent a year ago. Triad will recommend approval of a share repurchase program of up to $250 million at its board meeting November 2. Triad shares fell 43 cents to $37.39, while Tenet shares fell 89 cents to $7.41.',\n",

Visteon, which completed a bailout by former parent Ford\\nMotor Co. ( F.N ) in 2005 and announced a further three years of\\nrestructuring in January, slashed its full-year earnings\\nforecast and said it expects negative free cash flow this\\nyear.  In September, the company warned that second-half results\\nwould be pressured by automakers\\' production cuts and a shift\\naway from sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks toward\\nsmaller vehicles. It expects conditions to remain challenging\\ninto 2007.  \"The results were not surprising, given Ford\\'s problems,\"\\nMorningstar analyst John Novak said. \"They are obviously in a\\nrestructuring mode here, so I think people were expecting a\\ntough quarter.\"  Visteon\\'s net loss narrowed to $177 million, or $1.38 per\\nshare, in the third quarter, from $207 million, or $1.64 per\\nshare, a year earlier.  Analysts, on average, expected a loss of 79 cents per\\nshare, according to Reuters Estimates.  The net loss included $14 million of restructuring expenses\\nthat qualify for reimbursement from an account established in\\nthe Ford deal to fund restructuring.  The company\\'s restructuring makes comparisons with\\nyear-earlier figures difficult, and those issues will continue\\nfor several years, Fitch Ratings Managing Director Mark Oline\\nsaid.  \"Given the pressures in the environment and the production\\ncuts at major customers, they will be challenged to reverse\\nthat (negative cash flow) in 2007,\" Oline added.  Visteon reported third-quarter sales of $2.62 billion,\\nincluding $133 million from services. Analysts expected $2.56\\nbillion.  Product sales to Ford totaled $1.09 billion, or 44 percent\\nof the total, down from 64 percent a year earlier.  JOB CUTS  The 900 white-collar job cuts will be made in high-cost\\ncountries such as the United States, Visteon said. The cuts\\nrepresent 5.6 percent of the company\\'s 16,000 salaried jobs,\\nand 13 percent of the salaried jobs in high-cost countries.  The Van Buren Township, Michigan, company has about 46,000\\nemployees worldwide.  Visteon expects to take a charge of up to $65 million in\\nthe fourth quarter for the job cuts, which should qualify for\\nreimbursement from the restructuring account. It said it\\nexpects the cuts to save up to $75 million a year.  In a conference call, executives said Visteon advised\\nemployees of the planned cuts on Monday. It expects to complete\\nmost of the cuts by the end of the 2007 first quarter. The cuts\\ndo not include salaried workers leased to Ford.  In 2005, Ford agreed to buy back 23 Visteon facilities that\\nemployed thousands of high-wage union workers, and to help fund\\nadditional Visteon restructuring.  In January, the auto parts maker outlined plans to deal\\nwith 23 more facilities. So far, it has closed five, expects to\\nclose one more, and plans to retain one. It has received bids\\non four facilities it wants to sell.  In the third quarter, Visteon added plans to close its\\nChicago facility and exit its Vitro Flex glass joint venture.  The deal with Ford cut Visteon\\'s revenue by about 40\\npercent, and the company has narrowed its focus to interiors,\\nclimate control and electronics, where new business is\\nconcentrated.  Visteon cut its 2006 outlook for earnings before net\\ninterest expense, income taxes and extraordinary items and\\nexcluding unreimbursed restructuring costs and impairment of\\nlong-lived assets.  It said it now expects earnings on that basis of $40\\nmillion to $50 million, down from an August forecast for $170\\nmillion to $200 million.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - UAL Corp. UAUA.O, parent of No. 2 U.S. carrier United Airlines, on Tuesday posted a third-quarter profit, but shares fell as some experts considered the ongoing threats to the industry. \\n\\n The No. 2 U.S. airline reported earnings of $190 million, or $1.30 per share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $1.77 billion. The profit, UAL\\'s second since emerging from bankruptcy in February, initially sent the airline\\'s stock to a nearly six-month high. But shares later fell as much as 3.5 percent. Airline consultant Robert Mann said UAL still faced high fuel prices. \"The pressure is not off for sure,\" he said. \"It\\'s never off, but particularly not now.\" Analysts had expected the carrier to earn $1.43 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. But UAL noted that it had recorded income tax expenses that reduced earnings by 43 cents per share. Excluding those expenses, the quarterly results topped expectations, said Benchmark Co. analyst Helane Becker. \"Most people did not have them on a fully-taxed basis,\" she said. UAL, which emerged from bankruptcy in February, said that excluding special items, profit was $335 million, compared with $165 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to $5.18 billion from $4.66 billion. UAL said its operating expenses increased by only 8 percent, despite a 23 percent increase in fuel costs. \"Expenses were little lower than I was expecting, so it was not a bad quarter,\" Becker said. U.S. airlines have been battered by soaring fuel costs this year. Intense low-fare competition in the industry has made it hard for the companies to raise fares enough to cover costs. Carriers, however, have managed to pull capacity -- the number of seats for sale -- from their systems and raise fares accordingly. As a result, airlines are seeing profits. UAL expects to raise its mainline capacity by 1 percent in 2007, Chief Financial Officer Jake Brace said on a conference call with analysts and reporters. The company used its bankruptcy protection to slash its costs by $7 billion a year. The carrier, along with its rivals, continues to seek ways to trim labor costs and costs of operations by improving airline efficiency. \"We reported costs that were competitive with our peers,\" Chief Executive Glenn Tilton said in a recorded message to employees. \"Through our continuous improvement efforts, we are improving our work processes and identifying new cost-savings opportunities.\" United and other airlines have enjoyed a decline in energy costs in recent months. Since August, the price of crude oil CLc1 -- directly linked to the price of jet fuel -- has fallen nearly 25 percent. Nevertheless, the price remains historically high and is a burden on airlines. UAL said that as of Monday, it had hedged 34 percent of its expected fuel consumption against sharp price increases in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 25 percent in the first quarter of 2007. The company said it had ended the quarter with a cash position of $4.9 billion, including $860 million in restricted cash. Shares of UAL were down 78 cents, or 2.2 percent, at $35.99 in afternoon Nasdaq trade after falling as low as $35.50 earlier in the session.',\n",
       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Car dealership chain Group 1 Automotive Inc. ( GPI.N ) will need to cut orders of 2007-model year vehicles from Detroit\\'s Big Three automakers to reduce inventories of unsold vehicles, its chief executive said on Tuesday. \\n\\n \"We have probably at least 30 percent too much inventory, maybe 40 percent for our current level of sales,\" CEO Earl Hesterberg told Reuters in an interview. \"So in future months we have to be ordering 30 or 40 percent less vehicles than what we are actually retailing.\" Hesterberg said the inventory situation at Group 1 is \"very poor to the degree that to us it is unacceptable.\" Group 1 has more than 100 days supply of vehicles from General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co.( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler AG\\'s Chrysler Group DCXGn.DE. The CEO said the company aims to reduce the inventory levels of the Big Three brands to a 75 days supply, but production cuts from the automakers are needed to bring inventories in line. The chain on Tuesday posted a 22 percent increase in third-quarter earnings on improved margins and raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up nearly 10 percent.',\n",
       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are on track to finish October stronger than a year ago, but without enough momentum for Detroit to sell out its inventory of 2006 models, analysts said on Monday. \\n\\n Automakers are due to report October sales on Wednesday. The data will be closely watched for how the traditional Big Three U.S. car companies are managing unsold 2006 models. The persistent inventory problem is particularly pressing for Chrysler Group, the U.S. arm of DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, which ended September with 533,220 unsold vehicles, or an 82-day supply on its dealer lots, the highest tally in the industry. Chrysler\\'s dealer inventory in September was down 7 percent from a year earlier but remained higher than inventory levels for GM, which had a 76-day supply of cars, and Ford, which had 74. However, analysts said lower gas prices may have helped General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and Chrysler sell some of their pricier trucks and SUVs, which were shunned by consumers for most of this year. Overall sales are also expected to look better in comparison to October 2005, which marked a seven-year low for U.S. auto sales after a summer of showroom discounts by GM, Ford and Chrysler, analysts said. Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry forecast overall sales would come in at an annualized rate of 16.4 million units, up from 14.8 million a year earlier. Barry forecast a 26 percent year-on-year increase for GM, which he said would mark a \"modest\" increase because of the No. 1 automaker\\'s 23-percent sales decline a year earlier. He said he expected Ford to post a 14-percent sales gain, which he called \"weak\" given its 23-percent drop a year ago. Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold forecast an 18-percent sales gain for GM and a 10-percent rise for Ford. \"Inventory appears to be building for the Big Three and incentives are picking up modestly,\" he said. Executives have been cautious in their public assessments. \"We look a lot like last (September),\" GM sales analyst Paul Ballew said last week. \"We\\'re seeing a pretty strong truck mix. We are having a good month on full-size pickups.\" George Pipas, Ford\\'s sales analyst, said any bounce in truck sales in October would not change the downtrend as consumers seek more fuel-efficient cars and \"crossover\" vehicles. \"I wouldn\\'t characterize it as a return to normal,\" he said. \"You may see some strength, but I don\\'t think it\\'s sustainable until the economic fundamentals improve.\" CHRYSLER UNDER SPOTLIGHT Chrysler is forecast to end October with the weakest relative sales among the Big Three, with forecasts ranging between a 3-percent decline and a 6-percent gain. The company, which has slipped to fourth-place in the U.S. market behind a surging Toyota Motor Corp.( 7203.T ), said last week it had another 50,000 vehicles unassigned to any dealers and without an immediate destination in addition to its disclosed dealer inventory. Other U.S. automakers have moved away from such \"sales banks\" of unsold vehicles. Chrysler, which blamed its inventory problem on a $1.48 billion third-quarter operating loss, plans to sell all of the vehicles in its sales bank and reduce inventory to \"the low 500 to thousands\" by year end, spokesman Kevin McCormick said. \"We have a sales plan that we\\'re implementing right now with our dealers,\" McCormick said. Jesse Toprak, an analyst at Edmunds.com, estimated that Chrysler spent an average of $4,200 on sales incentives on its vehicles in October, flat from September. GM and Ford, by contrast, both spent less and cut back on such costly offers, he said. \"Chrysler is having to spend more than the others,\" he said.',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence slipped slightly in October, weakened by consumers\\' less favorable view of the job market, a survey showed on Tuesday. \\n\\n The Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment edged down to 105.4 in October from an upwardly revised 105.9 in September. The highest reading during the past year was in April 2006 when the index read 109.8; the lowest reading during that period was in October 2005, soon after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, when the consumer confidence index read 85.2. Economists polled by Reuters on average had forecast an October reading of 108.0. \"October\\'s dip in confidence was prompted by consumers\\' mixed assessment of present-day business conditions and a less favorable view of the job market,\" Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, said in a news release. \"Overall, October\\'s readings continue to suggest a moderate pace of economic growth and more of the same for the first few months of 2007,\" Franco said. Consumers\\' assessment of present-day conditions was less favorable in October than in September. The business research group\\'s present situation index fell to 124.7 in October from 128.3 in September. The expectations index rose to 92.6 in October from 91.0 in September. Consumers took a dimmer view of labor market conditions in October. Consumers who said jobs were \"plentiful\" declined to 25.8 percent in October from 26.2 percent in September, while those who claimed that jobs were \"hard to get\" rose to 22.0 percent in October from 20.9 percent in September.

It was the biggest increase since a 1.1 percent rise in the first quarter of 2004 and matched a 1.0 percent gain during the second quarter of that year. The larger-than-expected increase in costs likely adds some worry to Federal Reserve policy-makers as they weigh whether they are done raising interest rates to curb inflation even as the economy cools. Wages and salaries advanced 0.9 percent during the third quarter after logging a 0.9 percent gain the prior quarter. Benefit costs advanced 1.1 percent after a 0.8 percent rise, the biggest quarterly gain in a year. In the 12 months ended in September, employment costs were up 3.3 percent, with wages and salaries up 3.2 percent and benefit costs up 3.3 percent as well.\",\n",

A reading above 50 indicates expansion. During the same period, U.S. consumer confidence slipped to 105.4 from an upwardly revised 105.9 in September, according to The Conference Board. The median forecast from economists was for a reading of 108.0 for October. Taken together, the two pieces of data pointed to a slowing U.S. economy, economists said. U.S. government bond prices rose following the business activity and confidence data, having earlier slipped after the employment cost figures. U.S. stock markets pared gains, while the dollar fell. The Employment Cost Index, a broad gauge of what employers pay in wages and benefits, rose by a larger-than-expected 1.0 percent in the third quarter, marking the largest increase since the second quarter of 2004. The rise was above the second quarter of 2006\\'s 0.9 percent gain and was larger than the 0.9 percent rise economists in a Reuters poll had forecast, Labor Department data showed. Separate data painted a mixed picture for chain store sales. U.S. chain store retail sales declined slightly in the latest week, after falling in the previous week, according to a report jointly released by the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS. Sales slipped 0.2 percent in the week ended October 28, compared with a 1.1 percent decrease in the previous week. However, compared with the same week a year ago, chain store sales rose 2.3 percent. Another gauge of chain store sales, the Redbook index, showed chain store sales rising 3.3 percent for the week ended October 28 from the same time a year ago after a 3.2 percent rise the week before.

Hackett will formally issue the study next week. The study estimates that increased use of cheaper overseas labor could affect up to 1.47 million back-office jobs, or nearly 3,000 at a typical Fortune 500 company. Some of the job functions that can now more readily be shipped overseas than they could several years ago include IT, finance, human resources and procurement, the group said. \"Over the past few years, the resources available offshore have matured to an extent no one could have imagined, creating a paradigm shift that companies can ignore only at their peril,\" said Julio Ramirez, Hackett managing director. The education base and skill set, and with it the potential savings on labor costs, is on the rise in India, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Eastern Europe, Brazil and other emerging countries, the Hackett study contends.

The Interior Department had ordered Chevron to pay $6 million in additional royalties but could have sought tens of millions more if it prevailed. The decision sets a precedent that could make it easier for oil and gas companies to lower the value of what they pump each year from federal property and thus their payments to the government, the Times reported. The agency notified Chevron of its decision in a letter on August 3, which the Times obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.',\n",
       "  \" WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. drivers faced their first rise in gasoline costs in three months as the national average pump price increased a penny over the last week to $2.22 a gallon, the government said on Monday. \\n\\n The average price for regular unleaded gasoline is still close to the lowest level since last December and 26 cents less than a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration's weekly survey of service stations. After reaching a summer high of $3.04 a gallon on August 7, the pump price had declined 83 cents, dropping for a record 11 weeks in a row. The rise in the latest gasoline price mirrors last week's increase in crude oil costs, after a government report showed an unexpected, large drop in U.S. oil and petroleum product inventories and market concerns emerged about a possible al Qaeda attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities. The price of crude oil accounts for about half the cost of making gasoline. The new jump at the pump could be short-lived as oil settled down $2.39, or nearly 4 percent, to $58.36 a barrel in Monday trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange after traders became less worried about a threat of terror attacks on Saudi oil sites. In the EIA's new weekly survey, West Coast service stations had the most expensive gasoline by region, down 4.5 cents to $2.41 a gallon. Los Angeles had the highest pump price among cities at $2.42 a gallon, down 4.6 cents. The cheapest gasoline was again along the Gulf Coast at $2.10 a gallon, up 1.1 cents. Houston had the best deal at the pump at $2.02, up 1.3 cents. The EIA also reported that prices were down 4.2 cents in San Francisco at $2.41, down 6.8 cents in Seattle at $2.39, down 1.7 cents in Miami at $2.31, up 4.1 cents in Chicago at $2.27, up 0.4 cent in New York City at $2.18, down 3.5 cents in Denver at $2.15 and up 0.2 cent in Boston at $2.15. Separately, the EIA said the price truckers paid for diesel fuel fell a slight 0.7 cent to $2.52 a gallon, down 36 cents from a year ago.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc., trying to distance itself from accusations it overcharges customers, on Tuesday said it will disclose more about tax-refund loans, and warn clients who have debt that might affect the loan process. \\n\\n The changes concern refund-anticipation loans, which are short-term cash advances by the tax-return preparer to clients who expect refunds. In September, H&R Block said it will slash fees on typical refund loans by more than 40 percent. Kansas City, Missouri-based H&R Block offers the loans through a partnership with a U.S. unit of Britain\\'s HSBC Holdings Plc. Under the new process, borrowers will receive a chart showing filing options, fees and the time it takes to obtain refunds. H&R Block will also notify prospective borrowers if they have outstanding fees from tax preparation or prior refund loans that might affect lending decisions. Mark Ernst, H&R Block\\'s chief executive, in a statement said the changes are intended to make H&R Block\\'s disclosure policies industry-leading. Spokeswoman Linda McDougall said the changes were \"not inspired by litigation.\" A copy of the new disclosures was not immediately available. Refund loans are typically extended for less than two weeks, and many go to poor customers. Their fees result in high effective annualized interest rates that can reach three digits. On August 28, U.S. District Judge Elaine Bucklo in Chicago approved a $39 million settlement to end an eight-year-old class-action lawsuit against H&R Block over the loans. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer in February accused H&R Block in a separate lawsuit of overcharging borrowers. Under its new fee schedule, H&R Block said a typical $2,800 refund loan might cost as little as $60, equating to a 36 percent annual interest rate, if customers open H&R Block bank accounts and arrange for refunds to be deposited directly into them. The company has said it hopes to open 1 million bank accounts by April. H&R Block also faces a lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer over what he calls excessive fees on its Express IRA retirement accounts. Defaults have risen at a mortgage unit, and H&R Block has lost market share to Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc.

MetLife said operating earnings, which analysts use to measure performance because it excludes investment gains and losses, were $958 million or $1.24 a share. Analysts on average had expected the life insurer to earn $1.17 a share, according to Reuters estimates. \"It was a huge quarter for MetLife,\" said Will Retzer of SNL Financial, who does not rate the stock. \"They beat all the earnings estimates and set the tone for the rest of the year. In the year-ago quarter, MetLife earned $780 million or $1.01 a share in operating earnings. However, on a sequential basis, MetLife\\'s earnings were not as impressive, said Douglas Meyer, an analyst with Fitch Ratings. He noted that second-quarter operating net was $982 million or $1.28 a share. One sour note was MetLife\\'s institutional business, where operating earnings remained relatively flat with year ago levels due to lower interest rate spreads in the retirement and savings business. \"That was worrisome because institutional business is typically one of their biggest drivers,\" said Celent analyst Donald Light, who noted that the latest figure of $390 million was off by $63 million from the second quarter. Light said he has a small position in MetLife. The insurer, ranked as the biggest by rating firm A.M. Best, said in June that it expected to earn $4.55 to $4.75 a share for the year with the help of its 2005 acquisition of Travelers Life & Annuity from Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) in 2005. Since the start of the year, MetLife shares rose nearly 21 percent compared to a 4.3 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\\'s insurance .GSPINSC. It trades at a price to earnings multiple of 12 compared to 14.7 for a group of comparable insurers. After the close. the shares drifted higher in after-hours trading. MetLife also benefited from the sale of its 80-acres (32 hectares) of New York apartments on Manhattan\\'s East Side earlier this month to a real estate venture and a private equity firm for $5.4 billion, nearly $500 million higher than most expected. The sale of the 11,000 apartments will result in a gain to MetLife of about $3 billion before the year ends, and analysts have predicted the company could use at least part of that for a share buyback or increase in the dividend. \"With all this new capital, I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see more merger and acquisition activity,\" said Retzer. MetLife said it intended to resume its share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and currently has $716 million remaining on its existing authorization. MetLife said that it had record total premiums, fees and other revenue of $8.1 billion in the third quarter and reached $516.2 billion in total assets. Auto and home operating earnings were $107 million compared to a loss in the year ago quarter when hurricanes hit, while total life earnings and earnings from annuities both increased 11 percent.',\n",

Earlier in October, IBM relocated its global procurement headquarters to Shenzhen in southern China.

IBM is focusing on services-oriented architecture (SOA), which makes it easier for businesses to quickly find information stored in different formats. The company sees SOA as a key driver of future growth, and hopes the technology will help sell other products, such as server computers and consulting services. The new center at Pune will focus on developing solutions for the insurance and healthcare industries, while the Beijing facility will tap the growing technology services demand from banks and government departments.

       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan\\'s Toshiba Corp. doubled its first-half net profit and raised its full-year profit forecast by 22 percent, driven by gains in the power segment, but problems in the very same segment caused bigger rival Hitachi Ltd. to post a larger loss. \\n\\n Toshiba, Japan\\'s second-largest electronics conglomerate, raised its annual profit forecast to 110 billion yen ($936.9 million), above a consensus estimate of 95.6 billion yen from 18 analysts polled by Reuters, boosted by sales of its electric power systems and planned sales of assets, including its stake in chip wafer maker Toshiba Ceramics Co. Ltd. Japan\\'s big industrial electronics makers have been struggling for years to trim down their many businesses, to better compete with global competition. Toshiba, in particular, is focusing on the energy business, having earlier this month taken a 77 percent stake in Westinghouse, the U.S. power plant unit of British Nuclear Fuels, for $4.16 billion. But Hitachi, Japan\\'s biggest electronics conglomerate with more than 300,000 employees, has fallen behind in deciding what units and subsidiaries to let go, said analysts and an investor. \"I think the earnings confirmed relative firmness in Toshiba versus its rivals,\" such as Hitachi or NEC Corp., said Shozui Kobayashi, assistant fund manager at United Investments Co. Toshiba, the world\\'s No. 2 maker of NAND flash memory after South Korea\\'s Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., earned a first-half net profit of 38.83 billion yen, with profits in its chip business growing 15.4 percent from the previous year. Gains from power systems outweighed lower-than-expected chip profit, hit by NAND flash memory prices falls of 50 percent in the six months to the end of September, Toshiba Corporate Executive Vice President Fumio Muraoka said. \"The Christmas shopping season is coming up, and we expect NAND price falls to slow down in the second half,\" he said of NAND flash memory, used in digital music players like Apple Computer Inc.\\'s iPod. \"In the meantime, we will accelerate globalisation of the power systems business.\" In contrast, at Hitachi, which makes everything from vacuum cleaners to nuclear energy plants, price falls were exacerbated by additional losses in the power business. Hitachi posted a loss that was seven times bigger than the previous year, and projected a net loss of 55 billion yen for the year to March on bigger-than-expected drops in hard disk drive prices, cost overruns at its U.S. coal-fired thermal power plant and repairs of Hitachi-designed turbines that caused shut downs at nuclear power generators at two Japanese utilities. The utility firms said last week they might seek compensation from Hitachi for lost revenues and increased costs due to the shut downs. Hitachi\\'s hard disk drive segment would remain in the red this year, and would not regain profitability until next business year, Hitachi Executive Vice President Takashi Miyoshi said. Hitachi posted a net loss of 78.1 billion yen, in line with analyst estimates after the company cut its first-half and annual forecasts last month. Toshiba shares rose 12 percent, while Hitachi shares tumbled 17 percent in the April to September period. The Tokyo market\\'s electrical machinery index fell 4.38 percent.',\n",
       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Private equity firms Carlyle Group and Unison Capital led a $774 million management buyout of chip wafer maker Toshiba Ceramics Co., making it Japan\\'s second largest buyout this year. \\n\\n Parent Toshiba Corp., Japan\\'s No. 2 electronics conglomerate after Hitachi Ltd., plans to sell its 40.4 percent stake in the wafer maker to focus its resources on flash memory chips used in mobile phones and music players and its nuclear power business. Carlyle and Unison will jointly set up a special-purpose vehicle to buy all Toshiba Ceramics shares at 600 yen each through a tender offer from November 1 to December 4, an 8.5 percent premium to the last closing price and valuing the deal at about 91 billion yen ($774 million). Investment bank Nomura will act as the agent for the tender offer while UBS advised Toshiba Ceramics. Shares of Toshiba Ceramics closed 7.8 percent higher at 596 yen. The tender offer price values Toshiba Ceramics at 24 times its earnings forecast for this business year. That compares with 22 times at rival Shin-Etsu Chemical Co and 15 times at SUMCO Corp. Management buyouts have been relatively rare in Japan, where rigid shareholding structures have discouraged them, although a growing number of the country\\'s sprawling conglomerates are choosing to dispose of non-core units this way in an effort to streamline their businesses. The deal is the second-biggest MBO this year, behind the $3.2 billion buyout of restaurant operator Skylark Co., and is the fourth biggest on record in Japan, according to financial data providers Dealogic. More companies find leaving mammoth organisational structures speeds up decision-making, said Carlyle Group Managing Director Tamotsu Adachi. \"By leaving these big organisations, businesses are freed to seek new clients among the parent firm\\'s rivals, find new sources of funding and grow,\" he told reporters after a news conference. After the buyout, Toshiba Ceramics would have access to credit lines of 140 billion yen, including those from the funds and banks, up 83 percent from capital raised this year, Toshiba Ceramics President Susumu Kohyama said. A WIN-WIN DEAL? During the first half of 2006, the value of MBOs in Japan hit a record $3.1 billion, according to data provider Thomson Financial. In an MBO, management acquire a controlling stake in the company, often in partnership with a private equity house which can provide capital and financial expertise. Three senior managers at Toshiba Ceramics each have only a 0.01 percent equity shareholding in the company, but they may raise this if the tender offer is successful. Toshiba Ceramics, which had group sales of about 85 billion yen in the business year ended in March and is dwarfed in the silicon wafer market by larger rivals Shin-Etsu and SUMCO, plans to spend roughly 30 billion yen to boost production capacity of cost-efficient 300 millimeter silicon wafers to 150,000 wafers per month by 2009. Toshiba may regret letting Toshiba Ceramics go at a time when strong chip demand is boosting sales of wafers, said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. \"This is an area where Japan has competitive strength and I thought it (Toshiba Ceramics) would become an attractive company with some support. I am a little disappointed,\" Akino said. Washington-based Carlyle raised 216 billion yen in July, the largest ever for a Japan-dedicated buyout fund. Its portfolio of companies in Japan has included mobile services firm Willcom Inc. and crane maker Kito Corp. Japan-based buyout fund Unison has invested in such Japanese companies as Kanebo Ltd. and the $1.5 billion management buyout of condominium maker Recruit Cosmos Co., Ltd last year. Private equity has been involved in $23.7 billion worth of acquisitions in Japan so far this year, or 114 transactions, more than three times the level during the same period last year of $7.23 billion in 63 deals, Dealogic said.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eastman Kodak Co.EK.N, the world\\'s top maker of photographic film, on Tuesday posted its eighth consecutive quarterly loss, but cost cuts helped results top Wall Street expectations and the company\\'s shares rose 5 percent. \\n\\n Kodak, which is undergoing a lengthy and expensive transformation into a maker of digital cameras and printing products and services, said its 2006 loss will be smaller than previously forecast, adding that its shift remains \"on track.\" The company, however, warned that digital revenue growth in the year would fall short of its 10-percent goal as it focuses on selling products that generate higher profits. Since late 2003, Kodak has focused on digital devices, hoping to outpace the drop in demand for film, historically its main revenue source. At the same time, it is reducing costs by cutting up to 27,000 jobs and trimming manufacturing. \"The consumer digital group (has begun) to realize the benefit of trading unprofitable revenue growth for margin expansion, especially in the area of digital cameras and in printer docks,\" said Kodak Chief Executive Antonio Perez, on a conference call. Rochester, New York-based Kodak posted a net loss of $37 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with a loss of $914 million, or $3.18 a share, a year earlier, when it took a $778 million tax-related charge. Excluding restructuring costs and other special items, the company had a profit of was 44 cents per share, handily exceeding analysts\\' average expectation of 19 cents. Third-quarter revenue slipped to $3.2 billion from $3.55 billion, falling short of the analysts\\' view of $3.28 billion. Digital revenue fell 1.2 percent, and traditional film sales declined by 19 percent. RESULTS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE Wall Street analysts have found it difficult to measure Kodak\\'s overall health due to the constant restructuring over the past three years. While some units have grown and added workers, others are cutting operations and jobs. \"As long as they continue to do (so many) charges, you are not going to see a lot of upside from this stock,\" said Tom Carroll, vice president of research for Bullfinch Funds, who says he no longer owns Kodak shares. Overall, analysts characterized the quarter as mixed. \"They are decreasing costs faster than revenues are declining, but top line is not growing as fast as the Street had hoped,\" said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. \"The concern is that digital revenue is decelerating pretty dramatically.\" Kodak said it now expects 2006 total revenue to be down 6 percent, with a loss from continuing operations of $400 million to $600 million. In August, Kodak forecast a loss of $500 million to $850 million from continuing operations, with full-year revenue declining 3 percent. The company deflected analysts\\' questions on the call about the future of its health unit and long-standing plans to introduce inkjet printers, saying that news in those areas would be announced before the end of the year. One year ago, Kodak posted a large noncash charge to write down of the value of deferred tax assets as a result of current and expected U.S. losses from its extensive restructuring launched in January 2004. Kodak shares were up 93 cents at $24.68 in afternoon morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.',\n",

SideStep plans to combine TravelPost's reviews with its own site in the coming months, matching travelers with hotels based on advice from people with similar interests. SideStep, ranked No. 10 among U.S. travel sites, according to Web audience measurement firm Hitwise Inc., is competing with Internet media giant Yahoo Inc., which this year introduced an upgraded version of Yahoo Travel that combines fare search, mapping and user reviews on one site. Yahoo ranks No. 5 among U.S. travel sites, behind Expedia, Travelocity, Cheap Tickets and Orbitz. SideStep, founded in 1999 and based in the Silicon Valley hub of Santa Clara, California, counts 5 million monthly users. It offers the sort of Web search technology offered by Google or Yahoo but zeros in on 150 different travel sites to improve the relevancy of business travel or tourism-related searches. San Mateo, California-based TravelPost.com, founded in early 2004 and made up entirely of user-generated reviews, has about 700,000 monthly visitors, a SideStep spokeswoman said. About 250,000 users have contributed reviews on some 50,000 hotels or resorts. The reviews are designed to be integrated with existing blogs. SideStep is privately held and has raised more than $17 million in funding from Trident Capital and individual investors. Earlier this year, Rob Solomon, former general manager of Yahoo Shopping, took over as president and chief executive of SideStep.\",\n",

( CMI.N ), a diesel engine maker, said on Tuesday third-quarter earnings rose 18 percent, as the effort to rebuild Iraq\\'s infrastructure, which was shattered by the war and insurgency, powered strong sales of its power generation and distribution products. \\n\\n Sales at its key diesel engine unit rose 10 percent during the quarter, reflecting the rush by North American truckers to update their fleets ahead of tough, new U.S. emissions rules next year that will require more expensive engines. The Columbus, Indiana-based company said third-quarter profit jumped to $171 million, or $3.37 a share, from $145 million, or $2.90 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 14 percent to $2.81 billion, despite steep production cuts by some of the Detroit automakers it supplies. Analysts, on average, expected net profit of $3.68 a share and a profit from continuing operations of $3.65 a share on sales of $2.74 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Looking forward, the company sees earnings between $14 and $14.20 a share for the full year. Analysts, on average, expected $14.33 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Cummins said the standout segments were power generation, where sales rose 24 percent, and power distribution, up 17 percent. Cummins said more than one-half of those gains came as a result of the \"reconstruction efforts in the Middle East.\"',\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) posted a better-than-expected 33 percent jump in quarterly profit on Tuesday as the addition of products such as Gillette razors led to strong sales and the company slightly raised its full-year view due to easing commodity and energy costs. \\n\\n But the high end of P&G\\'s profit view for the current quarter just meets the average forecast already expected by Wall Street and P&G shares slipped as much as 2 percent before staging a bit of a rebound. \"We\\'re more concerned with what the long term prospects of the company are and I think those are still very favorable,\" said Eric Schoenstein, co-manager of the Jensen Portfolio, which held 1.75 million P&G shares as of September. \"I didn\\'t hear anything this morning that made me change my thoughts about where they were headed.\" P&G, whose products range from Pampers diapers to Iams dog food, said it sees costs improving after facing higher prices for oil-based materials and transportation in recent quarters. \"This is the first company I\\'ve seen to publicly say that commodity costs will benefit them over the next few quarters and, hopefully, that will be the first shot across the bow for all companies in the ... sector,\" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Bill Chappell, who has a \"buy\" rating on the shares. The cost of raw materials and energy should still be up this year, but the amount of the increases should be lower in the past two years, Chief Financial Officer Clayt Daley said during a conference call. Profit rose to $2.7 billion, or 79 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, from $2.03 billion, or 77 cents, a year earlier. The results topped analysts\\' average view by a penny per share and came in ahead of P&G\\'s own forecast of 76 cents to 78 cents per share. Sales soared 27 percent to $18.79 billion, beating Wall Street\\'s $18.61 billion forecast, driven by new items such as redesigned Herbal Essences hair care products and the addition of Gillette razors, batteries and toothbrushes. \"These results will not create skeptics, but we do not think they will create many new believers in PG shares at this valuation,\" wrote Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, who has a \"peer perform\" rating on P&G, in a research note. P&G shares have risen 3 percent since the company\\'s fiscal year started on October 1, in line with the Dow Jones Industrial average  .DJI , of which it is a component. The shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18.6 times. Competitor Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ) trades at 19.6 times, while Unilever Plc ( ULVR.L ) trades at 14.7 times. COMMODITIES EASE; GILLETTE ON TRACK Cincinnati-based P&G bought Gillette in October 2005, so the year-ago period did not include any results from Gillette. Sales excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, rose 6 percent, after being up 8 percent in the fourth quarter. Commodity costs hit gross margin by about 1 percentage point, but that pressure was offset in part by price increases and the addition of Gillette. Gross margin rose 1.2 percentage points to 52.8 percent of sales. Daley said P&G forecasts oil will cost $60 to $65 per barrel this year and expects some relief from suppliers\\' higher prices in the second half of the fiscal year. The company has already announced a price increase on Duracell batteries due to high zinc prices, but will not see the benefit until the second half of the year, he said. P&G said operating margins should improve by 0.5 to 1 percentage point in the current quarter and by more than 1 percentage point this year, driven by improved gross margins. The company now expects to earn $2.97 to $3.02 per share this year, including a hit of 12 cents to 18 cents per share from Gillette. It previously expected to earn $2.96 to $3.00 per share with the same impact from Gillette. Analysts had been calling for a profit of $3.00 for the fiscal year, which ends in June. P&G still expects full year sales excluding mergers and the impact of foreign exchange to rise by 4 percent to 6 percent and total sales growth of 9 percent to 11 percent. For the current quarter, P&G forecast earnings of 81 cents to 83 cents per share, while analysts had expected a profit of 83 cents per share. P&G forecast organic sales growth of 4 percent to 7 percent in the quarter. Daley said the integration of Gillette is still on track and the company expects to complete most of the job cuts related to the deal by year end. The shares, which set a new high of $64.02 on Monday, were down 59 cents at $63.22 on Tuesday afternoon after falling to $62.50.',\n",

But on Monday, thousands of Viacom clips of varying lengths of up to about 10 minutes each remained available on the top video-sharing service. The source said Viacom, owner of the Comedy Central cable network, had sent a letter last Friday requesting that some of its shows -- including the popular \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\", \"The Colbert Report\" and those from MTV Networks and BET -- be purged from the site. Viacom and YouTube declined to comment on the matter. YouTube user Jeff Reifman, founder of Web site NewsCloud and a former Microsoft Corp. employee, said YouTube informed him in two letters of the removal of Comedy Central clips he had uploaded. YouTube received \"a third-party notification by Comedy Central\" of copyright infringement, according to the letters, he said. Viacom\\'s demand comes after Google Inc. agreed this month to buy YouTube for $1.65 billion, which analysts said would intensify a push by media companies to seek a way to seek reimbursement for pirated clips or seek legal recourse. Most top music companies and several U.S. TV networks including NBC Universal and CBS Corp. have inked advertising deals with YouTube. News Corp.\\'s social network site, MySpace, said on Monday it had licensed a new technology from Gracenote to block the uploading of copyrighted music files. Unlike MySpace, YouTube\\'s policy is to leave it up to users to determine what to upload, but it will take down videos at the program owner\\'s request. Its user agreement asks users to seek permission from copyright owners before uploading clips. YouTube, which carries tens of millions of clips, also restricts regular user accounts from uploading more than 100 megabytes of video or clips longer than 10 minutes. Professional producers, musicians and \"amateur filmmakers\" who register with YouTube are permitted to upload longer video clips, according to its Web site. Internet observers including Reifman noted the irony of pulling down clips from Stewart and Colbert. Bloggers note that Colbert joked that he deserved $700 million of the $1.65 billion in stock Google plans to pay for YouTube. The video clip of that particular Colbert episode had been removed by the user, according to YouTube\\'s site.',\n",

The legal actions include 15 in the United States, 10 in Germany, 10 in the Netherlands, five in France and five in Britain, as well as proceedings in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Korea, Mexico and Poland. The cases are against sellers who the company says have misused their eBay or other online auction site accounts to sell counterfeit software. Microsoft said it had sent warnings for infringing behavior to many of the defendants before taking the legal action. \"Counterfeit software is defective and dangerous because counterfeiters tamper with the genuine software code, which leaves the door open to identity theft and other serious security breaches,\" Matt Lundy, a senior attorney at Microsoft, said in a statement. Microsoft analyzed counterfeit Windows XP programs in June this year and said it found that 34 percent of the disks could not be installed on a computer, and another 43 percent contained additional programs, or binary code, that are not part of the operating system.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Regional telephone company Qwest Communications International Inc. ( Q.N ) on Tuesday reported a third-quarter profit from a year-ago loss as it cut costs, but shares fell 3 percent on a disappointing cash flow forecast. \\n\\n Analysts also voiced concern over competition the company faces from cable providers offering all-in-one packages of video, voice, and Internet after the data showed a fall in access lines. \"I think they\\'re starting to show competition from Comcast ( CMCSA.O ) and Cox,\" said Janco Partners analyst Donna Jaegers of the two cable operators. While lower spending helped improve Qwest\\'s balance sheet, it may also be hindering its battle against cable companies that are aggressively marketing high-speed Internet and voice services, Jaegers said. Qwest, which provides local service in 14 states in the western United States, reported profit of $194 million, or 9 cents per share, compared with a loss of $144 million, or 8 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings of 7 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating revenue fell to $3.49 billion from $3.50 billion in 2005, when it recognized $52 million from a large government contract. The figure was in line with analysts\\' estimates. The company, which has struggled over the past few years to reduce massive debt, said net debt dropped to $13.7 billion at the end of the quarter, down $800 million from end-2005. Operating expenses fell 6.3 percent to $3.1 billion with improved productivity, operating efficiencies and lower facilities costs. The expenses also included $43 million in severance charges. Qwest, like bigger peers AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ), has been helped by a rise in Internet subscriptions as traditional phone subscriptions declined. The company added over 175,000 high-speed Internet lines in the third quarter, a rise of 47 percent from last year and 10 percent sequentially. But some analysts also noted a 6 percent fall in Qwest\\'s total access lines as evidence of increased competition from the cable industry. FREE CASH FLOW DISAPPOINTS Helped by lower debt and spending, Qwest generated free cash flow of $358 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $803 million -- nearly 70 percent higher than a year earlier. But analysts said such improvements had mostly been priced into the shares, which have surged 60 percent since the start of the year, and that they had hoped the company would upgrade its free cash flow forecast.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bra and underwear maker Hanesbrands Inc. ( HBI.N ) on Tuesday said net income sank on rising interest expenses, sliding operating profit and higher income taxes during its first quarter as a publicly traded company. \\n\\n The maker of Playtex, Wonderbra and Hanes undergarments, which food company Sara Lee Corp. SLE.N spun off in early September, said net income had fallen to $50.3 million, or 52 cents per share, from $82.6 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. For the quarter ended September 30, sales dropped 1.7 percent to $1.12 billion as the company exited from low-margin product lines and suffered from declining sales of sheer hosiery. The company is only followed by one analyst, according to Reuters Research, so no accurate Wall Street comparisons are possible. Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Hanesbrands, which also makes Champion brand T-shirts and active wear, has been closing U.S. manufacturing plants and cutting jobs to make its operations more efficient. On October 26, the company announced a purchase of a sewing operation in Thailand as a low-cost supply chain. OUTLOOK The company did not give specific guidance for its next fiscal year, which will stretch from December 31, 2006 to December 29, 2007. Instead, it said the \"current annual sales run rate of approximately $4.5 billion reflects a good baseline from which to build.\" The company warned it will incur higher costs as a stand-alone company and said it plans to increase investment behind its strategies. Still, it will offset expenses with cost reductions and benefit from cutting corporate allocations related to its previous Sara Lee ownership. Under these conditions, it expects its operating profit margin in the next fiscal year, excluding restructuring, to approach 9-1/2 percent, similar to the operating margin in its most recently completed fiscal year ended July 1, 2006. Overall growth goals include long-term annual revenue growth of 1 percent to 3 percent, excluding acquisitions and long-term annual operating profit growth of 6 percent to 8 percent, excluding the effect of restructuring charges. The company also expects long-term annual double-digit growth in earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges. Shares of Hanesbrands closed at $24.25 on Monday. The stock is up 23 percent since its spin off on September 5 and is selling for 11.3 times next year\\'s expected earnings, compared with 15.6 times competitor Kellwood Co. KWD.N.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Philip Morris attorney on Tuesday challenged a $79.5 million punitive damages award to a former smoker\\'s widow, arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court the tobacco giant could not be punished for harm to other smokers. \\n\\n But a lawyer for Mayola Williams, whose husband died of lung cancer in 1997 after smoking for more than 40 years, defended the large award won by his client. \"This jury did a very good job,\" he said in urging that the award be upheld. The case has been closely watched by business groups who want the nation\\'s high court to impose new constitutional limits on punitive damages designed to punish and deter misconduct. Businesses have long complained that punitive damages are skyrocketing out of control, can be arbitrary and encourage frivolous lawsuits. Lawyers for those who have been injured defend big awards as a way to get companies to fix harmful product defects. The justices during the hour-long arguments showed little interest in tightening the constitutional limits on punitive damages. They instead focused mostly on a procedural questions and the instructions given to the jury. They repeatedly asked whether the jury had been properly told and understood the distinction that it could consider the harm to other smokers in assessing the misconduct by the Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) unit, but could not punish the company for the harm to others who were not parties in the lawsuit. The justices also questioned whether the jury instructions proposed by Philip Morris were an improvement over the actual instructions. And they said they did not understand the basis for the Oregon Supreme Court ruling upholding the award. \"Isn\\'t perhaps the better course to send this back to them (the Oregon Supreme Court) and say, \\'We don\\'t know what you mean,\\'\" Justice David Souter said. At least two other justices suggested such a resolution of the case. Andrew Frey, the attorney for Philip Morris, challenged the award as excessive and unfair punishment. \"The problem we were worried about was that the jury would think of itself as the punishment agency to impose statewide punishment for the harms to all Oregon smokers who were deceived by Philip Morris,\" he said. But Robert Peck, representing the smoker\\'s wife, defended the award she won in her lawsuit for fraud and negligence. \"This was a massive, market-directed fraud driven by their rational and deliberate decisions at the highest levels of the company to deceive customers and knowingly endanger their health,\" he said. \"They knew that this would have a special impact on those who are highly addicted, as Jesse Williams was. And so this is the misconduct that Oregon is seeking to deter,\" Peck said. In response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts, Peck said he is not asking the court to overturn any of its past precedents on punitive damages. The court last ruled on the issue in 2003. The court is expected to rule in the case before the middle of next year.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Electric Power Co. Inc. ( AEP.N ), one of the largest U.S. utilities, on Tuesday posted lower third-quarter earnings, hurt by a charge from the sale of a power plant. \\n\\n The company, which generates and distributes electricity in 11 states, said net income fell to $265 million, or 67 cents per share, from $376 million, or 99 cents per share a year earlier. The company said third-quarter earnings included a $136 million charge from the sale of its Plaquemine Cogeneration plant in Louisiana to Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ). The profit also included some gains from the sales of other assets. Excluding these items, the company said it earned 99 cents a share in the quarter, in line with the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. AEP shares were up 25 cents at $41.31 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. AEP had been helped by a rate increase at its Ohio utility and would likely see other utility rate hikes to reflect spending on environmental upgrades, said Daniele Seitz, analyst at Dahlman Rose. \"The company should be able to grow its earnings at a faster pace than before,\" said Seitz. Solid results from its MEMCO barge unit, which transports bulk commodities such as coal and grain, helped boost operating income 6 percent from the year-earlier period. \"MEMCO is having an outstanding year,\" Chief Executive Michael Morris said in a prepared statement. \"The higher rates included in 2006 contracts were driven by strong demand for barge capacity and a tight supply of barges.\" The company\\'s utility unit benefited from rate increases in Ohio and higher wholesale margins. But those factors were offset by milder weather, higher operating expenses and reduced federal transmission rates. Columbus, Ohio-based AEP still expects to earn between $2.65 to $2.80 per share for 2006. Since the beginning of the year, AEP shares have gained about 11 percent, lagging the Standard and Poor\\'s utility index .GSPU gain of some 14 percent. The utility index is trading near multiyear highs, after declining late last year as a result of interest rate and inflation concerns. The U.S. Federal Reserve\\'s decision to pause its cycle of interest rate increases has fueled the sector to continue its rebound from the power industry\\'s severe downturn in 2002.',\n",

The earnings beat Wall Street estimates, boosting the\\ncompany\\'s shares by 2.4 percent, but some analysts questioned\\nwhether this quarter\\'s turnaround was big enough to satisfy\\ncritics of Chief Executive Michael Cherkasky and ward off\\npotential takeover predators.  Marsh\\'s earnings jumped to $176 million, or 31 cents a\\nshare, from $69 million, or 12 cents a share, in the\\nyear-earlier quarter.  Cherkasky has been struggling to restructure the company\\nafter its 2005 settlement of charges that it had rigged bids\\nand steered business to insurers that paid hidden commissions.  \"There are signs of a turnaround in Marsh\\'s brokerage\\nbusiness, which suffered from the loss of those commissions,\"\\nsaid Donald Light, an analyst with Celent, noting that\\noperating income rose to $143 million from $20 million.  Excluding one-time items, Marsh & McLennan earned 38 cents\\na share, beating analysts\\' average estimate of 36 cents,\\naccording to Reuters estimates.  \"It was a decent quarter, but they have yet to see a\\nsignificant recovery,\" said Rob Haines, an analyst with\\nCreditSights. \"They\\'ve got to get kick-started now, because\\ninvestors are fed up.\"  Since the start of the year, Marsh shares have fallen 5\\npercent compared with a gain of 4 percent in the Standard &\\nPoor\\'s insurance index .GSPINSC.  Its shares hit a year low of $24.20 in August but have\\nsince risen on reports that private equity firms, possibly\\nbacked by rival Willis Group Holdings Ltd.

Reports that Jules Kroll, whose risk consulting unit is\\npart of Marsh, wanted to buy it back, were denied by Kroll.  \"The saga of Marsh has turned into a veritable soap opera,\"\\nsaid Kathy Shanley of Gimme Credit, saying pressure is on\\nCherkasky to make his case at the company\\'s conference call\\nthis morning.  Celent\\'s Light noted that Marsh still had problems in other\\nareas. Operating net from the consulting unit was slightly\\ndown, and its Putnam investment unit, which is up for sale, is\\n\"still struggling,\" he said.

       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales bounced back in October from depressed year-earlier levels as U.S. and Japanese rivals took market share away from DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, which is struggling to unload costly inventory. \\n\\n General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) posted a 22 percent gain in October sales, while Ford Motor Co.\\'s ( F.N ) sales were up 13 percent after adjusting for the additional selling day a year earlier. Both results were largely in line with expectations, but were stronger than the roughly 6 percent rise in industry-wide sales, halting for now a slide in share by the top two U.S. automakers. They were helped by better light truck sales, which also helped Japanese automakers\\' results. Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) recorded an almost 14 percent sales rise. Sales for Honda Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) were up almost 4 percent, while Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) gained 8 percent. DaimlerChrysler\\'s Chrysler Group trailed its U.S. counterparts badly with a sales gain of less than 1 percent in October, despite offering the industry-leading cash rebates and concessional financing. Chrysler said it would extend zero-percent financing for up to 60 months on 2006 models in November, continuing incentive offers that chipped away at inventories last month. Global Insight analyst George Magliano called the Chrysler sales result \"disappointing,\" saying, \"Chrysler has been spending a lot on incentives ... (and) we didn\\'t see much in the way of sales.\" Lower gasoline prices drove a rebound in sales of some trucks and SUVs -- pricey vehicles that were shunned by American car buyers earlier this year and which remain a mainstay of revenue for Detroit. \"Toyota is basically continuing the momentum of their growth,\" said Edmunds.com sales analyst Jesse Toprak, who said the Japanese automaker was on track to become the No. 2 U.S. automaker by the middle of 2007. Sales results for all the automakers benefited from comparison with October last year, which marked a seven-year low for U.S. vehicle sales after a summer of blowout discounts. INVENTORIES, CHRYSLER IN FOCUS The traditional Big Three -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- have been under pressure to manage inventories from their dealers, who have slowed orders on new models in some cases because of the higher cost of financing unsold vehicles. The problem of unsold 2006 models has been particularly pressing for Chrysler, which ended September with the highest inventory in the industry relative to its sales. Chrysler also said last month it was keeping a previously undisclosed \"sales bank\" of some 50,000 unassigned cars not counted in its inventory numbers. The company declined to comment on how many vehicles were in that sales bank as of end October, but said its goal was to eliminate it by year-end. \"We have got a very good plan with our dealers to get there,\" Steven Landry, Chrysler\\'s vice president for sales said, adding the company\\'s auditors had reviewed its treatment of unassigned inventory and were \"OK with it.\" Chrysler\\'s inventory of dealer stock declined slightly in October, falling to almost 509,000 units from 533,000 a month earlier, or 80 days of sales compared with 82 days in September. Unsold trucks represented 82 percent of that dealer inventory. Ford said discounts on its 2006 models, combined with its own steep production cuts, drove down its inventory in October, particularly for trucks and for SUVs such as the Explorer and Expedition. Inventory for Ford\\'s mass-market brands -- Ford, Lincoln and Mercury -- dropped by 30,000 units in October from September to reach 622,000 units. Of that total, 69 percent were trucks and 76 percent were 2007 models, the company said. \"Obviously, it\\'s been painful these last few months -- in the second quarter and third quarter -- to see such a reduction in SUV sales. But I do think we have our inventories more aligned with demand and that\\'s a positive thing as we head into 2007,\" said Ford sales analyst George Pipas. GM, which remains the No. 1 automaker by volume, said its own inventory was near 1 million units, including about 125,000 large SUVs and 250,000 pickup trucks. GM sales analyst Paul Ballew said unsold stock was too high for the large SUV category and said production would be cut accordingly. The segment has been a strength for GM this year, based on the launch of new models such as the Yukon. Ballew, like other industry executives, said the climate had improved for sales of trucks and SUVs, which represent about 65 percent of sales volume for the Detroit car makers. \"The real pressure point we saw in April, May has eased,\" he said. \"We have at least taken the real intense pressure off on those categories that we saw when the gas price was around $3 a gallon.\"',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Drugstore chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) on Wednesday agreed to acquire pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N for nearly $21 billion to expand its prescription benefits and mail-order business. \\n\\n CVS will exchange 1.67 of its shares for each share of Caremark, whose stock-option practices are under federal scrutiny. CVS\\' stock fell 7.5 percent on the news, putting the value of the deal at around $20.7 billion, or $48.48 a share. The offer represents no premium to shareholders of Caremark, which traded above $49 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday and as high as $59.25 in September. The deal comes at a time when the traditional pharmacy model is under pressure from intense competition, including from mail-order operations, and new issues, such as the influx of prescriptions under Medicare Part D. Mail-order drugs have eroded the business of retail pharmacies, siphoning off customers who buy medicines and also shop for other items. CVS has been signaling they were looking to make a deal involving a PBM for the past 12 months, said Frank Sustersic, a senior portfolio manager with Turner Investment Partners. \"I\\'m not surprised that CVS is an acquirer. I\\'m a little bit surprised at the transaction price,\" Sustersic said, referring to the lack of a premium. CVS closed at $29.03, down $2.35, or 7.5 percent. Caremark shares closed down 2.15 percent at $48.17. The news also dragged down the shares of rivals in both industries, including pharmacy benefits company Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS.N, which shed 5.3 percent to $50.67, and drugstores such as market leader Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ), which fell 3.6 percent to $42.11. \"When was the last time you saw a deal that hurt everyone involved? It\\'s dragging down both companies and stocks in both sectors. How could shareholders on either side of this deal OK it?\" said one trader who declined to be named. The deal lacks a takeover premium at a time when the merger market is near a record level of activity and average deal premiums hover around 20 percent, according to research firm Dealogic. Now, the market ponders whether others drugstore chains will try to follow in CVS\\' acquisitive footsteps. \"I think it definitely increases the possibility that we\\'ll see an acquisition of another PBM player, possibly by a drugstore, or at least a collaboration between the two,\" said S&P Equity analyst Joseph Agnese. COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AT RETAIL Retail pharmacies have built their own mail-order operations to try to keep pace with pharmacy benefit managers. Further adding to pressure on retailers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) has begun selling some generic drugs for just $4 for a one-month supply. \"The growth of the mail channel has been a concern to the retail pharmacies for several years,\" Cowen & Co. analyst Kemp Dolliver said. \"That\\'s the biggest thing: Mail not only takes business away from the back end of the retail pharmacy, but essentially reduces the traffic.\" Caremark and other pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug benefits for employers and major health plans, brokering deals in part by buying medicines in bulk from manufacturers. They also have large pharmacies that deliver prescriptions through the mail. \"The proposed merger of CVS and Caremark Rx signals a further shift in who controls the prescription drug market in the United States,\" said Sean Brandle, head of the Rx consulting group at Segal Co. The deal sparks longer-term questions about integration, possible customer and vendor conflicts and the potential that problems at Caremark may be driving the merger, said William Blair analyst John Kreger. In May, Caremark said the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York subpoenaed its records on stock- option grants. The Nashville, Tennessee-based company also received a letter of informal inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. John Farrall of National City Private Client Group said buying Caremark would help boost CVS\\' offerings under the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Caremark, spun off from Baxter International Inc. ( BAX.N ) in 1992, bought rival AdvancePCS for $6.7 billion in 2004. Farrall said it ranked second behind rival PBM Medco Health Solutio1ns Inc. MHS.N in terms of number of prescriptions managed. CVS has grown rapidly through acquisitions. In 2004, it acquired about 1,260 Eckerd drug stores and Eckerd\\'s mail-order and pharmacy business from J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ). Earlier this year it bought about 700 Sav-On and Osco drugstores from Albertsons Inc. and bought MinuteClinic, the biggest U.S. operator of retail-based health clinics.

In a joint statement, Caremark and CVS, the No. 2 U.S. drug store chain, said they were discussing a possible \"merger of equals\" and would not comment further. Mail-delivery prescriptions have steadily eroded the business of retail pharmacies, taking away their customers who buy medicines and also shop for other items.

Caremark\\'s market capitalization was about $21.5 billion while CVS is valued at $26.7 billion, based on Tuesday\\'s closing stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange. One arbitrage trader said he did not expect CVS to pay a large premium to Caremark\\'s stock price because the companies\\' market capitalizations are so close and they are calling it a merger, rather than a takeover. \"Any time the companies use the phrase \\'merger of equals\\' you can expect that there won\\'t be a significant premium,\" said Peter Lobravico, vice president of risk arbitrage trading and sales. Caremark shares were up $1.21, or 2.5 percent, at $50.44 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade after rising as high as $53.40. CVS dropped $2.57, or 8.2 percent, to $28.81. Premiums in a takeover are typically closer to 20 percent of the company\\'s stock price and often higher. COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AT RETAIL Caremark and other pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug benefits for employers and major health plans, brokering deals in part by buying the medicines in bulk from manufacturers. They also have large pharmacies that deliver prescriptions through the mail. \"We believe such a transaction would fit well with CVS\\'s long-term strategy to increase the size and offerings of its pharmacy benefits management business, eliminate a major competitor for its retail drug business and potentially result in scale and distribution efficiencies,\" Standard & Poor\\'s analyst Joe Agnese said in a research note. CVS and market leader Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) have said that Wal-Mart\\'s plan to offer some $4 generic drugs posed little threat to them as most of their customers are insured and shop based on convenience, not price. But one analyst said the competitive pressures were mounting. \"It doesn\\'t surprise me that retail pharmacies ... are under pressure and would want to consolidate or try to build out mail operations,\" said John Farrall of National City Private Client Group. Farrall said buying Caremark would also help boost CVS\\'s offerings under the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. The retailer already owns PharmaCare Management Services, a pharmacy benefit management, mail order and specialty pharmacy business. Caremark, which was spun off from Baxter International Inc. ( BAX.N ) in 1992, bought rival AdvancePCS for about $6.7 billion in 2004. Farrall said it ranked second behind rival benefit manager Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS.N in terms of number of prescriptions managed. In May, Caremark said the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York subpoenaed its records on stock-option grants. The Nashville, Tennessee-based company also received a letter of informal inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. CVS has grown rapidly through acquisitions. In 2004, it acquired about 1,260 Eckerd drug stores and Eckerd\\'s mail-order and pharmacy business, from J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ). The Woonsocket, Rhode Island, company bought about 700 Sav-On and Osco drugstores from Albertsons Inc. in June and MinuteClinic, the biggest U.S. operator of retail-based health clinics, in September. Both CVS and Caremark plan to report quarterly earnings on Thursday. News of their merger talks follows a spate of health-care industry deals, including the management buyout of hospital operator HCA Inc. ( HCA.N ) Among drugstore deals, Rite Aid Corp. ( RAD.N ) plans to buy about 1,858 U.S. Brooks and Eckerd drugstores from Canada\\'s Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. ( PJCa.TO ) for $2.6 billion.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court convicted former Cendant Corp. CD.N Chairman Walter Forbes on Tuesday of organizing a $14 billion fraud to inflate the real estate and travel firm\\'s profits. \\n\\n Forbes and former Cendant Vice Chairman Kirk Shelton oversaw a decade-long accounting scheme that inflated earnings and stock values of Cendant and its predecessor company CUC International, said U.S. Attorney Christopher Christie. Two previous juries could not reach a verdict on Forbes. Shelton was convicted of fraud in January 2005, when Forbes was tried for the first time. Cendant\\'s stock fell more than $19 after the falsification of its earnings was disclosed in 1998, wiping $14 billion off its market value. It was one of a series of accounting scandals that shook the U.S. corporate world. \"The innocent victims of this $14 billion fraud engineered by Walter Forbes have waited a long time for justice to be done,\" Christie said. \"This is a great day for those who believe that everyone in our society must be held accountable for their conduct.\" Forbes was convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and on two counts of making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission. He is due to be sentenced on January 17 and faces 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Shelton was sentenced in August to 10 years in prison and was ordered to pay nearly $3.3 billion in restitution, but is now free on bail as he appeals his conviction and sentence.',\n",

       "  ' OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Stung by plans for multibillion-dollar conversions to tax-advantaged income trusts, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty shocked markets on Tuesday when he announced plans to tax the sector. \\n\\n Flaherty signaled concern that the flow of conversions to income trusts could become an uncontrollable torrent that would damage the economy and erode government revenues. His new plan, which he described as a way to level the playing field between trusts and regular corporations, broke a campaign pledge by the minority Conservative government not to change rules on how Canada taxes the trusts. \"Things changed a great deal this year and we faced a situation where Canada was moving to an income trust economy. Is that a good thing for Canada?\" he said at a news conference. \"The answer is no, it\\'s a very bad thing for Canada, it\\'s bad for the Canadian economy. We\\'re concerned about competitiveness and productivity.\" Flaherty\\'s package of measures would tax distributions by income trusts while also cutting corporate taxes by half a percentage point and changing tax policy for pensioners. He said it would ease the tax burden by C$1 billion a year. Income trusts, now a C$200 billion ($180 billion) sector of the Canadian market, avoid most corporate taxes and pay the bulk of cash flow directly to investors. They have surged in popularity in recent years as investors embraced their rich yields. However, even the government admits that the structure robs it of hundreds of millions of dollars of tax revenues, and economists say the model can deplete firms\\' capital and leave them less able to invest for growth. One of the largest Canadian trusts, CI Financial Income Fund CIX_u.TO, savaged the surprise move. \"This is the most bizarre, Third-World policy that I could imagine,\" CEO Bill Holland told Reuters. \"It doesn\\'t even make sense to me -- how can they keep changing the rules?\" Flaherty said this year alone had seen C$70 billion in new conversions, and the tipping point appeared to have been trust conversion decisions by phone giants Telus Corp. ( T.TO ) and BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ). \"It was cumulative this year. It was both the quality and the quantity (of announcements),\" Flaherty told Reuters. \"It was the companies that were doing it and going to income trusts, the size of them and the fact that they\\'re not passive investment firms -- they\\'re capital-intensive firms -- and then BCE in effect feeling obliged to follow Telus.\" But now with the new set of rules, he predicted: \"Telus and BCE are not going to happen.\" The total secrecy in Tuesday\\'s announcement, as bankers and parliamentary staffers left early for Halloween, caught everybody off guard, in contrast with how the former Liberal government appeared to telegraph a decision a year ago to cut taxes on corporate dividends but to leave income trusts alone. Knowledgeable market players made tidy profits as that decision was made, attracting a police investigation that contributed to the Liberal loss in January\\'s election. \"I think this is a huge, huge surprise. Huge. I don\\'t think they consulted with anyone,\" said Calgary lawyer John Brussa, considered the father of the income trust format. \"To do this seems quite troubling, and for a government that\\'s supposed to be encouraging of business. This arbitrary action is not very conducive to business. This is going to cost a bunch of people a lot of money tomorrow.\" Flaherty said trusts that begin trading from now on would be subject to his new measures in the 2007 tax year, while existing trusts would have a four-year transition period.

       "  ' TORONTO  (Reuters) - The Canadian government\\'s plan to overhaul the rules for income trusts will change much more than just taxes and could lead to everything from a protracted dive by the Toronto Stock Exchange to smaller bonuses for Bay Street investment bankers. \\n\\n Ottawa\\'s surprise move to level the tax playing field between corporations and income trusts, announced late Tuesday, has already roiled analysts and executives preparing to cope with the possibility of an end to tax advantages enjoyed by trusts. John Brussa, a tax lawyer at Burnet Duckworth & Palmer in Calgary, who sits on a number of income-trust boards, had harsh words for the Conservative government on Tuesday. \"This arbitrary action is not very conducive to business,\" he said. \"This is going to cost a bunch of people a lot of money tomorrow.\" Two mammoth telecom conversions hang in the balance while Bay Street tries to glean more detail of Finance Minister Jim Flaherty\\'s thinking on the issue. BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ), which owns Canada\\'s largest telephone company, said earlier this month it planned to transform into a trust. The decision was timely, as its tax shelters would be fully used up in the first half of next year, triggering a mountain of taxes. BCE has estimated C$250 million in tax would have to be paid in 2007 -- soaring to C$800 million in 2008. Rival Telus Corp. ( T.TO ), which announced plans to convert exactly a month before BCE, is also likely thinking twice about such as move. Telus declined to comment on Tuesday and BCE did not return requests for comment. Along with the conversions, millions of dollars in legal and corporate-finance fees related to trust conversions -- both future and present, as well as trust initial public offerings -- are at stake for blue chip law firms and investment banks. Then, there\\'s the Toronto Stock Exchange, which relies heavily on the performance of financial and energy shares, many of which are trusts. \"This is going to be a bolt from the blue,\" said Elvis Picardo, chief market strategist at Global Securities Corp. in Vancouver. Picardo noted that the last time talk of taxing trusts began, in September 2005, the TSX saw a selloff led largely by trusts and potential conversion candidates. \"That came to an end, and the market really turned to the upside once Ottawa said that they would not be taxing trusts,\" he said. \"So, based on what we know, and based on the reaction that stocks like Telus and BCE have seen ever since they announced they\\'d be converting, I think you can expect a fairly negative reaction in the markets tomorrow.\" What\\'s more, portfolio managers may decide to sell trust holdings if the impetus for holding them -- steady and hefty distributions -- becomes negated by government tax changes. But some analysts said they remained confused by Ottawa\\'s proposals and the apparent about-face from earlier indications that the trust structure would continue to thrive. \"What is the policy? You can\\'t just flop around,\" said William Lacey, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary. ($1=$1.12 Canadian)',\n",

Softer-than-expected car sales for October also indicated a recent pullback in consumption had yet to abate. \"The broader economy is now slowing, and slowing sharply,\" said Richard Iley, senior economist at BNP Paribas. The Institute for Supply Management\\'s factory index slipped to 51.2 last month from 52.9 in September, below Wall Street forecasts and its lowest level since June 2003. The measure was close to the break-even reading of 50 that separates growth from contraction. Norbert Ore, the head of the ISM Business Survey Committee, said he would not be surprised to see the ISM figure dip into recessionary territory. The shakiness in manufacturing comes at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing considerable headwinds. Growth in gross domestic product slowed in the third quarter to a paltry annual rate of 1.6 percent, its slowest growth rate since the first quarter of 2003. U.S. stocks fell on fears of an economic downturn, while safe-haven government debt prices climbed on expectations that such softness could lead to interest-rate cuts next year. \"There is more weakness out there than the average investor realizes,\" said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance Management. The housing sector was leading the way. U.S. construction spending fell 0.3 percent in September led by a sixth straight monthly drop in private residential building. In a separate report, a real estate group said pending sales of existing homes dropped 1.1 percent in September. News from the auto industry was also not too encouraging. U.S. domestic cars and light trucks were sold at an annual rate of 12.3 million units for October, short of estimates for 12.7 million. Many economists and Fed officials had predicted a pick-up in business investment would make up for a housing-related drop in consumer spending. But the data indicate they may have been overly optimistic.',\n",

Clorox earned $112 million, or 73 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, compared with $109 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier. Oakland, California-based Clorox had projected earnings of 67 cents to 73 cents per share and analysts had expected it to earn 71 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company, whose other products include Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing and Brita water filters, said sales rose 5 percent to $1.16 billion, driven by the price increases. Volume, which excludes price fluctuations, fell 1 percent. Clorox said that shipments of Glad trash bags fell due to competitive activity after Clorox raised U.S. prices on the bags by 15 percent, on average, in February. The price hike on Glad trash bags was one of the largest percentage increases that Clorox has instituted since feeling increased pressure for materials such as resins. Gross margin increased 70 basis points to 42.9 percent, driven by the cost cuts and price increases. CIBC analyst Joseph Altobello, who has a \"sector underperformer\" rating on Clorox, said the gross margin increase was the first in seven quarters, and the results topped his forecast of 42 percent. Clorox now expects fiscal year earnings to come in at the low end of its $3.20 to $3.30 per share range. Analysts had been calling for a profit of $3.25 per share. In August, Clorox said that it could take charges to restructure its IT area and might move some of that work to a third party. It now expects 8 cents to 9 cents per share in charges from that plan this year, up from a prior forecast of 5 cents to 6 cents per share. Clorox said it still expects fiscal 2007 sales to rise 3 percent to 5 percent and sales in the current second quarter to come in at the lower end of that range. The company now expects second-quarter earnings to come in at the lower end of its 48 cents to 54 cents per share range, due to increased marketing spending. Analysts had expected Clorox to earn 54 cents per share. Clorox also gave initial guidance for the third quarter, calling for 3 percent to 5 percent sales growth and earnings of 74 cents to 80 cents per share. Analysts\\' average forecast was 82 cents per share.

The S&P/TSX income trust subindex .GSPRTCM, which tracks the prices of 75 of the 253 trusts in the market, was down 12.4 percent. The drop represented a loss of more than C$20 billion in market value for the income trusts, and more than C$24 billion including BCE and Telus\\'s losses. Ottawa said trusts that begin trading from now on will face the tax in their 2007 fiscal year, while existing trusts will have a four-year transition period. The minority Conservative government won backing for its plan from two of the three opposition parties on Wednesday. \"Foreign investors may now look at Canada as a little less secure place to invest because of the government policies that are flip-flopping,\" said Robert Lauzon, executive director and head of trading at Middlefield Capital Corp. in Toronto. \"So this may roll into a bit of a weakness in the TSX in general -- not only trusts -- because of the way the international investment community views our government and policies.\" The retreat spared few sectors, as trust-heavy oil and gas producers lost 5.1 percent, led by Penn West Energy Trust PWT_u.TO, down C$6.09, or 14.4 percent, at C$36.12, and Canadian Oil Sands Trust COS_u.TO, down C$2.71, or 9 percent, at C$27.41. Some of that money may have migrated to banks, which pay hefty dividends and are seen to benefit from the crackdown on income trusts\\' tax advantage. The big six banks gained, led by Bank of Nova Scotia ( BNS.TO ), up 80 Canadian cents, or 1.6 percent, at C$50.10.

Conglomerate United Technologies Corp. and aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. were among the Dow\\'s biggest decliners, while on Nasdaq, graphics chip maker Nvidia Corp. dragged. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 51.2 last month.

Garmin\\'s stock sank 15.8 percent, or $8.43, to $44.98 on the Nasdaq. Bucking the downward trend was Ford Motor Co., which climbed almost 3 percent, or 24 cents, to $8.52 on the NYSE after analysts noticed that the automaker is whittling down its inventories. Ford was among the stocks that helped curb the S&P 500\\'s decline. Caremark Rx Inc. fell in mid-afternoon trading after the pharmacy benefits manager and drugstore chain CVS Corp. said they would merge. Earlier, Caremark shares rallied on a report that CVS would buy Caremark. By the close, Caremark shares were down 2.2 percent, or $1.06, at $48.17, as the price paid was less than initially expected. CVS shares dropped 7.5 percent, or $2.35, to close at $29.03 on the NYSE. Dual-listed Canadian stocks traded in the United States, such as BCE Inc., fell, following the worst one-day point drop in Toronto\\'s main stock index in about 2-1/2 years.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc. said on Wednesday that profit grew at its cable and AOL Internet divisions, boosted by strong online advertising sales and new cable subscribers. \\n\\n But shares of the world\\'s largest media company fell as much as 3 percent in early trade after confusion over the presentation of its cable subscriber performance after buying the assets of bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications Corp. and investor concern over AOL\\'s Web traffic after an August restructuring. Time Warner shares recovered by midday and on Wednesday were trading down 17 cents at $19.84 on the New York Stock Exchange. Time Warner\\'s cable subscriber performance was difficult to understand as it appeared in the company\\'s financial statement because prior quarter figures were recast to reflect the change in ownership of a joint venture previously held with Comcast Corp., said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Tom Eagan. \"The results were mixed. They were more positive than negative,\" Eagan said. \"The cable numbers were a little complicated as they did not provide easily comparable pro forma metrics.\" Other analysts highlighted early signs of a turnaround at AOL, where a 46 percent rise in online advertising surpassed forecasts. \"AOL was a star for a change,\" said Christopher Marangi of Gabelli & Co., which owned 13 million Time Warner shares as of June 30. \"It appears the new strategy has taken hold.\" Time Warner, home to movie studio Warner Bros. and cable network CNN, said third-quarter net profit nearly tripled to $2.3 billion, or 57 cents per share, from $853 million, or 18 cents per share, a year ago. Results were boosted by a big gain from the purchase of Adelphia assets. Before special items, profit per share rose to 19 cents from 17 cents a year ago. The 2006 quarterly figure excludes 24 cents per share for cable systems swapped with Comcast as part of the Adelphia transaction and 14 cents per share for one-time gains like the sale of a stake in Time Warner Telecom. Revenue grew 7 percent to $10.9 billion. Wall Street analysts expected the company to post a profit of 20 cents per share, excluding items, on revenue of $11.05 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Expectations for an AOL turnaround and a cable sector stock rally have pushed up Time Warner\\'s stock price by more than 21 percent in the last three months, bringing it to a four-year high on Tuesday. AOL TRAFFIC TO IMPROVE Operating performance was led by the ad sales gain at AOL. AOL announced a major overhaul in August to turn itself into an ad-supported Internet service instead of a subscription based business. The plan includes 5,000 job cuts. AOL\\'s quarterly revenue fell 3 percent to $2 billion with the loss of 2.5 million Web subscribers. But operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) rose 21 percent to $563 million on cost cuts and the surge in ad sales. Time Warner Chief Executive Richard Parsons said the restructuring was on track to increase Web use by next year. \"Not only are former AOL subscribers coming back, a host of new first-time users are signing up,\" he told analysts on a conference call. Parsons said he expected AOL ad sales growth would meet or improve upon industry levels in 2007. But some analysts noted that AOL\\'s page views, a key measure of Web traffic, fell 5 percent in the quarter, and they questioned whether that trend could hurt growth. \"We still think AOL has significant issues facing it and it\\'s a key reason why we are unexcited about Time Warner stock on a valuation basis,\" said Pali Capital\\'s Richard Greenfield. Time Warner Cable revenue rose 44 percent to $3.2 billion and OIBDA rose 28 percent to $1.1 billion. Including the newly acquired Adelphia cable systems, the unit added 3.2 million net new basic video subscribers. Excluding Adelphia, the cable unit added 33,000 basic video customers. Time Warner purchased Adelphia this year in a deal with Comcast for around $17 billion, securing its spot as the second-largest U.S. cable operator with strongholds in New York and Los Angeles. It filed to spin off 16 percent of its cable company in October. Time Warner\\'s film division saw revenue drop 10 percent to $2.4 billion as last year\\'s strong box office sales of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and \"Batman Begins\" surpassed box office sales of \"Superman Returns\" in the third quarter. Time Warner also affirmed its expectations for 2006 adjusted OIBDA to rise in a low double-digit percentage range.',\n",
       "  \" CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ), the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain, on Wednesday posted a 12.5 percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by strong prescription drugs sales, just hours after it agreed to buy pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N in a $20.7 billion stock deal. \\n\\n Third-quarter profit was $284.2 million, or 33 cents per share, up from $252.7 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had, on average, expected the company to earn 32 cents per share. In October, CVS forecast a profit of 31 cents to 33 cents per share, citing strong business trends. CVS estimated that its acquisition of 701 Sav-on and Osco drugstores, which closed in June, hit earnings by about 5 cents per share. CVS, which typically reports its results in the morning and gives its financial forecast during a conference call later the same day, issued the results a day earlier than planned on the heels of the Caremark acquisition announcement. CVS said it would still host a call on Thursday, as previously scheduled, but that it would be a prerecorded call. In the past, the call has been live and analysts and investors were able to ask questions. As the company previously reported, quarterly sales jumped 24.9 percent to $11.2 billion, with sales at stores open more than one year up 9.1 percent. Pharmacy same-store sales rose 10.2 percent and same-store sales of general, or front-end, merchandise rose 6.4 percent. Total pharmacy sales represented 70.3 percent of CVS' total sales in the quarter. The sales continued to climb despite worries about how the new $4 generic drug plan from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) would impact the drugstore industry. Wal-Mart's $4 generic drug strategy debuted in Florida in September and expanded to more states in October. Neither CVS nor rival Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) has matched Wal-Mart's strategy, instead relying on convenient locations and businesses such as in-store medical clinics to satisfy customers' demands. Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS currently ranks behind Walgreen in terms of revenue, but has more stores. As of September 30, CVS had 6,157 stores, while Walgreen had 5,475 stores. Shares of both drugstore chains fell sharply in the days after the Wal-Mart plan was announced, and were lower on Wednesday after CVS said it would buy Caremark. Shares of CVS ended the day down $2.35, or 7.5 percent, at $29.03, while Walgreen shares fell $1.57, or 3.6 percent, to $42.11. Shares of Caremark also slipped, down 2.15 percent to $48.17.\",\n",

The trade group\\'s poll of 90 retailers found that some 95 percent have had stolen merchandise returned for a refund, the most popular form of return fraud. More than half of retailers surveyed said customers had tried to return used merchandise -- everything from already-worn party dresses to laptop computers. \"Retailers have often viewed lenient return policies as a cost of doing business with honest shoppers,\" Joseph LaRocca, the NRF\\'s head of loss prevention, said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, due to an increase in return fraud, retailers are being forced to strike a delicate balance between servicing loyal shoppers and discouraging opportunistic criminals.\" The survey found that 25 percent of retailers will be tightening their return policies this year, while 70 percent will keep them unchanged from last year. Around 5 percent planned to make the rules more lenient, giving customers extra time to return merchandise or easing rules on receipts. Returns typically spike after the holidays, with some 8.8 percent of gifts expected to be brought back this year. Normally, about 7.3 percent of purchases are returned.

Unsatisfactory performance in the United Kingdom, Germany and elsewhere in Europe constrained profits on the continent despite some progress, Chief Executive Michael Dan said during a conference call. He expects improvement in Europe, however. Third-quarter revenue from European operations was $271.2 million, up 10 percent from a year ago. \"Management has made some missteps and miscues in the last couple of years <in Europe>,\" Dan said. \"We should not have had as much volatility as we\\'ve had in the past few years.

Top PC makers including Dell Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. are recalling up to 9.6 million Sony batteries, which on rare occasions could overheat and catch fire, raising concern that production of replacement-use batteries may reduce Sony\\'s supply capability for batteries that go into new PCs.

       "  ' OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Canadian finance ministry issued the following statement relating to changes to taxation, especially of income trusts: \\n\\n The Honorable Jim Flaherty, Minister of Finance, today announced a Tax Fairness Plan for Canadians. The plan will restore balance and fairness to the federal tax system by creating a level playing field between income trusts and corporations. \"The measures I am bringing forward today are necessary to restore balance and fairness to Canada\\'s tax system, to ensure our economy continues to grow and prosper and to bring Canada in line with other jurisdictions,\" said Minister Flaherty. \"Our plan is the result of months of careful consideration and evaluation. Our actions are clear, decisive and in the best interest of all Canadians.\" For months there has been a growing trend toward corporate tax avoidance. Top Canadian companies, operating within the current rules, have announced their intention to convert to income trusts. They feel compelled to seek more favorable tax treatment by capitalizing on an available tax rule. While these decisions offer corporations short-term tax benefits, they are creating an economic distortion that is threatening Canada\\'s long-term economic growth and shifting any future tax burden onto hard-working individuals and families. If left unchecked, these corporate decisions would result in billions of dollars in less revenue for the federal government to invest in the priorities of Canadians, including more personal income tax relief. These decisions would also mean less revenue for the provinces and territories. Canada stands alone in its treatment of income trusts. The structure being used in this country was shut down in the United States and Australia. \"The landscape has changed dramatically in the short time I have been Minster of Finance, and in fact, this year we have seen nearly C$70 billion in new trust announcements,\" said Minister Flaherty. \"The current situation is not right and is not fair. It is the responsibility of the Government of Canada to set our nation\\'s tax policy, not corporate tax planners.\" The measures in the Tax Fairness Plan include: --A Distribution Tax on distributions from publicly traded income trusts and limited partnerships --A reduction in the general corporate income tax rate of one-half percentage point as of January 1, 2011 --An increase in the Age Credit Amount by C$1000 from C$4066 to C$5066 effective January 1 2006. This will benefit low and middle-income seniors --A major positive change in tax policy for pensioners. The government will permit income splitting for pensioners beginning in 2007 These measures represent a major tax reduction. Our tax fairness plan will deliver over C$1 billion of new tax relief annually for Canadians. For income trusts that begin trading after today, these measures will apply beginning with their 2007 taxation year. For existing income trusts and limited partnerships the government is proposing a four-year transition period. They will not be subject to the new measures until their 2011 taxation year. \"The time has come for Canada\\'s New Government to act,\" said Minister Flaherty. \"By introducing our Tax Fairness Plan today we are acting in the national interest, doing what\\'s right for all Canadians, and significantly enhancing the incentives to save and invest for family retirement security.\" The Tax Fairness Plan will build on the steps taken in Budget 2006. In that document Canada\\'s New Government delivered significant tax relief for Canadians with 29 tax cuts amounting to C$20 billion in tax relief over the next two years.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday put on hold sanctions imposed on cigarette makers by a judge who had found they violated racketeering laws in a decades-long conspiracy to hide the dangers of smoking. \\n\\n A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a request by the tobacco companies to stay the ruling and remedies imposed in August by District Judge Gladys Kessler. In a 2-1 decision, the appeals court judges said the tobacco companies had \"satisfied the stringent standards\" required to stay the lower court judgment while it considers the industry\\'s appeal. Kessler had ordered the companies to make \"corrective\" public statements about the health effects and addictiveness of smoking starting in December. Her order also imposed a ban on the companies that would have gone into effect on January 1 preventing them from describing cigarettes in ways that convey health claims such as \"low tar\" and \"light.\" Philip Morris parent group Altria Group Inc. said it was \"pleased\" with the appeals court action. \"The company believes the trial court\\'s decision is contrary to the law and facts presented during trial, and looks forward to the opportunity to present its arguments to the appellate court,\" Altria Associate General Counsel William Ohlemeyer said in a statement. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the appeals court action. William Corr, executive director of the anti-smoking group Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, said the court\\'s decision to grant the stay came as no surprise. \"The stay itself does not suggest that the industry is going to win anything on appeal,\" Corr said. Cigarette makers escaped major financial penalties in the August 17 ruling by Kessler, even though she found them liable for a decades-long conspiracy to hide the dangers of smoking. Kessler said in her 1,653-page opinion that the companies suppressed research, destroyed documents and manipulated nicotine levels to perpetuate addiction, but a ruling by the same appeals court prevented her from slapping the companies with costly remedies. Targeted in the 1999 lawsuit were Altria and its Philip Morris USA unit; Loews Corp.\\'s Lorillard Tobacco unit, which has a tracking stock, Carolina Group; Vector Group Ltd.\\'s Liggett Group; Reynolds American Inc.\\'s R.J.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers and consumers would face higher prices for a number of goods if Congress fails to renew a trade benefits program for developing countries that expires at the end of this year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a report on Wednesday. \\n\\n \"We\\'d like to see a full renewal of the program, with no qualifiers,\" said John Murphy, vice president for the Western Hemisphere at the business group. \"Congress should remember the Hippocratic oath of \\'first do no harm.\\'\" The 32-year-old Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program uses trade as a foreign economic development tool by waiving U.S. import duties on thousands of goods from more than 130 developing countries. However, key U.S. lawmakers are frustrated that big GSP beneficiaries like Brazil and India have resisted U.S. demands in world trade talks to open their markets to more U.S. agricultural and manufactured goods. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has threatened to let the program expire at the end of the year, while U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, a California Republican, has proposed renewing the program with changes that would reduce benefits for Brazil and India. The Bush administration favors continuing the program, but is in the midst of a review that could kick some countries out and reduce benefits for others. \"The bottom line in this report is that GSP brings significant benefits to American companies, American consumers,\" Murphy said. Congress will return to Washington for a short session after the November 7 elections. The chamber hopes lawmakers will make renewal of the program a priority, Murphy said. Among the report\\'s findings: -- GSP duty waivers help U.S. manufacturers and their suppliers remain competitive. Three-quarters of the $27 billion in goods imported under the program in 2005 were raw materials, parts and components, or machinery and equipment used by U.S. companies to manufacture goods in the United States for domestic consumption or for export. -- Finished consumer goods sold by U.S. retailers accounted for 25 percent of GSP imports in 2005. Relatively inexpensive jewelry was the most significant item. -- GSP is particularly important to U.S. small businesses, many of whom rely on the program\\'s duty savings to compete with much larger companies.',\n",

( MGM.N ), the\\nworld\\'s No. 2 casino operator, on Thursday said third-quarter\\nprofit rose a better-than-expected 68 percent on strong Las\\nVegas resort business and condominium sales.  \"Sales were pretty strong in the Las Vegas region. Even\\nmore important, margins improved,\" said James Hardiman, an\\nanalyst at FTN Midwest Securities Corp.  Net income rose to $156.3 million, or 54 cents a share,\\nfrom $93.2 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding a one-time tax gain, Las Vegas-based MGM earned\\n52 cents a share, far above the average Wall Street estimate of\\n41 cents a share as compiled by Reuters Estimates.  Revenue rose 5.6 percent to $1.9 billion.  \"Trends in the high-end segment remain strong ... We expect\\nto see continuing strength into New Year\\'s,\" said Chief\\nExecutive Terry Lanni.  He also said business from MGM\\'s mid-level and economy\\ncustomers has picked up speed, possibly because gasoline prices\\nhave moderated from the record levels seen a few months ago.  \"Our first look at MGM\\'s third-quarter (earnings) and\\nfourth-quarter outlook is that Vegas operations are excellent,\"\\nJP Morgan analyst Harry Curtis said in a research note.  MGM, which acquired Mandalay Resort Group in April 2005,\\nsaid it expects net earnings of 40 to 45 cents per share in the\\nfourth quarter. Analysts\\' average estimate is 48 cents.  Hardiman said MGM\\'s forecast likely equates to a range of\\n42 to 47 cents a share after adding some costs back in.  \"That\\'s a little beneath what I was looking for ... but\\ntheir guidance for the third quarter was 42 cents and they just\\nblew past that,\" he said.  Curtis attributed the gap between the company forecast and\\nWall Street expectations to discontinued operations and condo\\nsale proceeds. \"Adjusting for these, MGM\\'s guidance is likely 3\\ncents to 8 cents a share above the Street on a continuing\\nbasis,\" he said  GAMING REVENUE UP  MGM said third-quarter gaming revenue at casinos open at\\nleast a year rose 5 percent, helped by strong sales from slot\\nmachines and high-end table games.  In Las Vegas, slot revenue rose 15 percent at the Bellagio,\\n17 percent at Treasure Island and 12 percent at the MGM Grand,\\nLanni said.  Same-store revenue per available room, a key measure of\\nhotel performance, rose 5.5 percent at the Las Vegas Strip\\nproperties.  In addition to its Nevada operations, MGM owns a casino in\\nDetroit and has a joint venture with Boyd Gaming Corp. ( BYD.N ),\\nthe Borgata hotel-casino, in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  At the end of August, MGM reopened its Beau Rivage casino\\nin Biloxi, Mississippi, which had been closed since last year\\'s\\nHurricane Katrina.  MGM said Beau Rivage earned $16 million before interest,\\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization during the 33 days it was\\nopen in the third quarter, compared with $12 million in the\\nyear-earlier period, when it was open for two months.  MGM is constructing its 66-acre Las Vegas CityCenter\\nproject, which has an estimated budget of $4 billion, including\\nproceeds of $3 billion from the sale of condominiums.  The massive project, along with others planned by companies\\nincluding Boyd Gaming, Wynn Resorts Ltd. ( WYNN.O ) and Las Vegas\\nSands Inc.

But even after snapping up Placer Dome earlier this year to\\nbecome the world\\'s biggest gold producer, Barrick continues to\\nlook for ways to pad its portfolio.  The company entered into a preliminary agreement with\\nRussia\\'s Highland Gold Mining ( HGM.L ) and increased its\\nownership to 34 percent. Barrick is still after NovaGold\\nResources ( NG.TO ) to consolidate assets in British Columbia and\\nnab NovaGold\\'s stake in the Donlin Creek project in Alaska.  \"I think they haven\\'t finished with their acquisitions.\\nNovaGold, I think, is just a tidbit.

For the three months ended Sept. 30, Barrick earned $405\\nmillion, or 46 cents a share, up from $113 million, or 21 cents\\na share, in the year-earlier period.  Barrick said special items cut earnings by $45 million, or\\n5 cents a share.

Barrick produced 2.2 million ounces of gold in the quarter\\nat total cash costs of $281 an ounce. That compared with 1.5\\nmillion ounces at $210 an ounce a year earlier.  The jump in production was due to its recent acquisition of\\ngold miner Placer Dome.  Barrick said it expects to meet its original 2006 gold\\nproduction and cost outlook of about 8.6 million ounces of gold\\nat total cash costs of about $285 an ounce.  Barrick said it realized $581 an ounce on its gold sales in\\nthe quarter, during which it sold all its gold production at\\nspot prices.

Earnings were slightly better than analysts\\' estimates for\\nthe fiscal fourth quarter. But investors may be disappointed by\\nQualcomm\\'s first-quarter revenue forecast, which indicated it\\nmay fall short of Wall Street expectations, analysts said.  \"The stock might be a little bit weak because the top end\\nof the guidance for the December period just reaches what the\\nstreet was expecting,\" said Charter Equity Research analyst Ed\\nSnyder.  Qualcomm said net profit for its fiscal fourth quarter\\nended Sept. 24 rose to $614 million, or 36 cents per share,\\nfrom $538 million, or 32 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue\\nrose 28 percent to $2 billion.  Excluding its investment arm and other items, Qualcomm said\\nit earned 42 cents per share, edging analysts\\' average\\nexpectations of 41 cents per share and revenue of $1.97\\nbillion, according to Reuters Estimates.  Qualcomm expects fiscal first-quarter earnings of 42 cents\\nto 44 cents per share, excluding items. It forecast revenue of\\n$1.98 billion to $2.08 billion for the quarter. Analysts on\\naverage are looking for 44 cents per share on revenue of $2.07\\nbillion for the first quarter.

NOKIA DEAL DEADLINE  Qualcomm is working to renegotiate a licensing pact with\\nphone maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) ahead of an April 9 deadline. It\\nsaid it is \"not optimistic\" they  will reach an agreement in\\ntime because of the current slow progress of the talks.  If they fail to reach a deal by then and Nokia does not pay\\ntechnology royalties as a result, Qualcomm said this could\\nshave 4 cents to 6 cents per share off its earnings for the\\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  It said that risk was not reflected its 2007 forecast.  Analysts called the estimate of the potential financial hit\\n\"reasonable,\" and Snyder said Qualcomm\\'s openness about the\\nrisk should cheer investors.  \"That\\'s a good idea on their part to quantify the potential\\nimpact,\" he said.  Qualcomm stock has fallen by about 30 percent in the last 6\\nmonths, partly on uncertainty created by legal disputes with\\nNokia and other companies.  Nokia is one of several major technology companies that\\nhave complained to European regulators about Qualcomm\\'s\\ncompetitive practices.  Qualcomm dominates the market for chips based on CDMA --\\nthe most widely used mobile phone technology in the United\\nStates -- and also sells technology licenses and chips for\\nphones based on W-CDMA, a high-speed wireless technology\\npopular in Europe and other parts of the world.

       "  ' Corrects 6th paragraph to refer to Hawk missile instead of Tomahawk missile. \\n\\n By  Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. defense company Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ) is targeting Europe, the Middle East and Asia to capture a bigger share of growing worldwide demand for missile defense and homeland defense, a top company official told Reuters on Wednesday. International sales have accounted for about 18 percent of Raytheon annual revenues. \"We\\'re looking to grow that to over 25 percent ... over the next five years,\" said Torkel Patterson, a former Bush administration diplomat and national security official. He became president of Raytheon International in 2005. Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon last week reported a 7-percent increase in third-quarter revenue to $5.69 billion. Taiwan, Turkey, Singapore and India are among the many countries where Raytheon hopes to boost its business, Patterson said. North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs are fueling concern worldwide about border controls and missile defense. \"There is a lot of uncertainty in the world,\" he said, noting that with offices in 20 countries and product sales in over 70, Raytheon was well-positioned to grow internationally. The company\\'s Hawk, Standard and Patriot missiles have already given it a presence in Saudi Arabia and other countries trying to expand homeland security and missile defense. \"We are actively working our relationships. The environment in the world, terrorism and people\\'s concerns about protecting their borders, is such that there is a market,\" he said. Excluding China and Russia, all other foreign defense markets amounted to about the same size as the U.S. market, he said. \"So 25 percent is not an unrealistic effort,\" he said. India, newly opened to U.S. defense contractors, is a promising market eyeing an integrated air defense system and networked command and control systems. Raytheon was the first U.S. company to win a military sale to India after Washington lifted sanctions against the country in 2001, he said. Elsewhere in the region, Raytheon recently won deals to sell SM-2 Standard missiles to South Korea and SM-3 missile interceptors to Japan. Patterson is traveling this month to Singapore and Taiwan, where Raytheon is building a $752-million early warning radar system for Taiwan\\'s air force to detect tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and other targets. In Europe, Patterson said he would explore opportunities in Turkey during an upcoming visit. Turkey plans a missile defense competition in which Raytheon will bid its Patriot system, which uses Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) PAC-3 missiles. Loren Thompson of the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said Raytheon was hedging its bets as American sales were likely to slow after several years of strong growth. Raytheon has struggled to win a bigger share of the U.S. market but remains better known as a key subcontractor after losing several recent big systems integration contracts, said analyst Phil Finnegan of the Teal Group. Still, he said it had a good shot at expanding foreign sales, noting: \"What they sell is the sort of thing that you keep replenishing.\"',\n",
       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. is cutting benefits for U.S. salaried employees as it struggles to conserve cash after a $7.2 billion loss so far this year. \\n\\n Ford is scaling back health care benefits, raising premiums, eliminating merit pay for 2007 and delaying December paychecks by one week, Ford spokeswoman Marcey Evans said on Thursday. \"We are working hard to ensure we continue to provide competitive total compensation to our work force, while attacking our uncompetitive cost structure, including employee health care costs,\" Mark Fields, head of the automaker\\'s Americas unit, said in an e-mail to employees on Wednesday. The cuts come after Ford last week posted a third-quarter $5.8 billion loss, its largest in 14 years, as it absorbed restructuring charges, operating losses and asset write-downs. Ford lost $1.4 billion in the first half of the year. Ford has warned that operating results would weaken in the current quarter and cash flow would remain negative in the coming few years as it closes 16 plants and slashes nearly 45,000 jobs to turn around its North American unit. Evans said Ford will eliminate health insurance for Medicare eligible retirees in 2008 and raise health care premiums in June 2007 for employees by about 30 percent, the second straight year of increase. The No.2 U.S. automaker also will replace its traditional health coverage for salaried retirees over 65 with a $1,800 annual stipend that they can use to buy supplemental health coverage in addition to government-run Medicare. Ford will stop paying for any health care coverage for dependent children of retirees who are over 65, Evans said. In addition, this year, all hourly and salaried employees will also see their year-end paycheck delayed by one week. Instead of paying employees before the holidays on December 22, as is the tradition, employees will receive their salary on December 29, Evans said. \"This change alone will save the company $70 million of cash flow this year without reducing compensation to employees,\" Fields told employees in the e-mail, which was released to Reuters. Ford typically announces employee benefit changes for the following year in the fourth quarter. The company made the announcement early in the fourth quarter this year to give employees time to plan for the delayed December paycheck, Evans said. On a brighter note, Ford will reinstate matching contributions for salaried employee 401(k) retirement plans. Ford will begin contributing 60 cents per dollar up to 5 percent of an employee\\'s base pay beginning next year, Evans said. \"Earlier in the year we had conducted a survey where we asked employees to rate benefits against other benefits to find out what things in the total of the benefits were most important to them,\" Evans said.',\n",
       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan\\'s Mazda Motor Corp. ( 7261.T ) posted a 55 percent surge in quarterly operating profit on Thursday as a weak yen and sales expansion in the West offset slumping domestic demand, and it bumped up its annual forecasts beyond market projections. \\n\\n The Hiroshima-based car maker, one-third held by Ford Motor ( F.N ), has been a prime beneficiary of the yen\\'s steep decline because most of the cars it sells overseas are built in Japan. Fanning profits further, Mazda\\'s sales growth has occurred mainly in North America and Europe recently, and the yen\\'s slide has boosted the value of dollar- and euro-denominated income. For the year to March 31, the maker of the MX-5 sports coupe raised its operating profit forecast to 148 billion yen ($1.26 billion) from 135 billion yen, now calling for a 20 percent rise from last year to account for a weaker yen. The new forecast exceeds a consensus forecast of 146.2 billion yen in a survey of 18 brokerages by Reuters Estimates. Mazda joins other Japanese auto makers in posting rosy second-quarter results as they grab a bigger share of the North American and European car markets. Its fortunes stand in sharp contrast to those of Ford, which posted its largest quarterly loss in 14 years as slower truck sales and restructuring charges took their toll. Net profit is now seen at 82 billion yen in 2006/07 instead of 75 billion yen. Mazda revised its exchange rate assumptions for the year to 113 yen to the dollar and to 143 yen to the euro, from 110 and 135 assumed three months ago -- still a conservative view that leaves room for profits to overshoot the new projections. For the July-September second quarter, operating profit was 40.15 billion yen, in line with market estimates. Net profit sank 33 percent to 20.6 billion yen after Mazda booked big one-off pension-related gains the year before. Revenue grew 16 percent to 787.15 billion yen. PROFIT BEFORE SALES Mazda has won over many customers globally with the popular Mazda3 compact and the Mazda6 sedan before that, and it is hoping to repeat their successes with the new CX-7 and CX-9 crossovers -- strategic, higher-margin products aimed mainly at expanding in North America. Mazda is in the final year of a mid-term business plan under which it had targeted 100 billion yen of annual operating profit, a reduction of its debt-to-equity ratio below 100 percent and global shipment of 1.25 million units. While the first two goals have been achieved, Mazda further reduced its wholesale volume forecast for 2006/07, by 30,000 units to 1.18 million units to account for sluggish demand in Japan and Thailand. That would be up 2.7 percent from last year. But Chief Financial Officer David Friedman said the revision reflected Mazda\\'s strategy of building a stronger brand by holding down discounts and other incentives even if that meant a fall in sales volume. Kurt Sanger, an auto analyst at Macquarie Securities, agreed. \"For me, Mazda\\'s story right now is not about impressive volume growth. It\\'s about (product) mix improvement and getting more profit out of existing sales,\" he said. Indeed, Mazda said its spending on U.S. sales incentives fell to $1,790 per unit in the first half from $2,260 in the year-earlier period. Still, Mazda\\'s sales in the United States rose 3.0 percent in the first 10 months of this year. NEW MID-TERM PLAN EYED With volumes steadily growing, analysts say Mazda\\'s most pressing task now is to expand its output capacity -- now at around 1.45 million units globally -- while reducing its high sensitivity to exchange rate swings through local production. Friedman said these issues would be \"an integral part\" of the next mid-term business plan to be announced next spring, declining to provide any hints on where and how Mazda would add capacity. During the six months to September 30, Mazda\\'s shares inched up 0.1 percent, outperforming a 1.7 percent decline in Tokyo\\'s transport sector subindex .ITEQP.T. Before the results on Thursday they ended down 0.3 percent at 794 yen, while the transport sector gained 0.52 percent. ($1=117.26 Yen)',\n",

Analysts said a tie-up would most likely take the form of an offer by S&N for Biomet pitched at between $10.5 billion and $12 billion, although a deal was not certain, since the U.S. firm was also likely to attract private-equity interest. Biomet later issued a statement confirming preliminary talks with S&N but said it had not decided if it was in its interest to strike a deal with any third party. Biomet stock rose 3.8 percent to $38.83 by 1715 GMT on Nasdaq, while S&N closed 4.2 percent down at 487-3/4 pence on speculation any deal would be part funded by new shares, diluting earnings for existing shareholders in the short term. \"Biomet is an innovator in the orthopaedics space,\" S&N Chief Executive Chris O\\'Donnell told reporters. \"We are interested in innovative companies, large or small.\" But O\\'Donnell reiterated his view that it is difficult to strike successful merger and acquisition deals among big orthopaedics companies, because there are few synergies in such firms\\' biggest cost area -- their sales forces. \"We\\'ve always said this is a challenging thing to do for a prudent company like Smith & Nephew,\" he told a conference call. S&N has long been tipped as a bidder for Biomet, which hired investment bank Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) in April to consider its strategic options. A source close to the matter has told Reuters the two firms held talks this summer, but no offer was made. ING Financial Markets analyst Max Herrmann said it was no surprise S&N was talking to Biomet, but was skeptical of a deal. \"This is not the case of a company with a very low multiple like Centerpulse that was recovering,\" he said, referring to S&N\\'s failed attempts to buy Swiss medical firm Centerpulse in 2003. S&N dropped that bid after being trumped by Zimmer. Biomet shares have risen as much as 18 percent in the past month amid speculation it could attract a bid. The Financial Times said the U.S. group was also believed to have held talks with the private equity arm of JP Morgan ( JPM.N ). DEAL OR NO DEAL \"They would be lucky to get away with a 20 percent premium,\" Nomura Code analyst Michael King said of any offer by S&N for Biomet. Biomet has a market value of about $9.3 billion compared with S&N\\'s 4.8 billion pounds ($9.2 billion). S&N shares trade at about 21 times forecast earnings, compared with 20 times for Biomet, according to Reuters Estimates. King said S&N was likely to fund any deal with about $4 billion of debt and would pay for the rest either with shares or via a rights issue. Analysts also said S&N could sell Biomet\\'s dental business, which they said was worth about $2 billion. S&N reported a 6 percent rise in earnings per share before goodwill to 10.3 U.S. cents in the three months to September 30, on a 10 percent rise in revenues to $679 million, and kept its forecast for 2006 underlying earnings growth of 3 to 5 percent. Third-quarter earnings estimates ranged from 10.0 cents to 10.9 cents and revenue forecasts from $664 million to $677 million, according to a Reuters poll of six analysts. O\\'Donnell said S&N\\'s sales of orthopaedic reconstruction devices, such as replacement hips and knees, rose 13 percent in the third quarter, boosted by new launches such as Journey and Legion knees and Birmingham hips. This significantly outperformed a market growing about 7 percent, he said, adding S&N\\'s track record of outperforming rivals showed it did not need to do a deal to get bigger. \"There may be an opportunity (to do a deal), but it\\'s certainly not a problem (if S&N does not),\" he said. Goldman Sachs analysts said S&N and Biomet together would have 14 percent of the global orthopaedics market, level with Zimmer and behind Stryker and Johnson & Johnson on 15 percent. S&N said it was also reviewing all of its businesses in a bid to drive down costs and improve profit margins. O\\'Donnell declined to say if this would involve job cuts or by how much the firm hoped to lift margins. But he noted S&N generally trailed the \"best-in-class\" margins in its different businesses by between 300 and 500 basis points. (Additional reporting by Deborah Haynes and  Ben Hirschler )',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Drugstore chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) on Wednesday agreed to acquire pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N for nearly $21 billion to expand its prescription benefits and mail-order business. \\n\\n CVS will exchange 1.67 of its shares for each share of Caremark, whose stock-option practices are under federal scrutiny. CVS\\' stock fell 7.5 percent on the news, putting the value of the deal at around $20.7 billion, or $48.48 a share. The offer represents no premium to shareholders of Caremark, which traded above $49 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday and as high as $59.25 in September. The deal comes at a time when the traditional pharmacy model is under pressure from intense competition, including from mail-order operations, and new issues, such as the influx of prescriptions under Medicare Part D. Mail-order drugs have eroded the business of retail pharmacies, siphoning off customers who buy medicines and also shop for other items. CVS has been signaling they were looking to make a deal involving a PBM for the past 12 months, said Frank Sustersic, a senior portfolio manager with Turner Investment Partners. \"I\\'m not surprised that CVS is an acquirer. I\\'m a little bit surprised at the transaction price,\" Sustersic said, referring to the lack of a premium. CVS closed at $29.03, down $2.35, or 7.5 percent. Caremark shares closed down 2.15 percent at $48.17. The news also dragged down the shares of rivals in both industries, including pharmacy benefits company Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS.N, which shed 5.3 percent to $50.67, and drugstores such as market leader Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ), which fell 3.6 percent to $42.11. \"When was the last time you saw a deal that hurt everyone involved? It\\'s dragging down both companies and stocks in both sectors. How could shareholders on either side of this deal OK it?\" said one trader who declined to be named. The deal lacks a takeover premium at a time when the merger market is near a record level of activity and average deal premiums hover around 20 percent, according to research firm Dealogic. Now, the market ponders whether others drugstore chains will try to follow in CVS\\' acquisitive footsteps. \"I think it definitely increases the possibility that we\\'ll see an acquisition of another PBM player, possibly by a drugstore, or at least a collaboration between the two,\" said S&P Equity analyst Joseph Agnese. COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AT RETAIL Retail pharmacies have built their own mail-order operations to try to keep pace with pharmacy benefit managers. Further adding to pressure on retailers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) has begun selling some generic drugs for just $4 for a one-month supply. \"The growth of the mail channel has been a concern to the retail pharmacies for several years,\" Cowen & Co. analyst Kemp Dolliver said. \"That\\'s the biggest thing: Mail not only takes business away from the back end of the retail pharmacy, but essentially reduces the traffic.\" Caremark and other pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug benefits for employers and major health plans, brokering deals in part by buying medicines in bulk from manufacturers. They also have large pharmacies that deliver prescriptions through the mail. \"The proposed merger of CVS and Caremark Rx signals a further shift in who controls the prescription drug market in the United States,\" said Sean Brandle, head of the Rx consulting group at Segal Co. The deal sparks longer-term questions about integration, possible customer and vendor conflicts and the potential that problems at Caremark may be driving the merger, said William Blair analyst John Kreger. In May, Caremark said the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York subpoenaed its records on stock- option grants. The Nashville, Tennessee-based company also received a letter of informal inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. John Farrall of National City Private Client Group said buying Caremark would help boost CVS\\' offerings under the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Caremark, spun off from Baxter International Inc. ( BAX.N ) in 1992, bought rival AdvancePCS for $6.7 billion in 2004. Farrall said it ranked second behind rival PBM Medco Health Solutio1ns Inc. MHS.N in terms of number of prescriptions managed. CVS has grown rapidly through acquisitions. In 2004, it acquired about 1,260 Eckerd drug stores and Eckerd\\'s mail-order and pharmacy business from J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ). Earlier this year it bought about 700 Sav-On and Osco drugstores from Albertsons Inc. and bought MinuteClinic, the biggest U.S. operator of retail-based health clinics. Separately, CVS posted a 12.5 percent rise in third-quarter profit. Caremark posted a 24.7 percent increase in third quarter earnings.

       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Two months after his bitter break with Paramount Pictures, superstar Tom Cruise has teamed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. to revive United Artists, the fabled studio founded by four of the biggest names in early Hollywood, MGM said on Thursday. \\n\\n Under his new partnership with MGM, Cruise will produce at least four films a year for United Artists with his longtime business partner, Paula Wagner, who will oversee day-to-day operations of the studio as its chief executive officer. The pact comes after Cruise and Viacom Inc.-owned Paramount abruptly ended their 14-year-old production deal with Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone taking a parting shot at Cruise\\'s off-screen behavior, saying his \"recent conduct has not been acceptable to Paramount.\" Redstone was referring to a string of high-profile faux pas by Cruise ranging from his manic, couch-hopping profession of love for actress Katie Holmes last year on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" to his strident denunciations of psychiatry in defense of his belief in the Church of Scientology. The agreement with MGM allows Cruise, whose latest film, Paramount\\'s \"Mission: Impossible III,\" grossed more than $390 million worldwide, to star in pictures for UA while remaining available to appear in movies for other studios. \"We were looking for a strategic partner (for UA) and we\\'ve found a strategic partner and it just so happens that he\\'s the biggest star in the world,\" MGM spokesman Jeff Pryor told Reuters. Under their new deal, Cruise and Wagner will now exercise control over UA\\'s movie slate -- about four films a year to start -- from initial development to giving the go-ahead to new productions, MGM said in a statement announcing the deal. But that ability to \"greenlight\" production will be \"subject to certain parameters,\" MGM said. The new UA will remain located at the MGM studios in Los Angeles. As reconstituted, UA will function as a major supplier of feature films to MGM, with the parent studio and its equity partners fully financing production and development of those films. Privately held MGM also will handle worldwide marketing and distribution for UA films. \"The talent friendly studio will be reborn as a place where producers, writers, directors and actors can thrive in a creative environment,\" MGM said in the statement. United Artists was founded in 1919 by screen legends Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks and pioneering director D.W. Griffith -- the four biggest names in motion pictures at the time. Their goal was to give artists more control in response to the studio system that dominated Hollywood at the time. Formation of the studio elicited the famed remark from Richard A. Rowland, then president of Metro Pictures: \"So the lunatics have taken charge of the asylum.\" UA secured distribution rights to films released by MGM in 1973 and was purchased outright eight years later MGM, whose history dates to Hollywood\\'s silent movie era. Formerly a publicly company controlled by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, MGM was acquired by April 2005 by a consortium of private equity firms and media companies, including Comcast Corp and Sony Corp. MGM\\'s film library contains more than 1,200 titles, including such classics as \"Midnight Cowboy,\" \"Some Like It Hot,\" \"Annie Hall\" and the \"Rocky\" and \"Pink Panther\" movies. It also includes \"Rain Man,\" which co-starred Cruise and earned four Academy Awards, including the Oscar for best picture. In May, a USA Today/Gallup poll found that Cruise\\'s star power had waned considerably in the eyes of the public, with more than half of those surveyed registering an \"unfavorable\" opinion of the actor. Many cited his off-screen behavior during the past year, including his intense public discussions of his faith in Scientology and his blunt criticism of actress Brooke Shields for taking medication to treat postpartum depression.',\n",

The numbers compare with Wall Street forecasts for claims of 310,000. Claims for the prior week were revised to 309,000 from an initially reported 308,000 applications for aid. A Labor Department official said there were no special factors explaining last week's gain in the seasonally adjusted numbers. The four-week moving average -- regarded as a more representative gauge of underlying employment trends -- rose to 311,250 from 305,500 the week before. The number of people who remained on the benefits rolls after drawing an initial week of aid declined by 27,000 to 2.415 million in the week ended October 21, the latest week for which data are available. This was the lowest level of continued claims since the week of June 17 and compared with a consensus forecast for 2.44 million claims. The weekly jobless data were gathered too late in the month to have any bearing on October's employment report, due out on Friday. Analysts polled by Reuters expect 125,000 new nonfarm jobs were created in October, up from just 51,000 the previous month, and forecast that the unemployment rate would stay put at 4.6 percent.\",\n",

Transportation equipment jumped 28.6 percent in September after a 3.6 percent advance in August. Wall Street economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 4 percent gain in factory orders. Orders in August fell a revised 0.3 percent, previously reported as unchanged. Orders for nondurable goods, such as food and apparel, fell 4.6 percent in September after a 0.6 percent decline in August. Factory orders excluding transportation fell 2.4 percent in September while orders excluding defense-related goods gained 1.2 percent. Unfilled factory orders, a barometer of future activity, grew 3.9 percent in September, which was the 16th gain out of the last 17 months. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a gauge of underlying business capital spending, rose 2 percent after a 1.1 percent gain the prior month. Shipments at U.S. factories were down 3.5 percent in September, which was the biggest monthly decline since January 1996.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. business productivity stalled unexpectedly in the third quarter, government data showed on Thursday, while unit labor costs rose at a pace that may vex the inflation-wary Federal Reserve. \\n\\n Weekly jobless claims also increased by more than expected last week, while planned layoffs declined in October and September factory orders jumped on demand for aircraft. But the labor cost news dominated the financial markets, with U.S. Treasury note prices falling from fear of what the U.S. central bank might make of the implied wage pressures, after it warned the economy had little slack despite slowing growth. \"The unit labor costs number is a bit unsettling for the Fed,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James & Associates in St Petersburg, Florida. Fed officials worry rising labor costs may hinder a decline in inflation from levels which they have said are too high. \"So many people have focused on commodity prices, but the Fed\\'s real fear is always the labor market and the possibility of inflationary pressures developing there,\" he said. Interest rate futures slightly trimmed their implied chances for a Fed rate cut early next year. Forecasts for nonfarm business productivity had already been colored by a weak advance reading for U.S. economic output in the third quarter. Analysts had expected productivity to mount by 1.3 percent, versus a 1.2 percent gain in the second quarter. This was revised down from 1.6 percent rise previously reported. Compensation per hour grew 3.7 percent, almost half the pace in the second quarter, helping trim unit labor cost growth to 3.8 percent in the third quarter. 24-YEAR PEAK This was higher than the 3.4 percent gain forecast by Wall Street, but was an improvement on an upwardly revised 5.4 percent reading in the April to July period, in a series watched closely by the U.S. central bank. Unit labor costs are a gauge of inflation and profit pressures and they have grown 5.3 percent since the third quarter in 2005. That was the biggest gain on a quarter from the year-ago quarter since the fourth quarter of 1982, when the increase was 5.8 percent. \"The Fed has said they like to see productivity keep pace with core PCE, so to have productivity come in unchanged is a big negative,\" said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co, referring to the personal consumption expenditures price index favored by the Fed. \"I think that is going to throw some real caution to the market,\" he said. The Fed in August halted a two-year campaign of lifting borrowing costs in gradual quarter percentage point steps and has since kept its overnight fed funds rate steady at 5.25 percent, while warning that risks of inflation remain. Also, its statement following the last policy meeting on October 24-25 specifically noted that \"the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.\" This is despite a slowdown in third quarter economic growth to an annualized 1.6 percent thanks to a collapse in housing investment, because policymakers expect the fourth quarter to show a rebound in activity. WAL-MART Some economists think weakness in the housing market has already spread and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) provided more ammunition for this view. The world\\'s largest retailer on Thursday forecast flat November sales, in a pessimistic prognosis at the start of the vital holiday shopping season. Nonetheless, Fed policymakers think the U.S. is already operating near to, or even beneath, full employment -- the level at which further job growth will add to wage costs. Economists expect October\\'s employment report, due out on Friday, to show unemployment remained steady at 4.6 percent, while 125,000 new jobs were created, compared with a mere 51,000 in September. Last week\\'s jobless claims, also out on Thursday, were gathered too late to impact October\\'s jobs report. The Labor Department said the number of U.S. workers applying for jobless benefits rose 18,000 to 327,000. This was the highest level of weekly claims since the July 8 week, when they were 334,000. Wall Street expected a 310,000 reading. The four-week moving average -- regarded as a more representative gauge of underlying employment trends -- rose to 311,250 from 305,500 the week before. Offering better news for the jobs outlook, planned U.S. layoffs fell 31 percent in October from the previous month, with the biggest cuts in the automotive and retail industries. Announced layoffs totaled 69,177 in October, down from 100,315 in September, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., an employment consulting firm. In a separate release, Commerce Department data showed that new orders at U.S. factories rose 2.1 percent in September as strength in durable goods, particularly transportation, more than offset weakness in nondurable items.

Excluding interest on the loans, this amount \"represents slightly more than half\" of the $187.5 million package paid to Grasso for heading the NYSE. \"We think the motion speaks for itself,\" said a spokesman for the Attorney General. Lawyers for the NYSE declined to comment and Grasso\\'s lawyers were not immediately available for comment. Last month New York Supreme Court Judge Charles Ramos handed down a partial summary judgment that concluded Grasso violated his fiduciary duties by not keeping the Big Board\\'s directors fully informed about the compensation he had accrued over the years under various plans. Ramos ruled Grasso should return much of the $187.5 million compensation he received as the NYSE\\'s head and dismissed Grasso\\'s motions to dismiss certain claims. As part of the ruling, Ramos asked for a full accounting of the amounts that should be repaid, as supported by Grasso\\'s contracts and other NYSE documents. Spitzer, who filed suit against Grasso in 2004, last month estimated Grasso would have to repay about $100 million of his previously granted salary, bonus and retirement pay. Spitzer, who seeks election as New York governor next week, said Grasso\\'s pay was unreasonably high and violated the state\\'s laws for nonprofit organizations. Grasso was forced out of the NYSE in 2003 amid the public uproar caused by the disclosure of his pay package.

Profit dropped to $39.1 million, or 66 cents per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, from $51.8 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. St. Louis-based Energizer took charges of 23 cents per share related to its restructuring in Europe, and a charge of 6 cents per share to record foreign pension costs. Energizer said that during the current quarter it discovered that one of its international subsidiaries failed to adjust its statutory pension accounting to principles generally accepted in the United States. That led to an understatement in pretax earnings and pension liability. The company said the error was not material to previous financial statements. The charges were partially offset by 13 cents in tax benefits and adjustments. Energizer said the costs of key metals it uses to make batteries, primarily zinc, have increased significantly. Zinc prices are still rising from historic highs in 2006. At current prices, zinc costs for 2007 will be more than double 2006 rates, Energizer said. The company said if products sold during 2006 had been produced at costs expected for 2007, product expenses would have been $60 million to $65 million higher. Sales rose 5 percent to $830.1 million, driven by sales of batteries. Razor sales were essentially flat at $255 million.

With demand for the Wii already building, video game retailer GameStop and toy store Toys \"R\" Us said they had quickly run through the supply of consoles that they allotted for the early orders. The Wii launch will take place two days after Sony Corp.\\'s ( 6758.T ) PlayStation 3 hits U.S. stores, marking the start of the holiday shopping season when video game makers traditionally reap more than half of their annual sales. In a repeat of Microsoft Corp\\'s ( MSFT.O ) introduction of the XBox 360 last year, the Wii and the PS3 are expected to be in short supply as demand outstrips the companies\\' ability to turn out the new devices. The Wii comes with a motion-sensing controller that lets players simulate swinging a tennis racquet, hitting a golf ball or wielding a sword. Its $249.99 price tag is a fraction of the cost of the PlayStation 3, which is priced at $499.99 or $599.99 depending on features. Toys \"R\" Us\\' flagship Times Square store in New York and GameStop\\'s Universal CityWalk store in Los Angeles will host the official launch event. While other consumer electronics retailers, such as Best Buy Co Inc.

A GameStop spokesman said the company was not releasing any Wii allocation or reservations figures. A spokeswoman for Toys \"R\" Us said the retailer \"will be in a great stock position\" for the midnight launch. Even if GameStop and Toys \"R\" Us do not snag a better-than-average supply, aligning themselves with Nintendo and the launch publicity could help boost traffic in their stores, as customers come to them seeking the new system. Toys \"R\" Us, which has struggled in recent years with difficult market conditions for toy sellers, earlier this year installed a former Best Buy executive as president of its U.S. business and has said it is looking to expand relationships with electronics manufacturers as it tries to boost sales.

DELL.O helped limit the Nasdaq\\'s decline. \"A weak forecast by Wal-Mart, a multi-month high in the weekly jobless claims number along with rising unit labor costs have all helped contribute to a weaker trading session,\" said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at New York brokerage Spencer Clarke in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slipped 12.48 points, or 0.10 percent, to end at 12,018.54, in its longest losing streak since June 2005.

The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  ended down just 0.47 of a point, or 0.03 percent, at 1,367.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dipped a mere 0.33 of a point, or 0.01 percent, to close at 2,334.02. After the closing bell, shares of Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O sank 15.2 percent to $51.00 in composite trading after the largest natural and organic grocer\\'s CEO indicated total sales growth would be affected in fiscal 2007. The stock closed on Nasdaq at $60.12, down $3.04, or nearly 5 percent. BOEING FALLS, BUT J&J GAINS Earlier in the day, Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) reported weaker-than-expected same-store sales in October. The drop in Target sales suggested that Wal-Mart\\'s problems may be broader than first thought. Target shares fell 1.3 percent, or 74 cents, to $56.96 on the NYSE. Among the Dow\\'s biggest decliners were other blue-chip names whose fortunes are linked to economic cycles, such as Boeing Co. ( BA.N ), the big U.S. jet manufacturer, and conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ). Boeing, the biggest drag on the Dow, slid 1.1 percent, or 86 cents, to $79.20. Honeywell dropped 0.8 percent, or 33 cents, to $41.87. General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), another conglomerate whose businesses range from making jet engines and light bulbs to providing news and entertainment, fell 0.5 percent, or 19 cents, to $34.71. But some investors snapped up stocks of companies that benefit from a slowing economy, including Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), which rose 1.1 percent, or 72 cents, to $67.90. J&J contributed the most to curbing the Dow\\'s decline. INTEL DROPS AFTER DOWNGRADE Dell shares rose 3.3 percent, or 78 cents, to $24.80 and ranked among the biggest advancers in the Nasdaq 100 .NDX. Analysts at Goldman Sachs & Co. raised the rating on the personal computer maker\\'s stock to \"neutral\" from \"sell.\"  Meanwhile, Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) fell 1.6 percent, or 34 cents, to $20.68 on Nasdaq after Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on the stock to \"neutral\" from \"buy\". Intel was the heaviest weight on both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500. It also dragged on the blue-chip Dow. Trading volume was heavy on the NYSE, where about 1.68 billion shares changed hands, above last year\\'s daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.00 billion shares traded, above last year\\'s daily average of 1.80 billion. Decliners outpaced advancers on the Big Board by a ratio of about 5 to 4. On the Nasdaq, seven stocks fell for every five that rose. (Additional reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch )',\n",

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc. is going into the food business. \\n\\n The Sunnyvale, California-based company said on Wednesday it was offering Yahoo users thousands of recipes, advice from regional celebrity chefs, video cooking guides and easy-to-use Web tools to help cooks answer the daily question: What\\'s for dinner? The Web media giant is looking to create a new lifestyle business in a category that, while well-established in Internet terms, is largely fragmented among food industry players and niche recipe sites, with few big independent media players. Yahoo Food ( food.yahoo.com/ ) will be served up to the U.S. market initially. Early in 2007, it aims to move into other English-speaking countries like Australia, Britain and Canada, then expand into other global markets, officials said. Among Web users, the U.S. food reference category is dominated by cable television\\'s Food Network, suppliers such as Kraft Foods, BettyCrocker.com and Williams-Sonoma and specialist cook sites like Cooks.com and Epicurious, according to U.S. data from audience measurement firm Hitwise Inc. Other than the Food Network, independent media companies are not big players online. AOL Food is active but has a tiny market share, according to Hitwise. Gadget review company Cnet Networks Inc. recently relaunched Chow.com. \"This is very much of an extension of Yahoo\\'s media business,\" Deanna Brown, general manager of Yahoo Lifestyles, said in an interview. \"It\\'s a very compelling experience for Yahoo advertisers.\" It\\'s a category Brown knows about as well as anyone. She founded Epicurious in 1995. She went on to launch AOL Food. A year ago, she was hired to develop Yahoo\\'s lifestyle business. Media partners include Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. , Wolfgang Puck, Everyday with Rachael Ray, Food & Wine, Epicurious, allrecipes.com, Cook\\'s Illustrated, Eating Well, Taste of Home, and Reader\\'s Digest. Yahoo offers a searchable recipe database, personalized features that remind Yahoo users of their prior searches for recipes or articles on the site, and a potentially vast social network of people united by common interests around food. It\\'s Yahoo, so search underpins the workings of the site. The technology indexes thousands of recipes via a partnership with allrecipes.com. Users can search by ingredient, cuisine, foods for special occasions, or by taste or mealtimes. Food joins technology as the first of two in a line of new lifestyle businesses that Yahoo is developing to both drive greater usage of its network of sites among existing customers and woo attractive new online demographics -- the hungry, in this case -- that its blue-chip advertiser base covets. Yahoo Tech and Food are the first new Yahoo media properties launched in five years. Since it was introduced earlier this year, Yahoo Tech has grown to become one of the top three U.S. properties in the gadget review category. \"We think we will go to No. 1 with some promotions we are doing over the holidays,\" said Scott Moore, Yahoo\\'s vice president of content operations, based in Santa Monica. \"In the next six months, we will have several launches, new categories or extensions of existing categories,\" he promised. Moore estimates Yahoo Tech already attracted around 2.5 million monthly users. \"One of the reasons we did Tech was not that it was a big user category, but it is massive with advertisers,\" he said.',\n",
       "  ' SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Once bitter rivals, Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) and Novell Inc. NOVL.O entered into an agreement on Thursday to allow open-source Linux software to work with Microsoft\\'s Windows software. \\n\\n After years of trying to crush open-source rivals, Microsoft said it will provide support and technology to allow Linux to work on Windows while agreeing not to assert patent rights over technology that may be included in Suse Linux, a version of the operating system sold by Novell. In its second major partnership with an open-source software company this week, Microsoft sought to assure a growing number of Linux users, especially in the computer server market, that the two technologies can work together. \"We appreciate that open-source software plays an important role in our industry and it\\'s here to stay,\" said Brad Smith, Microsoft\\'s general counsel. \"This will enable a new level of cooperation between open source and proprietary software.\" Unlike proprietary software, open-source software lets developers share code and add functions. Users pay for custom features, maintenance and technical support. Linux is the most popular variant of open-source software. The Microsoft partnership gives Novell an advantage over open-source rivals and Linux leader Red Hat Inc. RHAT.O since corporate customers increasingly run both Windows and Linux machines. The agreement comes two days after Microsoft struck a long-term partnership with open-source software maker Zend. News of the Novell partnership sent Novell\\'s shares up 16 percent while pushing Red Hat stock down 2 percent. Microsoft shares were mostly unchanged. \"Linux has grown up,\" said Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. who covers Red Hat and Novell. \"This is a mainstream technology that major technology vendors are struggling to find a way to support.\" Microsoft is not the only software giant eyeing Linux. Last week Oracle Corp. ORCL.O made its boldest move yet into Linux software, offering cut-price technical support in a surprise bid to wrest away Red Hat customers. The Microsoft-Novell pact, which will run until at least 2012, is a broad set of business and technological agreements to make Novell and Microsoft products work better together, the two companies said. The agreement focuses on three main technological areas: virtualization to allow Linux to run on Windows machines and vice versa, Web services to help customers with a mix of Linux and Windows products, and document format compatibility to allow users to share documents. \"Customers continually ask us how they can consolidate servers with multiple operating systems through virtualization,\" said Jeff Jaffe, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Novell. According to industry data from Gartner, 21 percent of worldwide server shipments in 2005 run Linux versus 67 percent of servers running Windows. Linux has continued to gain market share in recent years. More than a decade ago, Novell assembled the pieces of a full-scale Microsoft competitor by buying database software from Borland and WordPerfect, an alternative to Microsoft Word. It bought rights to a rival to Microsoft\\'s Disk Operating System (DOS) and a version of Unix, a predecessor to Linux, seeking to fuse them with Novell\\'s own operating system. But the strategy failed amid surging demand for Windows, leading Novell to file an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. Two years ago Microsoft paid $536 million to Novell to settle part of those claims. Shares of Novell rose 15.67 percent, or 92 cents, to $6.79, while Red Hat shares fell 2 percent, or 33 cents, to $16.10 in regular Nasdaq trade. Microsoft shares fell 4 cents to $26.77.

       "  ' AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch retailer Ahold NV posted a marginal rise in third-quarter sales on Thursday, but investors focused on the performance at its U.S. Foodservice business amid expectations of its imminent sale. \\n\\n Ahold, the world\\'s fourth-biggest food retail and food service group by sales, will present a long-anticipated retail review on Monday, with analysts expecting the sale of underperforming assets and cost cuts. \"We expect the intention to sell U.S. Foodservice and (U.S. retail chain) Tops as well as possibly the stake in (Nordic retailer) ICA. Today\\'s sales numbers ... bode well for their potential value,\" Kempen analyst Erwin Dut wrote in a note. Ahold, which generates about 74 percent of its turnover in the United States, is struggling to get back on track after an accounting scandal in 2003 centred on U.S. Foodservice, its catering supplies business. Barclays Capital told investors in a call last week that the most likely outcome of the review would be for Ahold to sell U.S. Foodservice and central European operations and return money to shareholders. JP Morgan said in a note it also expected Ahold to state its U.S. Foodservice was non-core, while Fortis Bank saw Ahold focusing on the sale of its central European business. The U.S. unit, valued by analysts at between 3.8 billion euros ($4.9 billion) and 5.2 billion, is seen as having few synergies with Ahold\\'s core retail activities, while the central European business remains loss making. In the credit derivatives market, the cost of insuring Ahold\\'s debt against default fell, with traders saying debt investors were also anticipating news of asset sales. MERGER POSSIBILITY U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice is interested in Ahold, a person familiar with the matter said, while cautioning it was not in talks with the retailer. The Financial Times earlier reported talks were underway. Ahold declined comment on the report. U.S. Foodservice had a turnover of 3.57 billion euros in the third quarter, up 0.8 percent. Hedge funds Centaurus Capital and Paulson, which together hold a 6.4 percent stake in Ahold, have urged the company to sell its U.S. activities to unlock value. Analysts said a slimmed-down Ahold could pave the way for a merger or alliance with smaller Belgian rival Delhaize, but this would take some time. \"Ahold will become much smaller, and then we could see a merger on the basis of equals. The probability is increasing of this. It also makes sense geographically,\" said one Brussels-based trader. Ahold said third-quarter revenues rose 0.7 percent to 10.3 billion euros, compared with an average forecast of 10.18 billion in a Reuters poll of 13 analysts, as rising competition in the U.S. hurt margins, offsetting its robust Dutch unit. \"Overall sales were slightly better than consensus, mainly thanks to Albert Heijn in the Netherlands. The U.S. retail business remains weak, and U.S. Foodservice was only marginally better,\" said Petercam analyst Stefaan Genoe. Subsidiary Albert Heijn, the Netherlands\\' biggest supermarket chain and one of Ahold\\'s most lucrative businesses, increased sales by 10.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros. Ahold shares were up 0.2 percent at 8.35 euros by 1210 GMT, erasing earlier gains but slightly underperforming a 0.3 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European retail index. Delhaize was 0.32 percent lower. Buoyed by merger speculation, Ahold is trading at 40 times estimated 2006 earnings against 17 times for the DJ Stoxx index of European retailers, according to Reuters Estimates. Five-year credit default swaps on Ahold fell 8 basis points to 105 basis points, a high-yield trader in London said, meaning it costs 105,000 euros a year to insure 10 million euros of its debt against default.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. specialty apparel retailers, including Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) and Chico\\'s FAS Inc. ( CHS.N ), posted surprisingly weak October sales on Thursday as a lack of fresh merchandise kept consumers from buying after they loaded up on fall fashions in September. \\n\\n Analysts and investors, who had anticipated that cold weather would drive shoppers into malls, were disappointed when companies missed their sales forecasts; shares of many retailers tumbled in early Thursday trading. \"(Investors) had been piling in, and now they\\'re probably going to pile out,\" said Morgan Keegan analyst Brad Stephens. \"Even if weather drove people into stores, there was nothing new there to buy.\" Analysts also noted that companies hurt demand by offering less clearance merchandise. Shares of Gap sank 7.1 percent after the owner of the Banana Republic, Old Navy and Gap clothing chains said sales at stores open at least a year dropped 7 percent, even after a heavily promoted line of new skinny-leg jeans and its RED campaign for socially-responsible apparel manufacturing had drummed up interest. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the San Francisco-based company to post a same-store sales decrease of 2.3 percent, according to a Reuters survey. Of 27 apparel retailers tracked by Retail Metrics, 15 reported same-store sales that missed forecasts, the research firm said. Gap competitor Limited Brands Inc. ( LTD.N ) bucked the negative trend with October sales that rose more than analysts expected on soaring demand for its Victoria\\'s Secret intimate apparel and Pink casual clothing line. The company also gave a third-quarter profit forecast ahead of Wall Street\\'s expectations, sending shares up 2 percent. But Chico\\'s sagged 8 percent after the company, known for clothes designed for women age 35 and over, posted a surprising decline in same-store sales. The company called its results \"disappointing\" and cut its third-quarter earnings estimate. AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ) also posted a surprising same-store sales decline for the month after customers rejected its sweater offerings. PRICED FOR PERFECTION? The Dow Jones U.S. retail and apparel index .DJUSRA had climbed almost 16 percent this year through Wednesday, and rose 7 percent in September alone. Many investors jumped into battered retail stocks after energy prices fell, betting that consumer spending would pick up. While spending had been strong, the companies\\' profits likely can\\'t justify a soaring stock price, Stephens said. \"The shares got ahead of themselves,\" he said. \"A lot of companies were priced for perfection and it\\'s not going to be perfection.\" On Wednesday, Gap was selling for 16.5 times next year\\'s expected earnings. In June, the stock sold for 12.3 times its forecasted profit. Teen retailers fared slightly better in October, though their results also missed many expectations. American Eagle Outfitters Inc. AEOS.O late on Wednesday raised its third-quarter profit forecast after October sales exceeded the company\\'s expectations. But the same-store sales gain still missed Wall Street expectations, as did that of trendy apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( ANF.N ). \"They have had great comps, but you can\\'t count on that forever,\" said Morningstar analyst Brady Lemos. \"Whenever they stumble, they\\'ll get hit really hard (by investors).\" The stock had been up 21 percent for the year on October 30.

Same-store sales rose just 2 percent at its U.S. stores, while the international business reported an 11 percent jump, with particular strength in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Britain. Net sales rose 8 percent to $4.59 billion for the four weeks ended October 29, 2006. On a recorded message detailing its October sales performance, Costco said falling gasoline prices shaved 1.5 percentage points off of its same-store sales total. The average price per gallon of gasoline it sold in the October period was $2.25, well below last year\\'s $2.63. Falling gasoline prices tend to hurt Costco\\'s sales but boost profitability.

According to research firm Retail Metrics, 61 percent of retailers missed analysts' sales expectations. Drugstores and department stores were the only two sectors to come in ahead of same-store sales forecasts, the firm said. The results also put to rest initial fears that Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s ( WMT.N ) $4 generic drug plan would crimp sales at the traditional drugstore chains. CVS Chief Financial Officer David Rickard said his company has seen little impact so far from Wal-Mart's plan, which debuted in Florida in September and was rolled out to more states in October. Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ), the No. 1 U.S. drugstore chain in terms of revenue, said same-store sales rose 11.4 percent, and total sales were up 18.2 percent to $4.31 billion. Analysts, on average, expected Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen's same-store sales to rise 9.5 percent, according to Retail Metrics. CVS said same-store sales gained 9.3 percent in October, while analysts expected a rise of 8.2 percent, according to Retail Metrics. Total revenue at CVS jumped 24.4 percent to $3.5 billion for the four weeks ended October 28. At Rite Aid Corp.

Rite Aid's total drugstore sales rose 4.2 percent to $1.32 billion for the four weeks ended October 28. CVS KEEPS VIEW CVS said its same-store sales should rise 6 percent to 8 percent in the current quarter, and 7.5 percent to 8 percent for the full year. The company expects to earn 41 cents to 43 cents per share in the fourth quarter, bringing full-year earnings to $1.52 to $1.54 per share. Analysts, on average, had been expecting CVS to earn 43 cents per share in the fourth quarter, and $1.54 per share this year, according to Reuters Estimates. Walgreen rose 32 cents at $42.43, while Rite Aid added 8 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $4.60, and CVS stock was up 1 cent at $29.04 after rising to $29.50 in early trading, all on the New York Stock Exchange. CVS had 6,172 stores as of October 28, while Walgreen had 5,515 stores as of October 31. Rite Aid trailed with 3,317 stores as of October 28. But the Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company plans to buy the U.S. Eckerd and Brooks chains from Canada's Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. ( PJCa.TO ).

( GPS.N ) on Thursday said sales at stores open at least a year fell a greater-than-expected 7 percent in October as revamped stores and merchandise failed to attract shoppers. \\n\\n Investment bank Citigroup cut its rating on the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy,\" saying it was concerned that weakness at the Old Navy chain would likely continue into 2008 after a slew of management changes. Gap Inc. has lost its footing as discount department stores such as Target Corp ( TGT.N ) have stolen away shoppers with lower clothing prices. Also, Gap\\'s shift to more fashionable offerings, away from jeans and T-shirt basics, has confused previously loyal customers. Though the operator of the Banana Republic, Old Navy and Gap chains has rolled out aggressive ad campaigns, brought in a slew of new designers and streamlined its inventory systems, sales have continued to slide. \"The Oprah bounce was not enough,\" Lazard Capital Markets analyst Todd Slater wrote in a research note, referring to an Oprah Winfrey talk show that featured the company\\'s Red apparel line and drove some traffic to Gap stores. Gap shares were down $1.14, or 5.4 percent, to $19.50 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. SALES DISAPPOINT Analysts, on average, had expected the San Francisco-based clothing retailer to post a same-stores sales decrease of 2.3 percent for October, according to a Reuters survey. During October 2005, same-store sales fell 5 percent. Gap said total sales for the four weeks ended October 28 declined 3 percent to $1.25 billion. In North America, same-store sales fell 4 percent at Gap, rose 2 percent at Banana Republic, and dropped 11 percent at Old Navy. Sales at international stores declined 8 percent. For the third quarter, which also ended October 28, total net sales were flat at $3.86 billion. Analysts had expected $3.84 billion. Gap said it expects third-quarter earnings of 21 cents to 23 cents per share, including a benefit of 1 cent from a tax rate adjustment. Analysts were expecting 23 cents per share. Total merchandise margins rose from a year earlier, Gap said, without elaborating. Analysts scrutinize margin trends to help determine how much the company is selling at full price. \"Although increased advertising expenditures did not materially lift traffic and (comparisons with a year earlier), we continue to see evidence of progress at Gap brand and Banana Republic,\" Slater wrote. \"Margins were up in each of the three months, and when product was right, sales improved.\" The company has highlighted skinny-legged black pants in a TV commercial featuring actress Audrey Hepburn, and has heavily promoted its Red line of clothing. A portion of the proceeds from Red sales goes to a fund to fight AIDS in Africa. Gap shares rose throughout September and October as investors bet on a company revival. The stock jumped 11 percent in October alone. But that optimism may have come too early, Citigroup analyst Kimberly Greenberger said. \"The 25 percent increase in the stock over the past two months has discounted much of the improvement...,\" she wrote in a note to clients. \"We remain skeptical that new leadership at Old Navy will be able to impact the business before the first half of 2008.\" Gap shares are selling for 16.6 times estimated 2007 earnings, in line with an average multiple of 17 for companies in the Dow Jones retail index .DJUSRA.',\n",

The move had little impact on shares in Seven & I, but rival bottled tea makers such as Ito En Ltd. ( 2593.T ) and Asahi Soft Drinks 2598.T took a hit. Minoru Matsumoto, a spokesman at Seven & I, parent of Seven-Eleven Japan, said it will choose outlets to offer the tea drinks depending on store locations and customers. He estimated the new products will contribute to around 1-2 percent of soft drink sales at each store, which make up about 10 percent of overall sales. Lawson Inc. ( 2651.T ), Japan's second-biggest convenience store chain, said it has not yet decided whether it would also introduce cheaper bottled drinks, while third-ranked FamilyMart ( 8028.T ) said it does not immediately plan to follow suit. Japanese convenience stores continuously logged a fall in same-store sales since August 2004 except last June when strong tobacco demand ahead of a July tax hike boosted sales. Shares in Seven & I were unchanged at 3,690 yen as of 0149 GMT. Ito En was down 2.7 percent at 3,580 yen, while Asahi Soft Drinks was down 2 percent at 1,634 yen. Lawson was up 0.5 percent at 3,990 yen and FamilyMart was up 2.9 percent at 3,200 yen. The Nikkei average  .N225  was down 0.67 percent. ($1=117.04 Yen)\",\n",

The Topeka, Kansas-based company also benefited from the higher prices it placed on the trendier items it has been selling for the last year, said Susquehanna Financial analyst Chris Svezia, who has a \"neutral\" rating on Payless stock. \"There\\'s been some change in the type of consumer they\\'ve been getting in the store, who\\'s buying this type of product,\" Svezia said. \"But at the same time, the overall units going out the door has declined ... Given the fact that Payless is more of a discounter, or mass merchandiser in terms of the product they sell, we would like to see unit growth, not just increases in the average selling prices.\" Payless stock, which trades at 17.79 times estimated earnings for 2006, is more than fairly priced compared to its peers, Svezia added. Based on its sales results, Payless said it expects third-quarter earnings to be 43 cents to 46 cents a share. Analysts, on average are expecting Payless to earn 41 cents a share for the third quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said its estimate includes a tax benefit of 2 cents to 3 cents a share, as well as $2 million in exit costs resulting from its suspension of retail operations in Japan, where it had one test location. Payless, which is scheduled to release third-quarter results November 21, also said it will no longer be issuing a quarterly sales release.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. retailers posted disappointing October sales on Thursday, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) forecast flat November sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, raising fears about the critical holiday shopping season. \\n\\n But analysts said the lackluster October results may have stemmed from consumers taking a breather after spending heavily for back-to-school merchandise in September, and might not signal weak holiday trends. \"It\\'s possible that September was so strong that it pulled in some sales from October,\" said Sarah Henry, investment analyst with Sovereign Asset Management, which holds Wal-Mart and Target shares. Wall Street was expecting retailers to post solid October sales on the heels of lower gasoline prices and cooler temperatures. Early wintry weather descended on the Midwestern and Eastern United States, making last month the third-coldest October in 10 years, according Planalytics. Fuel prices also remained low, with the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline at $2.22, close to the lowest level since last December, according to the most recent weekly report from the Energy Information Administration. But 61 percent of U.S. retailers reported October sales below expectations, according to Retail Metrics. In a bright spot, department store operators Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) and Nordstrom Inc. ( JWN.N ), which have focused on increasing their selection of fashionable merchandise, posted strong gains. But many retailers have struggled with fall fashions, and specialty apparel retailers like Chico\\'s FAS Inc. ( CHS.N ), Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) and American Eagle Outfitters AEOS.O reported sales below Wall Street expectations. BROADER SLOWDOWN? Wal-Mart earlier disappointed investors with preliminary October sales growth of just 0.5 percent at U.S. stores open at least a year, its smallest gain in more than two years and below company expectations. Since the report on October 28, investors have been trying to determine whether Wal-Mart\\'s problems are its own or a sign of a broader spending slowdown. Wal-Mart, which is looked at as a bellwether for the sector, is struggling with selling trendy merchandise and remodeling its stores, which has hurt sales. On Thursday, Wal-Mart was joined by Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) and Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) in reporting lower-than-expected October sales, with all three facing tough comparisons from strong monthly sales a year ago. Pat Conroy, vice chairman of Deloitte & Touche USA\\'s consumer business practice, said October sales likely got squeezed by the awkward time period between back-to-school shopping and the holiday gift-giving season. He now expects retailers to promote heavily to drive sales this holiday season to convince consumers to spend holiday cash sooner rather than later. \"What we think they really need to focus on this year is to make sure that they convert the shoppers,\" he said. \"Shoppers again this year will be visiting less stores and so once you\\'ve got them in that store, you\\'ve really better have a good customer experience to convert them into a buyer.\" Wal-Mart has already slashed prices on more than 100 toys and games, setting the stage for a competitive holiday season.

Total sales rose 11.7 percent to $25.71 billion for the four-week period ended October 27. Wal-Mart has struggled with tepid demand for its trendy clothing, and acknowledged that styles such as skinny jeans did not resonate with its core customers. \"We\\'re continuing to work longer-term to improve the balance between fashion and core essentials in our stores,\" Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said in a statement. Remodeling projects at hundreds of its stores also hurt sales, although Wal-Mart said it would wrap up those efforts in the next two weeks so stores would not be disrupted during the holiday shopping season. Wal-Mart has vowed to aggressively cut prices during the holiday season, and started last month by lowering prices on more than 100 toys and games. Schoewe said price cuts boosted sales volume, and Wal-Mart was pressing ahead with plans for similar holiday season specials on key electronics. \"We have expanded our (electronics) brand offerings, improved our product presentations in the store, reinforced our value pricing and doubled the assortment of accessories,\" he said.

Executives also said they saw no harm to Medco coming from\\neither a recent move by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) to sell\\nsome generic drugs for $4 per prescription, or a potential\\nlegal settlement that could lower an industry benchmark price.  Medco\\'s solid results come during a volatile time for\\npharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, after rival Caremark Rx\\nInc.\\'s CMX.N agreement on Wednesday to be acquired by the No.\\n2 U.S. drugstore chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) for nearly $21 billion\\n-- valuing Caremark without a premium to its shares.  Medco shares opened up as much as 4.1 percent, but then\\nreversed their gains and traded off 2.4 percent.  \"Clearly, the CVS-Caremark merger is the big event in this\\nspace,\" said William Blair & Co. analyst John Kreger, who\\nfollows the PBM industry. \"It dominates any of the nuances we\\nare seeing in quarterly earnings.\"  Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug\\nbenefits for employers and health plans, brokering deals in\\npart by buying medicines in bulk from manufacturers. They\\noperate large pharmacies that deliver prescriptions by mail.  Third-quarter net income rose to $186 million, or 62 cents\\nper share, from $157 million, or 53 cents per share, a year\\nearlier.  Excluding 9 cents in amortization of intangible assets,\\nearnings were 71 cents per share. Medco also said it got a\\n2-cent-per-share tax benefit in the quarter.  Analysts, on average, expected 69 cents per share,\\naccording to Reuters Estimates.  Net revenue rose 12.2 percent to nearly $10.5 billion.  The Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company dispensed 22.3\\nmillion prescriptions through its mail-order pharmacies, up 4.2\\npercent. Total prescription volume, adjusting for the\\ndifference in supply days between mail and retail, increased\\n3.3 percent to 179.2 million.  Medco said its rate of dispensing generic drugs -- an\\nimportant profit generator -- is at record levels because of\\nthe availability of generic versions of blockbuster medicines\\nsuch as the anti-depressant Zoloft and cholesterol treatment\\nZocor.  The Caremark-CVS deal further rattled investors, who had\\nbeen worried about potential pricing pressure from the Wal-Mart\\nmove and the possible change to the price benchmark.  Medco CEO David Snow told analysts on a conference call he\\ndid not see any harm to business coming from Wal-Mart\\'s move,\\ncalling it a strategy designed to bring customers into the\\nretail giant\\'s stores.  Snow also said a potential legal settlement that could\\nlower the price benchmark -- known as Average Wholesale Price\\n-- would not have a material effect on profitability. He said\\nMedco\\'s contracts with its clients lock in the financial\\narrangements in the event of a change to the benchmark.  Snow said the company was still doing its \"homework\" on the\\nCaremark-CVS deal, but that Medco is \"the best asset by far in\\nthe space.\"  \"Clearly, this whole thing will be watched,\" Snow said. \"I\\nthink, frankly, a company like Medco is in a very good position\\nrelative to these dynamics, and it will create opportunity in\\nmany different ways.\"  Medco forecast 2006 earnings per share of $2.33 to $2.36,\\ncompared with its prior view of $2.26 to $2.35, excluding a\\ncharge from a legal settlement.  Excluding the legal charge and amortization in intangible\\nassets, Medco forecast 2006 earnings of $2.69 to $2.72 per\\nshare. Analysts expected $2.67.  Medco projected 2007 GAAP earnings of $2.76 to $2.83 per\\nshare, or $3.12 to $3.19 excluding the amortization of\\nintangibles. Analysts expect $3.13.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Several major U.S. airlines have raised fares in some markets by $5 each way, after two unsuccessful efforts to hike prices in recent weeks. \\n\\n AMR Corp.\\'s American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc. each said on Friday that they raised fares in domestic markets not served by low-cost carriers. The increases affect walk-up and advance purchase tickets, according to FareCompare, an airfare tracking company. If the price increase holds, it would mark the first broad fare increase since August when tighter security measures were implemented following a foiled plot to blow up planes. Attempts at broad-based fare increases have failed in recent weeks, with companies rescinding hikes twice in targeted markets after low-cost carriers and some traditional airlines did not match the increases. But unlike recent attempts to increase fares, the latest effort, which affects more markets, is expected to hold because it is not dependent on low-cost carriers playing along. \"Discounters are incapable of acting as spoilers,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a note. \"We ascribe a high probability of success to this increase.\" UAL Corp\\'s United Airlines and Northwest Airlines said they are studying the fare increase and had not matched it. UAL added that it increased fares by $25 to $50 on Thursday for one-way trips in about 50 markets where the airline faces low-fare competition. Those fare hikes apply only to last-minute walk-up purchases. Airlines have used fare increases to offset the high price of oil. The latest efforts to raise ticket prices come after jet fuel prices have retreated from historical highs this summer.

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Computers may be the last thing left on the shelves this holiday season as the delayed release of Microsoft\\'s Vista operating system, laptop battery recalls and other challenges dent U.S. sales, analysts said. \\n\\n Personal computer makers, such as Dell Inc. DELL.O and Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ), usually count on the year-end consumer spending spree to boost revenue, but this year, a number of factors are combining to dampen the holiday cheer. Declining U.S. home prices and slowing economic growth are tightening purse strings just as PC makers hope consumers will spend more for advanced processors, memory, monitors and disk drives to take advantage of new features in Vista, set for release in January, analysts said. A worldwide recall of nearly 10 million battery cells used in notebook PCs sold by Dell, Apple Computer Inc. ( AAPL.O ), Toshiba Corp. ( 6502.T ) and others has led to shortages and potential shipment delays. The battery cells, made by Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ), were at risk of overheating. \"Microsoft having missed the holiday season for consumers is going to put a pretty good dent into spending by consumers for PCs,\" said Roger Kay, president of market researcher Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. Some PC makers and retailers are responding to the Vista delay by offering Microsoft-issued ( MSFT.O ) coupons for low-cost upgrades to the new operating system, and cutting computer prices to entice buyers. But research firm Current Analysis, which tracks weekly PC sales, estimates that consumers will hold off buying high-end PCs until after Vista. It forecast 70 percent of notebooks sold this holiday season will be priced below $1,000, compared with 58 percent a year ago and 38 percent in 2004\\'s holiday season. \"We expect to see a lot of activity at the low end of the consumer side,\" said Samir Bhavnani, research director for computing and storage at Current Analysis. \"A lot of the mid-tier and upper-tier customers are going to delay purchases until the first quarter of next year.\" The No.2 contract laptop maker, Taiwan\\'s Compal Electronics Inc. ( 2324.TW ), which supplies brands like Dell and HP, last week said demand in the fourth quarter is strong but component shortages, especially for batteries, will affect its output. Dell spokesman Bob Pearson said the company\\'s recall of 4.2 million Sony-made battery cells had not led to shortages. \"We were pretty prepared going into the recall,\" he said. Dell is offering free upgrades to Vista for buyers of systems with Windows XP Media Center or Professional editions, though there will still be shipping and handling charges. Despite these kinds of promotions, industry indicators show PC demand is slowing and may not pick up for the holidays. Demand for motherboards, the computer circuit boards that contain the microprocessor and memory, \"is falling off a cliff,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Henry King wrote in a research note last week. He cut his fourth-quarter motherboard shipment growth forecast to 8.8 percent from 10.8 percent in the third. According to market researcher IDC, PC shipment growth slowed to 7.9 percent in the third quarter, from double-digit percentage growth in the prior three years. The battery recalls may cut into fourth quarter growth, IDC said. Bank of America on October 31 cut its 2006 PC growth forecast to 9.4 percent from 10 percent. All this suggests that consumers looking for bargain gifts may opt for less-expensive gadgets such as cell phones, digital music players, video phones or noise-cancelling headphones. \"When you look at this year\\'s potpourri of available items, there are some items that aren\\'t that expensive,\" Kay said. \"PCs these days are like gum drops. You can buy them or forego them entirely depending on whether you\\'re feeling hungry.\"',\n",

But in announcing that it has struck a deal with Tom Cruise and his producing partner Paula Wagner to revive UA, MGM said it was harkening back to UA\\'s storied history as a filmmaker-friendly \"place where producers, writers, directors and actors can thrive in a creative environment.\" UA, which has earned nine best picture Oscars, has occupied a unique if sometimes embattled spot in Hollywood history. And its legacy is remembered fondly. With that in mind, producer David Picker, who worked at UA from 1956-73, heading production through most of that period, hailed its newest incarnation, saying: \"Knowing some of the films that Paula and Tom have encouraged, it seems like an enlightened choice. The industry could use a film company that works with filmmakers and can give them a sympathetic ear.\" As legend has it, silent film stars Chaplin, Pickford and Fairbanks first began talking of creating their own company while traveling the country as part of a war bonds tour during World War I. With Griffith joining the start-up, they each committed to making five movies annually, an overly ambitious plan even given the accelerated production schedules of the silent era. The industry joke that immediately made the rounds was that \"the inmates have taken over the asylum.\" In later years it would be attributed to Chaplin himself, though it is reported to have been coined by Richard Rowland, co-founder of Metro Pictures with Louis B. Mayer. UA\\'s first decade saw the release of such movies as Chaplin\\'s \"The Gold Rush,\" \"City Lights\" and \"Modern Times\"; Griffith\\'s \"America\"; Fairbanks\\' \"The Three Musketeers\" and \"Robin Hood\"; and 1929\\'s \"Coquette,\" which earned Pickford the best actress Oscar. With Joseph Schenck -- who later would co-found 20th Century Pictures -- serving as president, UA also ventured into distribution and exhibition and worked with filmmakers ranging from Samuel Goldwyn to Walt Disney. Griffith quickly abandoned the venture. With the coming of talkies, Pickford and Fairbanks faded from the screen, and Chaplin scaled back his own efforts. In its initial burst of success and gradual demise, UA foreshadowed such other filmmaker-driven companies as First Artists (a partnership among Sidney Poitier, Barbra Streisand, Paul Newman and Steve McQueen in the late \\'60s) and the Directors Company (formed by Peter Bogdanovich, Francis Ford Coppola and William Friedkin in the early \\'70s). In each case, the founding partners\\' individual agendas simply didn\\'t stay in sync for long. UA had become a shell of its former self when, in 1951, New York-based entertainment attorneys Arthur Krim and Robert Benjamin proposed that they take over the company in exchange for an option to buy it if they could turn a profit within four years. Under their leadership, UA adopted a new model. It didn\\'t invest in developing a studio lot but instead financed movies with filmmakers -- many of who chose to shoot on location throughout the world -- who were given an unprecedented amount of freedom without meddlesome executives looking over their shoulders. The \"new\" UA attracted such filmmakers as producer Sam Spiegel and director John Huston, who turned out \"The African Queen\"; Hill-Hecht-Lancaster Prods., which produced the Oscar-winning \"Marty\"; and producer-director Stanley Kramer (\"Judgment at Nuremberg\"). By the \\'60s, UA seemed to capture the swingin\\' zeitgeist. Working with Walter Mirisch and the Mirisch Corp., it turned out \"West Side Story\" and \"In the Heat of the Night\" as well as Billy Wilder\\'s \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"The Apartment.\" It was tuned into the British new wave, as well, handling the Beatles\\' \"A Hard Day\\'s Night,\" Tony Richardson\\'s \"Tom Jones\" and John Schlesinger\\'s \"Midnight Cowboy\" and \"Sunday Bloody Sunday.\" It discovered and nurtured such enormously popular franchises as the James Bond adventures, the Pink Panther series and the \"Rocky\" movies. \"Let\\'s face it, it was a simpler time. We were in the movie business, not the marketing business,\" Picker recalled. \"The atmosphere that we created was one of creative freedom within the parameters of the budget. Although there were risks, the numbers were a lot smaller then. Still, it was a unique time in the industry. At UA, we abrogated our power and egos in favor of the filmmakers and the relations we developed with them.\" In 1967, Krim and Benjamin sold control of UA to San Francisco-based Transamerica Corp., an insurance and financial services company. For a time, all prospered. In the mid-\\'70s, UA scored an Oscar trifecta, winning three best pictures in a row for \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest,\" \"Rocky\" and \"Annie Hall.\" Eventually tiring of corporate oversight, however, Krim and Benjamin and their team exited in 1978 to form Orion Pictures. Gradually, UA\\'s fate had become intertwined with MGM\\'s. It had taken over sales and distribution for MGM\\'s films in 1973, and after a new management team allowed Michael Cimino\\'s \"Heaven\\'s Gate\" to escalate into a $40 million box office bomb, Transamerica tired of the movie business and sold the company to Kirk Kerkorian, who merged it with MGM. In recent years, UA has had something of an identity crisis. While briefly under the leadership of respected indie exec Bingham Ray, it entered the specialty films arena with such films as Michael Moore\\'s \"Bowling for Columbine\" and Terry George\\'s \"Hotel Rwanda.\" At the same time, it appeared to be steering toward more popular genre fare with the \"Legally Blonde\" and \"Jeepers Creepers\" franchises. After MGM was sold to a consortium of investors in April 2005, UA was effectively put on the shelf. UA films produced before the sale, such as \"Capote\" and \"Art School Confidential,\" were released by Sony Pictures Classics. A reminder of past glories, the UA logo also adorns the upcoming Sony Pictures release \"Casino Royale,\" which MGM co-produced with Columbia Pictures. It now falls to Cruise and Wagner to see whether they can restore the UA name to its past glory by taking it back to the future. Reuters/Hollywood Reporter',\n",
       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Two months after his bitter break with Paramount Pictures, superstar Tom Cruise has teamed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. to revive United Artists, the fabled but moribund studio founded by four of the biggest names in early Hollywood, MGM said on Thursday. \\n\\n Under his new partnership with MGM, Cruise will produce at least four films a year for United Artists with his longtime business partner, Paula Wagner, who will oversee day-to-day operations of UA as its chief executive officer. The pair also received an unspecified ownership stake in UA, an historically freewheeling enterprise that was long known as \"the company built by the stars\" but had grown virtually dormant since its MGM parent changed hands in 2005. The deal also gives a new creative platform for Cruise, 44, a once invulnerable star whose Hollywood clout was widely seen as diminished by the abrupt end to his 14-year production deal with Viacom Inc.-owned Paramount in August. In an unusually blunt and highly public parting shot at Cruise, Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone said the actor\\'s \"recent conduct has not been acceptable to Paramount.\" He was referring to a string of publicity faux pas by Cruise ranging from his manic, couch-hopping profession of love for actress Katie Holmes last year on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" to his strident denunciations of psychiatry in defense of his belief in the Church of Scientology. \\'THE BIGGEST STAR IN THE WORLD\\' The agreement with MGM allows Cruise, whose latest Paramount film, \"Mission: Impossible III,\" grossed more than $390 million worldwide, to star in pictures for UA while remaining available to appear in movies for other studios. \"We were looking for a strategic partner (for UA) and we\\'ve found a strategic partner and it just so happens that he\\'s the biggest star in the world,\" MGM spokesman Jeff Pryor told Reuters. Under their new deal, Cruise and Wagner will now exercise control over UA\\'s movie slate -- about four films a year to start -- from initial development to giving the go-ahead to new productions, MGM said in a statement announcing the deal. But that ability to \"greenlight\" production will be \"subject to certain parameters,\" MGM said. The new UA will remain located at the MGM studios in Los Angeles. As reconstituted, UA will function as a supplier of feature films to MGM, with the parent studio and its equity partners fully financing production and development of those films. Privately held MGM also will handle worldwide marketing and distribution for UA films. \"The talent friendly studio will be reborn as a place where producers, writers, directors and actors can thrive in a creative environment,\" MGM said in the statement. United Artists was founded in 1919 by screen legends Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks and pioneering director D.W. Griffith -- the four biggest names in motion pictures at the time. Their goal was to give artists more creative control and profits. Formation of the studio elicited the famed remark from Richard A. Rowland, then president of Metro Pictures: \"So the lunatics have taken charge of the asylum.\" After going public decades later and being acquired by financial services company Transamerica, UA secured distribution rights to films released by MGM in 1973 and was purchased outright by MGM eight years later. Long controlled by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, MGM was acquired in April 2005 by a consortium of private equity firms and media companies, including Comcast Corp. and Sony Corp.. The deal with Cruise was announced by MGM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Harry Sloan, who has since led an effort to revitalize the studio after taking over last October and is now turning his attention to rejuvenating United Artists. UA\\'s film library contains more than 1,200 titles, including such classics as \"Midnight Cowboy,\" \"Some Like It Hot,\" \"Annie Hall\" and the \"Rocky\" and \"Pink Panther\" movies. It also includes \"Rain Man,\" which co-starred Cruise and earned four Academy Awards, including the Oscar for best picture in 1988. Reuters/VNU',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a 5-1/2 year low in October and hiring in the two prior months was revised up, the government said on Friday, leading financial markets to slash bets on interest-rate cuts. \\n\\n The rosier-than-expected job picture, days before next Tuesday\\'s congressional elections in which ruling Republicans are considered at risk of losing control, caused rejoicing among President George W. Bush\\'s party but Democrats countered that most Americans still say household budgets are under pressure. The Labor Department said 92,000 jobs were added in October. But it said hiring in each of September and August was far more vigorous than first thought, implying enough economic vigor to keep growing despite a housing-industry slowdown. September\\'s job-creation total was revised up to 148,000, nearly three times the 51,000 reported a month ago, and there were 230,000 new jobs in August instead of 188,000. The unemployment rate fell in October to 4.4 percent from 4.6 percent in September. It was the lowest jobless rate since 4.3 percent in May 2001. Bond prices sank on fears it erased any chances of interest-rate reductions in the near future. The price of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 30/32 for a yield of 4.72 percent, compared with 4.60 percent late on Thursday. Stocks also fell, partly on fears the Fed might need to raise rates to keep inflation risks in check if it the labor market becomes too tight. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI> fell 32.50 points to close at 11,986.04. SERVICES EXPANDING At midmorning, the Institute for Supply Management reported growth in the service sector, the nation\\'s biggest source of employment, was strong in October. Service businesses like banks, restaurants and hotels account for 80 percent of total U.S. business activity. The private-sector group said its monthly services index climbed to 57.1 last month from 52.9 in September. Any measure over 50 signals the sector is expanding. On a campaign swing in Springfield, Missouri, Bush cited the jobs figures as a reason to vote Republican in elections for the U.S. House of Representatives and for one-third of the Senate on Tuesday. \"Tax cuts have led to a strong and growing economy, and this morning we got more proof of that,\" Bush said. But Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, said \"staying the course on the President\\'s policies has failed\" to relieve average Americans\\' strained finances. Analysts said the jobs data adds to confusion about the economy\\'s direction, since it comes just a week after the government reported the weakest expansion in more than three years in the third quarter. Gross domestic product slowed to a 1.6 percent annual rate of growth from 2.6 percent in the second quarter. EARNINGS UP Notwithstanding softer overall growth, the Labor Department said average hourly earnings in October rose 0.4 percent to $16.91 -- higher than the 0.3 percent that analysts had anticipated -- while the average workweek edged up to 33.9 hours from 33.8. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 3.9 percent, the department said. The combination of slower growth and rising wages has to be unsettling for economic policy-makers, analysts said. \"The Fed would have liked the unemployment rate to jump 0.2 percentage point and payrolls to have been revised downward,\" said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. \"They got the worst of all worlds and any thoughts of a near-term rate cut should be out the window.\" Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany, New York, said the report underlined a tightening labor market that could mean future rate hikes instead of reductions. \"There\\'s tightness showing up in the decline in the unemployment rate and in the upward pressure on wages, which were stronger than expected,\" Johnson said. \"This will certainly give hawks on the Federal Open Market Committee some ammunition.\" The payroll report is calculated from two separate surveys of households and businesses. The household survey showed that a whopping 437,000 more people were employed in October. The business survey showed most of the new hiring in October was in service industries, where 152,000 new jobs were created, while goods-producing industries shed 60,000 jobs.',\n",

( HAL.N ) said it will likely agree to regulators\\' request for more time to investigate allegations that the world\\'s No. 2 oilfield services group was involved in a scheme that paid bribes to Nigerian officials. \\n\\n The company said in its quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday that the SEC requested a so-called \"tolling agreement\" for its formal investigation. Such an agreement puts off the time when a statute of limitations goes into effect for an investigation. The regulators, as well as the U.S. Justice Department and Britain\\'s Serious Fraud Office, are looking at whether a consortium, in which Halliburton\\'s KBR unit had a 25 percent stake, made payments to secure construction work for a multibillion-dollar natural gas liquefaction complex in Nigeria. In 2004 Halliburton cut ties to Jack Stanley, former KBR chairman, over the alleged $180 million bribery scheme. Halliburton has said it has reason to believe that starting at least 10 years ago, members of the consortium planned payments to Nigerian officials. If the SEC and DOJ find the payments violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Halliburton said it may face a suspension or debarment of its ability to contract with U.S. and foreign government agencies. During 2005, KBR and its affiliates had revenue of $6.6 billion from its government contracts work with the United States or state or local governments. Earlier this week, KBR set the terms of its planned initial public offering, which could raise up to $473 million.',\n",

Amex has a 0.4 percent stake in ICBC, which went public last month, raising up to $21.9 billion for China\\'s biggest bank in the world\\'s largest initial public offering. ICBC Vice-Chairman Yang Kaisheng said: \"The ICBC-American Express partnership contributes to the development of the card industry in China and offers more choices to the market by expanding into the corporate sector.\" ICBC was the country\\'s largest card issuing lender, having put more than 180 million bank cards into the market, Yang told a news conference. Over 10 million of those were credit cards rather than debit cards. The bank, which has 18,000 branches across China, had introduced best practices in terms of risk controls. Yang said that ICBC had encountered few defaults in its credit card business. The two firms already offer the ICBC American Express Card and the ICBC China Petrol American Express Card, which were launched in 2004 and 2006, respectively. They said the dual-currency card, targeting large local firms and multinationals in China, would help them to manage and reduce corporate travel and entertainment spending. Amex said its recent research showed Chinese businesses spent $7.4 billion a year on travel. \"There is no better time than now to launch the corporate card in China,\" Crittenden told the news conference. \"The growth of Chinese economy has contributed to a surge in business travel that includes business entertainment spending.\"',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) plans to stop contributing to its main U.S. pension plan beginning in 2008 and will instead bolster plans that employees contribute to, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters. \\n\\n Many traditional manufacturing companies have been freezing their pension plans to cut costs, but Citigroup\\'s move will increase the company\\'s compensation costs, to the chagrin of some investors. \"Citigroup has been making a lot of investments that are supposed to pay off in two or three years, but investors would like to see some cost cuts that will bring results quicker than that. I don\\'t see how this helps,\" said Lee Norton, an analyst at JS Asset Management, which owns Citigroup shares. Citigroup said in a memo that in addition to bringing its retirement plans in line with the rest of the industry, employees had requested the changes, which simplify their retirement plans. Citigroup at the end of 2005 had 140,000 full-time and 8,000 part-time employees in the United States and 159,000 full-time employees outside the U.S. It has about $10 billion of pension assets. The company had previously allowed most of its U.S. employees to be in both a cash balance pension plan and a defined contribution plan. A cash balance plan does not promise an employee a pre-defined payout. Instead, the employer makes an annual contribution to the plan. When the employee retires, he or she can receive the funds as a lump-sum payout, or use the funds to buy an annuity. Employees that leave the company can take with them the funds that had been contributed. In contrast, employees in a defined contribution plan, known in the U.S. as a 401(k) plan, can choose their investments. Employers typically match some percentage of an employee\\'s contribution. Citigroup will match up to 6 percent of an employee\\'s contribution, and make a fixed contribution of 2 percent to employees whose total compensation is $100,000 or less. A small percentage of Citigroup employees are in a legacy pension plan that will not be frozen. Three years into the reign of Chuck Prince, Citigroup is under big pressure to boost its profit growth and rein in costs. In the first nine months of 2006, Citigroup\\'s revenue rose 5 percent, while operating expenses rose 13 percent. That performance is weighing on the company\\'s shares, which have risen just 2.2 percent this year, while the KBW Bank index .BKX has risen 8.1 percent.',\n",
       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany\\'s Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ) delivered a better-than-expected third-quarter net profit as strong lending to smaller firms made up for a hefty one-off charge at its real estate unit and said it may be heading for its best ever full-year result. \\n\\n \"In nine months we have already earned more than in the whole of 2005,\" Chief Financial Officer Eric Strutz told analysts in a conference call on Friday. \"2006 will be one of the best years in the history of Commerzbank and maybe even the best.\" Analysts cautiously welcomed the 217 million euro ($277.2 million) profit which was seen as an improvement on a disappointing second quarter and the bank\\'s shares jumped 5.1 percent to 29.23 euros by 1119 GMT. Strutz said buoyancy in financial markets made Commerzbank look to the rest of the year with confidence. Its net return on equity of 14.5 percent in the first nine months was still short of its long-term goal of 15 percent which it wants to reach by 2010, but up from 12.1 percent a year ago. A Reuters poll of analysts had given an average net profit forecast of 210 million euros for the third quarter, down from 262 million euros a year earlier. \"At first glance I am not overly enthusiastic but at least the quality of the results is better. For the first time this year, it is not about trading -- interest income and commission income is strong,\" said Sigrid Baas, an analyst with ING. Commerzbank has a wide range of interests including retail banking, corporate lending to small and medium sized firms known as Mittelstand, asset management, mortgage lending and a treasury and public finance business. \"They have met expectations fully. Mittelstand was a bit better. Corporates and markets was a positive plus while public finance and treasury was a disappointment,\" said Andreas Weese, an analyst at HVB. STRONG LENDING The key Mittelstand business saw operating profit jump to 225 million euros from 165 million a year earlier. \"German industry has recovered tremendously in the last 18 months,\" CFO Strutz said, adding that he expected loan loss provisions in the division to total 170 million euro for the full year but to fall by about 10 million euro in 2007. The bank made overall risk provisions of 415 million euros, up from 151 million euros in the third quarter of 2005, boosted by a one-off 293 million charge from the absorption of the Eurohypo real estate and mortgage business it bought last year. Strutz said Eurohypo, which has fallen short of investor expectations since Commerzbank bought it for 4.5 billion euros last year, was unlikely to achieve its planned 15 percent pretax profit increase this year. Commerzbank has said it sees group risk provisions falling steadily to less than 900 million euro in 2007 and 700 million in 2008. Risk provisions in the first nine months were nearly 800 million euros. The bank also reported trading profit weakened to 183 million euros from 212 million a year ago while commission income jumped to 703 million from 599 million a year earlier. Trading results at Commerzbank\\'s public finance divisions were hit by adverse market conditions. \"We had an impact on the trading result from public finance and treasury which was hit by a flattening of the yield curve,\" said Strutz. Commerzbank\\'s shares plunged in August when investors were upset by second quarter results showing a higher-than-expected tax bill and a weak performance in the bank\\'s key business of lending to small and medium-sized firms. \"The fact that the interest income is what\\'s pushing the performance and not trading will be seen positively,\" said Andrew Webborn, an analyst with Societe Generale. \"I think there is a sustainable improvement.\" The bank\\'s shares have been sluggish this year, falling behind their rivals as investors grew increasingly nervous about the earnings power of Eurohypom, and have underperformed European rivals .SX7P by more than half.

Analysts were expecting $5.61 a share on average, according to Reuters Estimates. \"2007 will be a more challenging year than we\\'ve had in the last couple because we\\'re going to hit turbulent waters,\" Caterpillar Chief Executive Jim Owens said at the meeting. \"These are big corrections\" in on-highway engines and residential construction, he added, noting that they will represent areas of \"acute weakness\" for the U.S. economy. Combined, Caterpillar\\'s on-highway diesel engine and construction equipment businesses account for roughly $5 billion in annual sales; they will be off 35 percent to 40 percent next year, Owens said. Down the road, Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar\\'s outlook was more positive. The company set a sales growth target of up to 46 percent by 2010 and forecast improvement across most of its regions worldwide. Caterpillar and other old line manufacturers have been dogged by the slowing U.S. economy. Higher raw material and energy costs have dampened demand in many markets, including housing. Shares of the maker of heavy earth-moving machinery were little changed on Friday, last off 6 cents at $60.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten, who was present at the meeting, said that \"2007 is clearly a year of transition.\" The company said it still sees 2007 sales flat to up about 5 percent, in a range of $41 billion to $43 billion. That compares with analysts\\' expectations for $40.38 billion and the company\\'s expected 2006 sales of $41 billion. Caterpillar backed its forecast for a 2006 profit in the range of $5.05 to $5.30 a share. ROSIER LONG-TERM VIEW Company executives said they see \"plausible\" sales in 2010 of $45 billion to $60 billion, assuming a compound annual growth rate of 6 percent beginning in 2008. The company also has a goal for 2010 earnings of $8.13 to $10.05 a share, assuming a 15 percent to 20 percent compound annual growth rate through that year. Caterpillar said it sees global gross domestic product growth next year of 3.5 percent. For the 2006 to 2010 period, it expects global GDP to be up 3.4 percent, compared with 2.8 percent growth from 2000 to 2005. In that same four-year period, Caterpillar sees GDP growth expanding in the North America, Europe, Latin America and Japan regions, compared with the period ending in 2005. However, it sees growth slowing slightly in Asia Pacific, excluding Japan. Next year, Owens said Caterpillar expects industry sales to U.S. residential home builders to \"fall more than 30 percent.\" The head of Caterpillar\\'s engine business, Douglas Oberhelman, told analysts he sees demand for the company\\'s diesel engines next year stalling in most sectors. He said industrywide growth is slowing in the oil, maritime and industrial sectors. It is unchanged in electric power and is falling in the North American heavy-duty and medium-duty on-highway markets. Oberhelman said there will be layoffs at the company\\'s Mossville, Illinois, plant when on-highway engine demand drops next year, with sales down more dramatically in the first half. He did not quantify the job cuts. \"There are too many uncertainties in \\'07 to bank on results like \\'06,\" he said.',\n",

( RDEN.O ) posted a quarterly loss on Friday as it spent money to restructure its European operations and launch new perfumes, but the results were stronger than expected as it spent less on marketing than it had planned. \\n\\n Despite strong sales growth and the smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, the company maintained its financial forecasts as it works on integrating brands it recently acquired at the same time that it prepares for the crucial holiday season. Chairman and Chief Executive E. Scott Beattie admitted during a conference call that the company is probably being somewhat conservative by not raising its forecast, and said it could revise the view in the second half of the fiscal year. Elizabeth Arden initially gave its fiscal year forecast in August, leading analysts to lower their expectations. The cosmetics and fragrance maker also said that its board authorized the repurchase of an additional $40 million of common stock. Shares of Elizabeth Arden, which said it feels good about the current retail environment, were up 3.2 percent at $17.57 after rising to $17.73 in morning Nasdaq trading. Elizabeth Arden posted a loss of $1.3 million, or 5 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, compared with a profit of $895,000, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. The loss was 2 cents per share excluding restructuring charges, blowing past Wall Street\\'s average expectation for a loss of 27 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. \"However, much of the upside appears to stem from a shift in promotional spending,\" CIBC analyst Joseph Altobello wrote in a note. He has a \"sector performer\" rating on the shares. Elizabeth Arden said it moved some $5 million to $6 million of its promotional spending from the first quarter into the current second quarter to reach holiday shoppers. It had to move some marketing for the new With Love ... Hilary Duff perfume into the current quarter due to timing issues with the production of a music video and commercial for the scent named after the teen actress and singer. Sales rose 12.1 percent to $254.8 million, driven by new brands such as With Love ... Hilary Duff, Danielle by Danielle Steel and fragrances it bought this summer. The sales fell short of analysts\\' average forecast of $258.8 million. New York-based Elizabeth Arden added designer fragrances such as Badgley Mischka to its lineup with the acquisition of the brand licenses and some assets of privately held Riviera Concepts Inc.

Elizabeth Arden said its new $95 Prevage eye treatment has been very successful. The product, which has been at U.S. and Canadian makeup counters for about two weeks, is also driving sales of the original $150 Prevage anti-aging face treatment. The company still expects to earn $1.10 per share to $1.20 per share this year, excluding any restructuring charges. Analysts, on average, expect a profit of $1.10 per share. Elizabeth Arden said it still expects fiscal 2007 sales to rise by about 15 percent to 18 percent to $1.10 billion to $1.13 billion.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil rose above $59 a barrel on Friday after the United States warned that a militant group may soon attack Nigeria\\'s oil facilities. \\n\\n Adding to concerns, BP ( BP.L ) said it received a bomb threat at its refinery in Whiting, Indiana, the fifth-largest refinery in the United states. \"The news of the bomb threat combined with earlier concern on Nigerian output,\" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates. U.S. light crude CLc1 settled $1.26 higher at $59.14 a barrel, after falling 83 cents on Thursday. London Brent crude LCOc1 gained $1.28 to $59.15 a barrel. The U.S. consulate in the Nigerian city of Lagos said in a release Friday that a militant Niger Delta group may have finalized plans for a concerted attack against oil facilities in the Niger Delta region. \"The attacks allegedly will be carried out sometime during the first week of November and will include 10 to 20 simultaneous bombings of land-based targets and a series of separate attacks on oil installations in which expatriate workers will be taken hostage,\" according to the statement. Militant attacks have cut output by about 500,000 barrels per day since February from the world\\'s eighth-largest exporter, but many threats are not carried out. The U.S. consulate said on October 4 that militants may target the major oil and gas export hub of Bonny Island, but to date no attack has materialized. Oil is down about $20 from its mid-July peak of $78.40 and is hovering near the bottom of a range of $57-$62 that has held since early October. AMPLE SUPPLIES Ample U.S. fuel stocks and doubt over OPEC\\'s resolve in cutting supply are keeping prices under pressure. Stocks of crude, distillates and gasoline are still above last year\\'s levels as the world\\'s largest energy consumer heads into peak winter demand. \"Without cold weather, energy demand is likely to be lower and so crude oil, and later refined product, inventories are likely to remain comfortable,\" said Tobin Gorey of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Traders are waiting to see if OPEC producers will adhere to an agreement to cut by 1.2 million bpd starting from November. Consultancy Oil Movements sees OPEC exports down only 440,000 bpd in the four weeks to November 18. \"The market remains skeptical that any more than half of the pledged cut will occur, leaving room for the market to be surprised either way,\" said Gorey. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have told their customers they will get less crude this month, but most other producers have yet to commit. Trade sources said on Thursday Algeria had cut November oil supply in line with its pledge. Supply from non-OPEC producer Russia also fell for the second month in a row in October, to 9.71 million bpd, government data showed on Thursday.

Consumer-oriented stocks such as McDonald\\'s Corp. ( MCD.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) slipped. Labor Department data showed the U.S. unemployment rate fell to its lowest in more than five years. While the economy added fewer jobs in October than economists had expected, August and September payrolls were revised significantly higher. A jump in oil prices contributed to negative sentiment. \"Some investors were hanging on the idea that the Fed would cut rates soon, which would give an extra boost to stocks. But that possibility no longer seems to be sustainable,\" said Michael Metz, chief investment officer of Oppenheimer & Co. in New York.

U.S. crude oil for December delivery CLZ6 rose $1.26 to settle at $59.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the U.S. consulate in Lagos warned a militant group in Nigeria may have imminent plans to launch attacks on oil facilities. The rise in crude prices helped some energy stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) A Dow component, Exxon Mobil rose 1.4 percent, or 96 cents, to $72.15 on the New York Stock Exchange. The biggest drag on the Dow was McDonald\\'s, down 1.9 percent, or 81 cents, to $41.24 on the NYSE. The fast-food restaurant chain\\'s customers include senior citizens and others on fixed incomes, who are particularly sensitive to rising energy costs and interest rates. Shares of Wal-Mart, the world\\'s biggest retailer, fell after it lowered prices on nearly 100 key electronics items such as plasma televisions for the holiday season. For details, see <ID:nN03295629>. The stock dropped 1.6 percent, or 76 cents, to $47.53, marking its worst weekly percentage loss in more than four years. Wal-Mart was the second-heaviest weight on the Dow and also ranked among the S&P 500\\'s biggest losers. Wal-Mart\\'s move to slash prices pressured stocks of specialty electronic chains Best Buy Co.

       "  ' SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Once bitter rivals, Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) and Novell Inc. NOVL.O entered into an agreement on Thursday to allow open-source Linux software to work with Windows. \\n\\n After years of trying to crush open-source rivals, Microsoft said it will provide support and technology to allow Linux to work on Windows. At the same time, it agreed not to assert patent claims against customers of Suse Linux, Novell\\'s operating system. In its second major partnership with an open-source software company this week, Microsoft sought to assure a growing number of Linux users, especially in the computer server market, that the two platforms can co-exist. \"We appreciate that open-source software plays an important role in our industry and it\\'s here to stay,\" said Brad Smith, Microsoft\\'s general counsel. \"This will enable a new level of cooperation between open source and proprietary software.\" Unlike proprietary software, open-source software lets developers share code and add functions. Users pay for custom features, maintenance and technical support. Linux is the most popular variant of open-source software. The Microsoft partnership provides a boost to Novell, a distant second to open-source rivals and Linux leader Red Hat Inc. RHAT.O, since corporate customers increasingly run both Windows and Linux machines. The agreement comes two days after Microsoft struck a long-term partnership with open-source software maker Zend. News of the Novell partnership sent Novell\\'s shares up 16 percent while pushing Red Hat stock down 2 percent. Microsoft shares were mostly unchanged. \"Linux has grown up,\" said Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. who covers Red Hat and Novell. \"This is a mainstream technology that major technology vendors are struggling to find a way to support.\" Microsoft is not the only software giant eyeing Linux. Last week Oracle Corp. ORCL.O made its boldest move yet into Linux software, offering cut-price technical support in a surprise bid to wrest away Red Hat customers. Microsoft and Novell said their pact, which will run until at least 2012, is a broad set of business and technological agreements to make their products work better together. They will pay each other up front for a release from any potential liability for use of each others\\' patented intellectual property. Since Microsoft sells more products, it will pay a larger sum. Novell will also make royalty payments to Microsoft based on a percentage of its revenue from open-source products. Neither company disclosed any financial figures. The agreement focuses on three main technological areas: virtualization to allow Linux to run on Windows machines and vice versa, management services to help customers work with a mix of Linux and Windows products, and document format compatibility to allow users to more easily share documents. \"This announcement gives our customers interoperability and peace of mind, all in one,\" Novell Chief Executive Ron Hovsepian said at a news conference in San Francisco. Although Linux has made little progress in unseating the Windows operating system from PC desktops, it has continued to gain market share in recent years. According to industry data from Gartner, 21 percent of worldwide server shipments in 2005 run Linux versus 67 percent of servers running Windows. More than a decade ago, Novell assembled the pieces of a full-scale Microsoft competitor by buying database software from Borland and WordPerfect, an alternative to Microsoft Word. It bought rights to a rival to Microsoft\\'s Disk Operating System (DOS) and a version of Unix, a predecessor to Linux, seeking to fuse them with Novell\\'s own operating system. But the strategy failed amid surging demand for Windows, leading Novell to file an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. Two years ago, Microsoft paid $536 million to Novell to settle part of those claims. Shares of Novell rose 15.7 percent, or 92 cents, to $6.79, while Red Hat shares fell 2 percent, or 33 cents, to $16.10 in regular Nasdaq trade. Microsoft shares fell 4 cents to $26.77.

       "  \" CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on Friday said it lowered prices on nearly 100 electronics including plasma televisions, digital cameras and mobile phones, getting a jump on the holiday-season price wars. \\n\\n The world's biggest retailer has vowed to aggressively cut prices this holiday season as it tries to lift anemic sales at its U.S. stores. In October, it cut prices on a selection of toys and games, which it said boosted sales volume. The latest markdowns include a $500 cut on a Panasonic 42-inch plasma television to $1,294. Rival Best Buy Co. Inc. offered a similar Panasonic 42-inch plasma television for $1,708.99 on its Web site. Best Buy's stock was off more than 2 percent at $51.88 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after trading as high as $53.71 earlier in the session. Rival Circuit City City Stores Inc. was down 1.4 percent at $25.75 on the NYSE, after hitting $26.48 earlier in the day. Both stocks fell sharply after Wal-Mart's announcement. Analysts contend that specialty chains can fend off Wal-Mart by offering better in-store service as well as in-home installation for sophisticated electronics. Wal-Mart posted disappointing October sales and forecast flat November sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, in part because of poor demand for trendy apparel and disruption from store remodeling efforts. Chief Executive Officer Lee Scott told analysts last week that he was not satisfied with Wal-Mart's poor sales growth, but expected demand to improve during the holiday season. Wal-Mart's stock was down 93 cents, or 1.9 percent, at $47.36 on the NYSE.\",\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O shares posted their biggest percentage drop ever on Friday, a day after the No. 1 natural and organic grocer said it was pressured by traditional grocers adopting the fresh produce and prepared meals that are a cornerstone of its strategy. \\n\\n On Thursday, Whole Foods said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to rise 6 percent to 8 percent in 2007, far below the double-digit increases the retailer has posted for the last three years. Same-store sales rose just 6.8 percent in the first five weeks of the fiscal year that started in late September -- that is half the growth posted in the same period a year ago. Whole Foods also said total sales should rise 13 percent to 17 percent in the current fiscal year. It previously called for 15 percent to 20 percent growth. HSBC, which has an \"underweight\" rating on Whole Foods, slashed its price target on the shares to $33 from $58 and Bank of America downgraded the shares to \"neutral\" from \"buy.\" \"Competition is tougher. No question about it,\" Chief Executive John Mackey said on a conference call on Thursday. Whole Foods fell as much as 24.2 percent to $45.56 before recovering slightly to $46.21 in Friday afternoon trading. It was the most heavily traded company on the Nasdaq. It was the largest percentage drop since Austin-based Whole Foods went public in January 1992 and pushed the shares to their lowest level since February 2005, adjusting for a stock split. Shares of grocery distributor United Natural Foods Inc. ( UNFI.O ), which counts Whole Foods as its biggest customer, was off 3.8 percent to $33.01. Whole Foods rival Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O fell 6.1 percent to $15.90. PRESSURE, HEADHUNTERS Whole Foods said it is feeling pressure from niche retailers, such as privately-held Trader Joe\\'s and Wegmans, which are known for good customer service and prepared foods. At the same time, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and traditional grocers such as Safeway Inc. ( SWY.N ) have added more organic fare. \"From copying many aspects in the design of our stores to selling more organic foods of all types, other supermarkets are studying and emulating us in dozens of different ways in their attempt to compete more aggressively against us,\" Mackey said in a letter posted on his blog. Several Whole Foods executives have been approached by headhunters, leading the company to raise its salary cap to keep them from jumping to rival companies. \"Raising the salary cap to 19 times the average pay has become necessary to help ensure the retention of our key leadership,\" Mackey wrote. He cut his own salary to $1. HSBC analyst Mark Husson said he did not see why Whole Foods should trade at a premium to quality long-term growth retailers. \"Super high premiums for concept stocks are only sustainable, we believe, while they are still \\'working\\' or delivering vastly superior returns,\" Husson wrote in a note to clients. \"When reality catches up and growth slows, the entire discounted future tends to collapse in -- and so do the multiples.\" As of Thursday, Whole Foods shares traded at about 36.4 times next year\\'s expected profit -- a sharp premium to No. 1 grocer Kroger Co. ( KR.N ), which trades at just 14 times expected earnings, and No. 1 drugstore Walgreen, which trades at 18.5 times its expected profit.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin said on Friday progress had slowed on reaching a compromise to approve AT&T Inc.\\'s ( T.N ) $81.3 billion acquisition of BellSouth Corp. BLS.N after a vote was postponed for the third time. \\n\\n \"We have made progress,\" Martin told reporters after the FCC\\'s public meeting. \"I always try to work with my colleagues, but I think we\\'re still pretty far apart and I think the progress has slowed.\" But he also left open the door to getting a ruling from the FCC\\'s general counsel that would allow Republican Commissioner Robert McDowell to vote on the transaction. So far McDowell has sat out because he had previously worked for a group that represents AT&T and BellSouth competitors. \"I\\'ve been focused up until now, up until today, on just trying to make sure that we work through all the different alternatives that any of the commissioners have proposed,\" Martin said. \"We\\'re going to continue to end up doing that; but we do have to take a step back and try to figure where we should end up going from here,\" Martin said. McDowell quickly left the FCC meeting after it ended without taking questions. Commissioners often linger to chat with staff, industry representatives and reporters. On Thursday, Martin delayed a vote scheduled for Friday after he and fellow Republican Commissioner Deborah Taylor Tate were unable to reach a deal on possible conditions with the two Democrat commissioners, Jonathan Adelstein and Michael Copps. The four have been haggling over a host of conditions that could be attached to their approval. They include terms for high-speed Internet service and wholesale rates for rivals to lease access to AT&T\\'s network. Competitors have pressed for more conditions than AT&T initially said it could accept, including that the company sell some wireless airwaves that BellSouth owns; and some Internet content providers have demanded that the FCC bar AT&T from charging them more for priority service to customers. The acquisition of BellSouth, the No. 3 U.S. local telephone carrier, would solidify AT&T\\'s position as the largest U.S. telecommunications provider and bring their Cingular Wireless joint venture under one roof. The FCC approval, which analysts expect ultimately to happen, is the last regulatory hurdle for the deal. The head of Comptel -- which represents competitors of AT&T and BellSouth and was McDowell\\'s previous employer -- said should the FCC be unable to reach consensus, an administrative law judge rule should rule on whether the deal would be in the public interest. \"Clearly, the commission, at least for the moment, is having difficulty ascertaining what the public interest benefits are and what the appropriate conditions would be,\" Earl Comstock, Comptel\\'s chief executive officer, told Reuters. AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris said that was not a credible solution. \"We agree with Chairman Martin\\'s assessment,\" he said. As for McDowell, he might find it hard to avoid voting if cleared to do so. McDowell said during his Senate confirmation hearing that he would rely on the FCC counsel\\'s advice and opinions when potential conflict of interest issues emerged. \"We suspect Chairman Martin would still prefer a bipartisan deal, given the expected delay, controversy, and uncertainties involved in activating that commissioner,\" Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. analysts said in a note to clients. AT&T\\'s shares were down 39 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $33.63 on the New York Stock Exchange in late afternoon trading while BellSouth shares fell 61 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $44.04.',\n",

( FDX.N ) said on Friday it will increase rates for express delivery unit FedEx Express by 3.5 percent, effective January 1, 2007. \\n\\n FedEx shares rose more than 1 percent in early trade. The Memphis, Tennessee-based package delivery company said it will raise its standard list rate by 5.5 percent, but the effect of the increase will be offset by a 2 percentage point reduction in its fuel surcharge. FedEx introduced an identical rate increase a year ago for calendar year 2006. \"FedEx\\'s 3.5 percent effective list rate increase at its flagship Express division is a good sign that domestic parcel pricing remains firm and rational,\" Morgan Stanley analyst William Greene wrote in a research note. Morgan Stanley has an \"overweight\" rating on FedEx with a target price of $135. Greene added that FedEx\\'s move indicates that the company expects its main rival, Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ), will follow suit a similar price increase. The company said its fuel surcharge will also be levied on some transportation-based surcharges such as its residential and delivery area charge for all domestic shipments, and for U.S. export and import express shipments paid for by U.S. customers. Most transportation companies in the United States have passed on higher fuel prices to their customers through surcharges. FedEx said it will also introduce rate increases for its ground package delivery unit in 2007 and will announce those changes later this year.

( DUK.N ), which is in the process of spinning off its natural gas division, on Friday posted a lower-than-expected profit and cut its 2007 earnings targets for the two businesses. \\n\\n Chief Financial Officer David Hauser told Reuters results were hit by lower natural gas prices in the U.S. Northeast, unexpected plant outages and higher operating expenses. The news weighed on Duke shares Friday, but Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Hugh Wynne noted Duke \"had a very difficult quarter compared to last year because everything was going superbly well\" in 2005. The company cut its 2007 earnings targets from its previous forecast of $2 per share for the two stand-alone companies, citing the sales of its marketing and trading business and a portion of its real estate unit. \"We believe that the trade-off of lower earnings in \\'07 for a more stable and lower-risk company in the future is in our shareholders\\' best interest over the long term,\" Chief Executive James Rogers said on a conference call on Friday, though he would not give a specific forecast. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said net income totaled $763 million, or 60 cents per share, compared with $41 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier when the company took a large charge related to the sale of some of its wholesale power plants. Excluding special items and discontinued operations, ongoing earnings were 48 cents per share, well below the 56-cent profit expected by analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 37.8 percent to $4.2 billion in the quarter, following the completion of its merger with rival utility Cinergy Corp. Rogers told Reuters the company is still on track to complete the spin-off of its natural gas business by January 1, 2007. Executives reiterated the 4 to 6 percent earnings growth expectations for Duke Energy. The natural gas spin-off, which will be called Spectra Energy Corp., is expected to grow 5 to 7 percent. Shares in the company fell 1.6 percent, or 50 cents, to $30.99 on New York Stock Exchange trading on Friday. Since the beginning of the year, Duke Energy shares have gained about 15 percent. The Standard and Poor\\'s utility index .GSPU has risen some 16 percent during the same period.

Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had forecast $1.24 per share. Net income slipped to $458 million, or $1.38 per share, from $462 million, or $1.41 per share.

For 2007, the company said it expects total earnings of $3.05 to $3.45 per share. Southern California Edison, the second-largest utility in California, had third-quarter operating earnings of $239 million, up $20 million from a year earlier, helped by approval of its general rate case by the California Public Utilities Commission and earnings from its Mountainview power plant. Earnings from continuing operations at the Edison Mission Group, which includes the big Homer City coal-fired power plant in Pennsylvania and Midwest Generation, rose to $204 million from $159 million.

Production problems with Airbus's A380 superjumbo have plunged the group into crisis and forced it to re-examine its projects and restructure its business. The A350 XWB, or Extra Wide Body, is a redesigned version of Airbus's slow-selling mid-sized plane and the German co-head of EADS, Thomas Enders, last month was reported as saying he did not rule out abandoning the XWB due to delays of the A380. Le Figaro said the XWB would cost almost 10 billion euros to make and could be launched in 2012. On Saturday, German magazine Der Spiegel said it had obtained a letter from German aerospace industry group BDLI which revealed the German government was considering giving aid to parts' suppliers hit badly by the delays to the A380. The letter said the delays would lead to 24 A380s fewer than originally planned being built in each of the next two years. In the two years after this, the production shortfall is expected to number a further 25 aircraft in total, the magazine said. The German government has pledged to keep German-French parity in EADS and Chancellor Angela Merkel met Enders and his French counterpart Louis Gallois on Friday, although this failed to produce a plan to secure new German investors in EADS. Germany is concerned that founding EADS shareholder DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE could reduce its stake in the Airbus parent, diminishing German influence in the company just as it is about to push through substantial cost cuts.\",\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Several major U.S. airlines have raised fares in some markets by $5 each way, after two unsuccessful efforts to hike prices in recent weeks. \\n\\n AMR Corp.\\'s American Airlines, Continental Airlines, UAL Corp.\\'s United Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc. each said on Friday that they raised fares in domestic markets not served by low-cost carriers. The increases affect walk-up and advance purchase tickets, according to FareCompare, an airfare tracking company. If the price increase holds, it would mark the first broad fare increase since August when tighter security measures were implemented following a foiled plot to blow up planes. Attempts at broad-based fare increases have failed in recent weeks, with companies rescinding hikes twice in targeted markets after low-cost carriers and some traditional airlines did not match the increases. But unlike recent attempts to increase fares, the latest effort, which affects more markets, is expected to hold because it is not dependent on low-cost carriers playing along. \"Discounters are incapable of acting as spoilers,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a note. \"We ascribe a high probability of success to this increase.\" UAL Corp added that in addition to the $5 hike, the company also has increased fares for last-minute, walk-up purchases by $25 to $50 on Thursday for one-way trips in about 50 markets where the airline faces low-fare competition. Airlines have used fare increases to offset the high price of oil. The latest efforts to raise ticket prices come after jet fuel prices have retreated from historical highs this summer.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks may rise slightly next week as companies wrap up a robust quarterly earnings season, but the U.S. mid-term elections and worries about an economic slowdown could keep many investors wary. \\n\\n Historically, the U.S. mid-term elections have been bullish for the stock market, according to the Stock Trader\\'s Almanac. But politically sensitive stocks could experience some volatility on Tuesday, when U.S. voters go to the polls, and on Wednesday as traders digest election results. \"The biggest variable for stocks this week is the elections,\" said Benjamin Halliburton, managing director of Traditional Capital Management in Summit, New Jersey. Many analysts and insiders of both major U.S. parties have been forecasting that the Republicans may lose control of the House of Representatives and they believe the Senate will be a close contest. Investors are expecting political gridlock, which could be good for stocks. But if Democrats pull in a stronger showing than expected, it could prompt some worries. \"Depending on how the House and Senate go, it can impact sectors differently in the market,\" said Dayle Malone, portfolio manager of Old Second Wealth Management in Chicago. \"There might be a pretty big reaction to a big change in control.\" The Democrats have vowed to take on some controversial reforms, including the repeal of President George W. Bush\\'s reduction in the tax rate on capital gains and dividends, which could make their wins a negative for stocks. \"I think the market is prepared for a split,\" Halliburton said. \"Unless you happen to see both houses of Congress go to one party, one way or the other, we\\'re not expecting a big move.\" Since 1934, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  has gained about 2.9 percent on average during the eight trading days surrounding the election, according to the almanac. STRENGTH IN NUMBERS Next week also marks the beginning of the end of the third-quarter earnings season. Aside from the elections and some economic data later in the week, investors will likely look to some earnings bellwethers, like Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) and Federated Department Stores Inc.FD.N for direction. Strong third-quarter earnings in the last few weeks have helped support the stock market\\'s recent momentum. But stocks have pulled back recently, so more good news on the earnings front could help boost equities. For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 0.9 percent. On Friday, the Dow closed below 12,000 for the first time since mid-October. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  dropped about 1 percent for the week and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  lost 0.8 percent. \"I think the market is still headed higher,\" said Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer of Advisors Capital Management in Paramus, New Jersey. \"This was yet one more quarter in which earnings came in stronger than expected. Analysts keep anticipating a slowdown in earnings and it just hasn\\'t happened.\" More than 80 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly earnings with nearly three-quarters of the firms beating analysts\\' estimates, according to Reuters Estimates. Network equipment maker Cisco, often viewed as a bellwether for technology companies and U.S. capital spending, is expected to post higher earnings on Wednesday for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2007. Results and forecasts from Federated, the parent of Macy\\'s and Bloomingdale\\'s, also will be watched closely so investors can get an indication on the coming holiday shopping season. Federated\\'s results also will be released on Wednesday. \"Once we get past the election, folks start thinking about how the holiday shopping season is going, so some of the retail numbers will become important,\" Malone said. CAUTIOUS CONSUMERS Also coloring investors\\' views of the retail sector will be the University of Michigan\\'s preliminary reading on November consumer sentiment, due on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the University of Michigan\\'s November consumer sentiment index to remain the same as in October, suggesting the recent drop in energy prices has not been enough to motivate consumers to spend more.

The TSE has also been in capital tie-up talks with the New York Stock Exchange NYX.N that could bring together the world's two largest equities markets as early as 2009, the TSE's president said this week. The TSE said it was looking to form alliances with other Asian exchanges, underscoring a growing trend among stock exchanges around the world to link up amid intensifying competition. Earlier this month, Nasdaq, NYSE's biggest rival, signed cooperative agreements with the Korea Exchange and Tokyo-based Jasdaq.

PartyGaming said last month that its sports betting operation Gamebookers had exceeded expectations since it was bought. PartyGaming is also looking at other deals, including smaller online bingo and casino operators, the source said. Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported that Ladbrokes ( LAD.L ) and 888 were in merger talks. Ladbrokes declined to comment, while 888 reiterated its statement on Monday that it had held \"various preliminary discussions with third parties.\" A source close to 888 said: \"The founding shareholders are not desperate to sell, because they believe in the long term business.\" Many online gaming companies have been in tie-up talks as they search for potential synergies to improve margins after the United States effectively banned online gaming last month. PartyGaming spokesman John Shepherd declined to comment on the potential acquisitions but added that the company had continued to reduce its cost base by cutting jobs. \"Out of the 1,750 staff in India, we had to let go of 800,\" he said. \"It was necessary to reduce the cost base as a result of illogical, ill-conceived and inconsistent prohibition legislation in the United States,\" he added. PartyGaming offered other companies in Hyderabad, India the employees it was losing, said Shepherd. As a result, 13 companies conducted job interviews, including HSBC Technology Services, technology firm Cisco, mobile phone maker Motorola, investment bank UBS and consultancy Deloitte. \"We\\'re very pleased to have found alternative employment for a couple of hundred former employees,\" said Shepherd.',\n",

Consumer-oriented stocks such as McDonald\\'s Corp. ( MCD.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) slipped. Labor Department data showed the U.S. unemployment rate fell to its lowest in more than five years. While the economy added fewer jobs in October than economists had expected, August and September payrolls were revised significantly higher. A jump in oil prices contributed to negative sentiment. \"Some investors were hanging on the idea that the Fed would cut rates soon, which would give an extra boost to stocks. But that possibility no longer seems to be sustainable,\" said Michael Metz, chief investment officer of Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 32.50 points, or 0.27 percent, to end at 11,986.04. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 3.04 points, or 0.22 percent, to finish at 1,364.30. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  declined 3.23 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 2,330.79. For the week, the Dow slid 0.9 percent and the S&P 500 fell nearly 1 percent. The Nasdaq dropped 0.8 percent. U.S. crude oil for December delivery CLZ6 rose $1.26 to settle at $59.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the U.S. consulate in Lagos warned a militant group in Nigeria may have imminent plans to launch attacks on oil facilities. The rise in crude prices helped some energy stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) A Dow component, Exxon Mobil rose 1.4 percent, or 96 cents, to $72.15 on the New York Stock Exchange. The biggest drag on the Dow was McDonald\\'s, down 1.9 percent, or 81 cents, to $41.24 on the NYSE. The fast-food restaurant chain\\'s customers include senior citizens and others on fixed incomes, who are particularly sensitive to rising energy costs and interest rates. Shares of Wal-Mart, the world\\'s biggest retailer, fell after it lowered prices on nearly 100 key electronics items such as plasma televisions for the holiday season. For details, see <ID:nN03295629>. The stock dropped 1.6 percent, or 76 cents, to $47.53, marking its worst weekly percentage loss in more than four years. Wal-Mart was the second-heaviest weight on the Dow and also ranked among the S&P 500\\'s biggest losers. Wal-Mart\\'s move to slash prices pressured stocks of specialty electronic chains Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) and Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N. Best Buy sagged 1 percent, or 55 cents, to $52.43, while Circuit City\\'s shares slipped 0.6 percent, or 16 cents, to $25.95, both in NYSE trading. Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O shares had their biggest decline in nearly eight years, a day after the No. 1 natural and organic grocer said sales growth would slow in fiscal 2007.<ID:nN03306802>.

       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - French entertainment and telecommunications company Vivendi confirmed private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. had been interested in buying its business but talks had ended. \\n\\n \"This review, which included maintaining the current Vivendi assets within the group in order to create value, did not result in any proposition and has now ended,\" Vivendi said in a statement on Saturday. Earlier people familiar with the matter told Reuters KRR recently made a 40 billion euro ($51.10 billion) bid approach to Vivendi but that talks broke off about a month ago. French tax laws and other complications that would have arisen in achieving such a deal -- which would for example require the approvals of several governments including France -- contributed to the talks breaking down, said one source. A Vivendi spokesman declined to comment further on the matter and KKR also declined to comment. The New York Times had reported the approach earlier on Saturday, citing people involved in the talks, also saying the talks appeared to have stalled if not collapsed entirely. But one person involved in the talks suggested they could resume, according to the NYT, while another called KKR\\'s bid, the largest leveraged buyout offer in history, \"just an opening salvo,\" describing the negotiations as \"dead and not coming back.\" According to the NYT, Vivendi initiated the discussions but broke them off after weeks of what people involved described as intense meetings. KKR had been in discussions with both JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup about financing the transaction, the report said. Vivendi rejected an informal takeover offer last May from Sebastian Holdings, a Norwegian investment company that had expressed interest in buying the company and breaking it up, according to the Times. Vivendi owns Universal Music Group, the world\\'s largest music publisher, as well as France\\'s No. 2 mobile telecoms operator SFR, pay-TV unit Canal Plus and a profitable video games division. The U.S. Department of Justice, meanwhile, is looking into whether private equity firms that form consortiums are breaking antitrust laws and trying to drive buyout premiums down, the report noted.',\n",

El Mundo said the government was ready to back down on at least three of the 19 conditions its regulator had imposed. \"As this newspaper has found out, the Industry Ministry will allow the German company to continue to manage the nuclear plants that Endesa now controls,\" El Mundo said. \"It will be able to keep the coal plants and continue to operate in the Balearic and Canary Island electricity markets.\" The government was giving way on the most controversial conditions and modifying some of the others, the report said. The European Commission has threatened to take Spain to the European Court of Justice over its opposition to E.ON\\'s takeover bid. Under the conditions the energy regulator slapped on E.ON\\'s bid in July, E.ON would have to divest itself of about 32 percent of Endesa\\'s core Spanish business, equivalent to 7,396 megawatts of capacity, including all of its interests in the Asco I nuclear power station, the only one Endesa owns completely. E.ON would also have to give up any management interest in the other nuclear power stations in which Endesa has a stake, the regulator said then, claiming that the nuclear assets involved \"greater risk to public security\". E.ON would also have to sell coal-fired generating capacity that uses Spanish coal and the electricity supply business in Spain\\'s Canary and Balearic islands and the north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.

       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Dusted with an early snow, hundreds of \\nbrand-new Jeeps sit parked in neat rows in barbed-wire-fenced \\nlots at Detroit\\'s airport. \\n\\n  All dressed up with plastic on the seats and barcodes on \\nthe windshields, the convoy-in-waiting has nowhere to go since \\nChrysler dealers are balking at taking on even more inventory.  Welcome to Detroit, a nearby sign reads. Welcome, also, to \\nyet another indication of the crisis facing the American auto \\nindustry.  Since the mid-1980s, when Japanese automakers began making \\nvehicles in large volumes in the United States, Detroit\\'s \\nautomakers have talked of the need to better align production \\nwith demand and move to a model of just-in-time manufacturing.  But with the U.S. economy slowing and pressure to return to \\nprofitability mounting, DaimlerChrysler\\'s DCXGn.DE Chrysler \\nGroup now has thousands of vehicles without any clear \\ndestination.  Larger rivals General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor \\nCo. ( F.N ) are grappling with inventory problems of their own \\neven as they shut plants and shed tens of thousands of jobs.  \"Things are starting to slow down and particularly for \\nChrysler trucks,\" said IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle. \"And \\nChrysler has been slow to react to that.\"  Chrysler executives this week declined to say how many \\nvehicles remain in its \"sales bank\": previously undisclosed \\nparking lots are full of vehicles unassigned to any dealers.  The number of unsold vehicles swelled to 100,000 this year \\nbefore dropping to about 50,000 last month, Chrysler has said. \\nIt has set a goal of eliminating the surplus by year-end.  But some dealers have pushed back, accusing Chrysler of \\ntrying to force too many vehicles into its sales channel when \\nit should have been cutting production.\\n  LAWSUIT CHALLENGES INVENTORY PRACTICE  A lawsuit pending in federal court in New York by Chrysler \\ndealer Boss Motors is seeking $3 million from the automaker, \\nclaiming it tried to force the dealership to take cars it never \\nordered and then gave competing dealers unfair price breaks.  \"We\\'ve also been hearing that this was a widespread \\npractice,\" said lawyer Len Weber, who represents the \\ndealership. \"A lot of people are watching our case.\"  Chrysler spokesman Mike Palese said the suit lacked merit. \\n\"We normally look to resolve these issues in the normal course \\nof business,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s a test case or a \\nposter child. I think it\\'s just one dealer with concerns that \\ncouldn\\'t be resolved.\"  But larger dealership groups are also wary of being burned \\nby financing costs on slow-moving models.  Medford, Oregon-based dealership chain Lithia Motors \\n( LAD.N ), which relies on Chrysler for more than 40 percent of \\nits new car sales, said last week that Chrysler had asked it to \\naccept 3,100 vehicles in a promotion earlier this year. The \\nchain, which has 102 outlets, took only 50 vehicles.  \"That\\'s the kind of thing that\\'s happening. We\\'re only \\ngoing to take what we can turn,\" Sid DeBoer, chief executive of \\nLithia, told analysts on a conference call.\\n  DETROIT\\'S PROBLEMS UNDERSTATED  Meanwhile, Mike Jackson, chief executive of the No. 1 \\ndealership group AutoNation Inc. ( AN.N ), has called for the \\nDetroit-based car makers to revise their inventory reporting.  Jackson said Detroit\\'s established practice of including \\nfleet sales in inventory numbers \"dramatically understates\" the \\nproblem facing the old Big Three carmakers.  Excluding fleet sales, GM\\'s inventory would have been at a \\n94-day supply instead of a 76-day supply at the end of the \\nthird quarter. He said Ford\\'s inventory would be at 105 days \\ninstead of 75 days and Chrysler\\'s at 126 days instead of 82.  By comparison, Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) runs lean, with \\nabout a 30-day supply of unsold vehicles, while still taking \\nmarket share from all comers.  Chrysler is not the only U.S. automaker to face scrutiny on \\nits inventory. Some analysts say GM overproduced GMT-900 SUVs \\nin the third quarter at a time of heightened pressure to show \\nimproved results.  GM is relying on the GMT-900s such as the Chevy Tahoe and \\nGMC Sierra to recover from a $10.6 billion loss in 2005 and \\nslow its slide in sales and market share.  On a call with analysts last week, GM in-house sales \\nanalyst Paul Ballew said the No. 1 automaker now needed to \\nreduce its large SUV inventory.  \"The problem is that the Detroit automakers have excess \\ncapacity,\" AMR Research analyst Kevin Reale said. \"And they \\nhave to keep plants running to maintain the cost structure of \\ntheir vehicles.\"  IRN\\'s Merkle said the longer-term worry was that a \\nprolonged slowdown could show that the latest round of plant \\nclosures have not gone far enough.  \"The thing that concerns me is ... if volumes continue to \\ndrop, which they likely will, given the economic slowdown, they \\nwill still be left with excess capacity,\" he said.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks may rise slightly this week as companies wrap up a robust quarterly earnings season, but the U.S. mid-term elections and worries about an economic slowdown could keep many investors wary. \\n\\n Historically, the U.S. mid-term elections have been bullish for the stock market, according to the Stock Trader\\'s Almanac. But politically sensitive stocks could experience some volatility on Tuesday, when U.S. voters go to the polls, and on Wednesday as traders digest election results. \"The biggest variable for stocks this week is the elections,\" said Benjamin Halliburton, managing director of Traditional Capital Management in Summit, New Jersey. Many analysts and insiders of both major U.S. parties have been forecasting that the Republicans may lose control of the House of Representatives and they believe the Senate will be a close contest. Investors are expecting political gridlock, which could be good for stocks. But if Democrats pull in a stronger showing than expected, it could prompt some worries. \"Depending on how the House and Senate go, it can impact sectors differently in the market,\" said Dayle Malone, portfolio manager of Old Second Wealth Management in Chicago. \"There might be a pretty big reaction to a big change in control.\" The Democrats have vowed to take on some controversial reforms, including the repeal of President George W. Bush\\'s reduction in the tax rate on capital gains and dividends, which could make their wins a negative for stocks. \"I think the market is prepared for a split,\" Halliburton said. \"Unless you happen to see both houses of Congress go to one party, one way or the other, we\\'re not expecting a big move.\" Since 1934, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  has gained about 2.9 percent on average during the eight trading days surrounding the election, according to the almanac. When markets open on Monday, oil prices and stocks may get buffeted by reaction to the Sunday verdict that ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death by hanging. The decision delighted the Shi\\'ites he oppressed and stirred resentment in Saddam\\'s fellow Sunnis, reflecting Iraq\\'s violent sectarian divide. The sentence was delivered in the court that the United States set up after its invasion toppled Saddam in 2003. Officials have rejected suggestions that the verdict was timed to aid Bush\\'s Republicans in Tuesday\\'s elections, which have been dominated by dismay over Iraq\\'s turmoil. STRENGTH IN NUMBERS This week also marks the beginning of the end of the third-quarter earnings season. Aside from the elections and some economic data later in the week, investors will likely look to some earnings bellwethers, like Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) and Federated Department Stores Inc.FD.N for direction. Strong third-quarter earnings in the last few weeks have helped support the stock market\\'s recent momentum. But stocks have pulled back recently, so more good news on the earnings front could help boost equities. For the past week, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 0.9 percent. On Friday, the Dow closed below 12,000 for the first time since mid-October. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  dropped about 1 percent for the week and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  lost 0.8 percent. \"I think the market is still headed higher,\" said Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer of Advisors Capital Management in Paramus, New Jersey. \"This was yet one more quarter in which earnings came in stronger than expected. Analysts keep anticipating a slowdown in earnings and it just hasn\\'t happened.\" More than 80 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly earnings with nearly three-quarters of them beating analysts\\' estimates, according to Reuters Estimates. Network equipment maker Cisco, often viewed as a bellwether for technology companies and U.S. capital spending, is expected on Wednesday to post higher earnings for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2007. Results and forecasts from Federated, the parent of Macy\\'s and Bloomingdale\\'s, also will be watched closely on Wednesday so investors can get an indication on the coming holiday shopping season. \"Once we get past the election, folks start thinking about how the holiday shopping season is going, so some of the retail numbers will become important,\" Malone said. CAUTIOUS CONSUMERS Also coloring investors\\' views of the retail sector will be the University of Michigan\\'s preliminary reading on November consumer sentiment, due on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the University of Michigan\\'s November consumer sentiment index to remain the same as in October, suggesting the recent drop in energy prices has not been enough to motivate consumers to spend more. U.S. crude oil futures prices are down about 25 percent from their lifetime NYMEX high of $78.40 a barrel set on July 14.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The average cost of a gallon of gasoline in the United States fell slightly in the past two weeks as refiners and retailers kept a check on prices during a period of lower demand, an industry analyst said on Sunday. \\n\\n The national retail average for self-serve, regular unleaded gasoline was $2.1820 a gallon on November 3, down about 1.92 cents per gallon in the past two weeks, according to the nationwide Lundberg survey of about 6,000 gas stations. This is the lowest average retail gasoline price seen in 2006. Gasoline prices have fallen more than 84 cents per gallon after rising to an all-time Lundberg survey high of $3.0256 per gallon on August 11. Prices have fallen 24.37 cents from $2.4257 on November 4, 2005. \"This 2-cents drop would not have occurred if it had not been for losses in refiner and retailer profit margins,\" said survey editor Trilby Lundberg. \"The gasoline glut was already soaked up and crude oil prices did not decline further.\" Lundberg noted that crude oil prices have been stable at about $59 per barrel for several days, so any weakness in prices is based on competitive conditions. \"This is a low-demand period in the gasoline market and the economy\\'s growth is not as strong as it had been,\" she said. \"Competition has taken a bite out of the industry\\'s performance.\" At the same time, large U.S. metropolitan areas were less likely to show declines in the past two weeks and the market generally sees increased demand for heating oil during the winter months. Most price increases during the past two weeks were seen in Midwestern states, frequently the first region to log price trend changes, Lundberg said. At $2.77 a gallon, Honolulu had the highest average price for self-serve, regular gasoline, while the lowest price was $1.99 a gallon in Tulsa, Oklahoma.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Starbucks ( SBUX.O ), the icon of U.S. coffee culture, strongly defended on Sunday its business practices with poor coffee farmers around the world after it was accused of blocking the U.S. trademark application of coffee growers from Ethiopia. \\n\\n Starbucks said in a full page ad published Sunday in the New York Times that it has worked to strengthen infrastructure of coffee farms in many parts of the world. \"We do these things -- in Ethiopia, in Guatemala, in Indonesia, and other coffee growing communities around the globe -- not just because it\\'s the right way to work but because it\\'s the smart way to work,\" the ad said. Ethiopia, where coffee was first cultivated in the year 850, and British charity Oxfam accused Starbucks last month of stopping the African country from trademarking its coffee, denying farmers potential income of about 50 million pounds ($94.22 million). Oxfam said the U.S. coffee shop, famous around the world for the coffee culture it ignited from its base in Washington state, prevented Ethiopia from securing trademark protection for two of its best-known beans -- Sidamo and Harar. A blocking bid was put in by the U.S. National Coffee Association (NCA), and Oxfam accused Starbucks of being behind the action. Starbucks, which had turnover of $7.8 billion in the year to October 1, denied the accusation. Starbucks said it has provided affordable credit to small coffee farmers in the world so they can build bridges, dig wells and build water treatment facilities so they can grow coffee in \"a sustainable, profitable, ecologically sound way.\" No figures were provided by the company in its ad. If Ethiopia, one of the world\\'s poorest countries, had been  successful in trademarking its coffee beans with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, it would have allowed the country to control the use of the beans in the market, giving its farmers more of the retail price. \"Securing the trademark for its Sidamo, Harar and Yirgacheffe coffee beans could have allowed the country to increase its negotiation leverage through control of the names and ultimately (derive) a greater share of the retail price in the global market,\" Ethiopia\\'s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.',\n",

Ryanair plans to seek shareholder approval in December for\\na two-for-one share split to improve the marketability and\\nliquidity of its stock, particularly in the United States where\\nits depositary receipts are trading at over $60.  \"It has a more appealing look about it when the share price\\nis $25 to $30,\" Millar said.  Ryanair has again extended its fuel hedging, having already\\ninsured 90 percent of its needs against price rises for the\\nremainder of 2006 at an equivalent oil price of $73 a barrel.  \"We have used the recent weakness in forward oil prices to\\nhedge 50 percent of our requirements for the quarter from\\nOctober to December 2007 at a cost which is 10 percent lower\\nthan comparable Q3 this year,\" Ryanair said.  Goodbody stockbrokers analyst Joe Gill said he expected to\\nraise his earnings forecasts for this year and next.  \"Together with the planned reduction in ex-fuel unit costs\\nnext year, it (fuel hedging) provides a powerful platform for\\nprice competition and market share expansion.\"  Revenues from sources other than ticket sales, such as car\\nhire and in-flight services, rose to 87.7 million euros in the\\nquarter from 71 million in the same period last year.

       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Dusted with an early snow, hundreds of \\nbrand-new Jeeps sit parked in neat rows in barbed-wire-fenced \\nlots at Detroit\\'s airport. \\n\\n  All dressed up with plastic on the seats and barcodes on \\nthe windshields, the convoy-in-waiting has nowhere to go since \\nChrysler dealers are balking at taking on even more inventory.  Welcome to Detroit, a nearby sign reads. Welcome, also, to \\nyet another indication of the crisis facing the American auto \\nindustry.  Since the mid-1980s, when Japanese automakers began making \\nvehicles in large volumes in the United States, Detroit\\'s \\nautomakers have talked of the need to better align production \\nwith demand and move to a model of just-in-time manufacturing.  But with the U.S. economy slowing and pressure to return to \\nprofitability mounting, DaimlerChrysler\\'s DCXGn.DE Chrysler \\nGroup now has thousands of vehicles without any clear \\ndestination.  Larger rivals General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor \\nCo. ( F.N ) are grappling with inventory problems of their own \\neven as they shut plants and shed tens of thousands of jobs.  \"Things are starting to slow down and particularly for \\nChrysler trucks,\" said IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle. \"And \\nChrysler has been slow to react to that.\"  Chrysler executives this week declined to say how many \\nvehicles remain in its \"sales bank\": previously undisclosed \\nparking lots are full of vehicles unassigned to any dealers.  The number of unsold vehicles swelled to 100,000 this year \\nbefore dropping to about 50,000 last month, Chrysler has said. \\nIt has set a goal of eliminating the surplus by year-end.  But some dealers have pushed back, accusing Chrysler of \\ntrying to force too many vehicles into its sales channel when \\nit should have been cutting production.\\n  LAWSUIT CHALLENGES INVENTORY PRACTICE  A lawsuit pending in federal court in New York by Chrysler \\ndealer Boss Motors is seeking $3 million from the automaker, \\nclaiming it tried to force the dealership to take cars it never \\nordered and then gave competing dealers unfair price breaks.  \"We\\'ve also been hearing that this was a widespread \\npractice,\" said lawyer Len Weber, who represents the \\ndealership. \"A lot of people are watching our case.\"  Chrysler spokesman Mike Palese said the suit lacked merit. \\n\"We normally look to resolve these issues in the normal course \\nof business,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s a test case or a \\nposter child. I think it\\'s just one dealer with concerns that \\ncouldn\\'t be resolved.\"  But larger dealership groups are also wary of being burned \\nby financing costs on slow-moving models.  Medford, Oregon-based dealership chain Lithia Motors \\n( LAD.N ), which relies on Chrysler for more than 40 percent of \\nits new car sales, said last week that Chrysler had asked it to \\naccept 3,100 vehicles in a promotion earlier this year. The \\nchain, which has 102 outlets, took only 50 vehicles.  \"That\\'s the kind of thing that\\'s happening. We\\'re only \\ngoing to take what we can turn,\" Sid DeBoer, chief executive of \\nLithia, told analysts on a conference call.\\n  DETROIT\\'S PROBLEMS UNDERSTATED  Meanwhile, Mike Jackson, chief executive of the No. 1 \\ndealership group AutoNation Inc. ( AN.N ), has called for the \\nDetroit-based car makers to revise their inventory reporting.  Jackson said Detroit\\'s established practice of including \\nfleet sales in inventory numbers \"dramatically understates\" the \\nproblem facing the old Big Three carmakers.  Excluding fleet sales, GM\\'s inventory would have been at a \\n94-day supply instead of a 76-day supply at the end of the \\nthird quarter. He said Ford\\'s inventory would be at 105 days \\ninstead of 75 days and Chrysler\\'s at 126 days instead of 82.  By comparison, Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) runs lean, with \\nabout a 30-day supply of unsold vehicles, while still taking \\nmarket share from all comers.  Chrysler is not the only U.S. automaker to face scrutiny on \\nits inventory. Some analysts say GM overproduced GMT-900 SUVs \\nin the third quarter at a time of heightened pressure to show \\nimproved results.  GM is relying on the GMT-900s such as the Chevy Tahoe and \\nGMC Sierra to recover from a $10.6 billion loss in 2005 and \\nslow its slide in sales and market share.  On a call with analysts last week, GM in-house sales \\nanalyst Paul Ballew said the No. 1 automaker now needed to \\nreduce its large SUV inventory.  \"The problem is that the Detroit automakers have excess \\ncapacity,\" AMR Research analyst Kevin Reale said. \"And they \\nhave to keep plants running to maintain the cost structure of \\ntheir vehicles.\"  IRN\\'s Merkle said the longer-term worry was that a \\nprolonged slowdown could show that the latest round of plant \\nclosures have not gone far enough.  \"The thing that concerns me is ... if volumes continue to \\ndrop, which they likely will, given the economic slowdown, they \\nwill still be left with excess capacity,\" he said.

Ahold, the owner of U.S. supermarkets including Stop & Shop,\\nsaid it would return some 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) to\\nshareholders and cut its debt by the same amount as it announced\\nan overhaul aimed at boosting profitability.  In line with expectations, Ahold said it would sell U.S.\\nFoodservice, the unit at the centre of a nearly 1 billion euro\\naccounting scandal, as well as its U.S. Tops retail chain and\\noperations in Poland and Slovakia.  The world\\'s fourth-largest retailer said it would cut\\noperating costs by 500 million euros by the end of 2009 and sell\\nits 49 percent stake in Portugal\\'s Jeronimo Martins Retail.  \"Since the crisis in 2003, we have completed a comprehensive\\nrevitalisation programme,\" Ahold President and Chief Executive\\nAnders Moberg said in a statement.  \"It is now time for us to focus our efforts on strengthening\\nour retail competitive position, particularly in the United\\nStates.\"  Ahold\\'s review follows fierce pressure to sell its U.S.\\nFoodservice unit -- valued at as much as 5.2 billion euros by\\nanalysts and estimated to have a book value of about 4 billion\\neuros by the retailer -- from activist hedge funds Centaurus\\nCapital and Paulson & Co., owners of 6.4 percent of the group.  A source familiar with the matter said Centaurus considers\\nMonday\\'s announcements \"a step in the right direction\" but now\\nneeded to study the proposals and speak to Ahold\\'s management\\nbefore reaching a firm position.  Analysts said the asset sales could raise some 4.5 billion\\neuros.  Moberg said Ahold would make acquisitions to expand the\\nbusiness but declined to comment on expectations the asset sales\\ncould pave the way for a merger with Belgian supermarket chain\\nDelhaize DELBt.BR.  \"We are always looking into opportunities which are\\ninteresting to us as a company that can create value ... We will\\nkeep our eyes open,\" he told a press conference when asked about\\na tie-up with Delhaize.  \\n  ALL OPTIONS OPEN  Petercam analyst Fernand de Boer did not rule out a merger.  \"In our view the review still leaves all options open for a\\nfurther break-up, a full takeover or merger with Delhaize,\" he\\nsaid in a note.  Ahold shares ended 0.1 percent higherat 8.36 euros, after\\nhaving hit a 45-month high earlier at 8.65 euros. The DJ Stoxx\\nretail index was 0.4 percent firmer. Delhaize shares were 0.2\\npercent lower at 64.15 euros.  The cost of insuring Ahold debt against default fell nearly\\n20 percent and its bonds rose. At the end of the first half,\\nAhold said its debt stood at 5.2 billion euros.  Moberg, who launched the review this year after admitting\\nfierce rivalry from Kroger Co. ( KR.N ) and Safeway Inc. ( SWY.N )\\nin the United States, reaffirmed a target of retail net sales\\ngrowth of five percent and retail operating margin growth of\\nfive percent.  Analysts said the sales were in line with expectations.  \"We are positive about Ahold reaffirming its retail targets.\\nOn the negative side, we are disappointed about the fact that\\nAhold intends to return only 2 billion euros to shareholders\\nafter the divestments,\" Kempen & Co analyst Erwin Dut said.  Moberg said Ahold had not discussed potential buyers for its\\nU.S. Foodservice unit but there was \"lots of interest out\\nthere\".  Private equity firms Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Kohlberg\\nKravis Roberts and Cerberus Capital Management are interested in\\nU.S. Foodservice, a person familiar with the matter said last\\nweek.  Ahold\\'s sale of U.S. Foodservice could spur consolidation in\\nthe U.S. northeast supermarket industry, Goldman Sachs wrote in\\na note.

( GM.N ) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said on Monday that he expected the U.S. company\\'s global output this year to roughly match 2005, with sales largely overseas. \\n\\n In 2005, the world\\'s largest automaker saw the majority of its sales and production generated outside the United States for the first time, Wagoner said, adding that the trend should persist over the next decade. \"Last year, we produced about 9.2 million units globally, and I would suspect that this year we will end up with the same number of vehicles,\" Wagoner said. He is in Shanghai to start a tour of the firm\\'s facilities. The Detroit-based company, which lost $10.6 billion last year, is in the process of restructuring and plans to slash more than 34,000 jobs and close 12 plants. It is also selling a controlling state in its finance arm GMAC to shore up its capital base. Wagoner said in August that the $14 billion sale to an investor consortium, led by hedge fund Cerberus Capital Management, could hopefully be concluded before the end of the year. He stuck to that target on Monday, adding that his company would end up owning 49 percent of GMAC and Cerberus the remaining 51 percent. While conceding market share to Asian rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp.

Nick Reilly, president of GM\\'s Asia-Pacific operations, told Reuters that the U.S. giant would remain the top player in that country in 2006 and that it was working hard to retain the position in coming years. GM has two vehicle manufacturing joint ventures in China making cars and minivans. Sales jumped 37 percent to 645,680 vehicles in the January-September period, beating 25 percent growth in the overall market.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) on Monday said patients given its Taxus drug-coated stent had no greater risk of death or heart attack than those receiving a bare-metal device, despite a small but significant risk of developing dangerous blood clots with Taxus. \\n\\n Donald Baim, the company\\'s new chief medical and scientific officer, said analysis of long-term stent data showed the danger of late stent thrombosis, or blood clots, seen with Taxus was offset by the risk of restenosis, or reclogging of cleared arteries, with the older, cheaper bare metal stents and the need for repeat procedures. \"Restenosis in bare metal stents is not just a benign nuisance,\" Baim said at a meeting with analysts in Boston, noting a significant increase in heart attacks and death that can occur with revascularization procedures. Stents are tiny mesh tubes used to prop open arteries that have been cleared of plaque. Drug-coated stents have become a $5 billion a year market because of their ability to prevent the build-up of scar tissue. The incidence of blood clots seen with the increasingly popular drug-coated stents has raised concern among physicians and health officials, leading some to take a second look at the older bare-metal stents as an alternative. But Baim said a reanalysis of data from more than 3,400 patients through four years showed that the chances of death or heart attack are not only small, but equivalent or less with Taxus versus bare metal stents. \"Given that the risk is equal in terms of death and MI (heart attack), the overwhelming benefit is a reduction in number of revascularizations by 50 percent with Taxus compared with bare metal stents,\" Baim said. \"Restenosis and repeat procedures can also cause major complications and Taxus prevents them,\" he added. Baim noted that Taxus patients should take the blood clot preventer Plavix for at least six months and possibly longer, adding that prematurely stopping Plavix can increase stent thrombosis. Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), whose Cypher stent competes directly with Taxus, has said it sees no statistically significant risk of late thrombosis with its device. But Boston Scientific said data show Taxus and Cypher have similar blood clot risks. \"Clinically, scientifically, mechanistically, I have little doubt that both of these stents have a similar late stent thrombosis pattern,\" Baim said.

       "  ' HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd. ( 0992.HK ), the world\\'s third-largest computer maker, should post a second straight quarterly profit -- albeit down on a year ago -- as it rides a robust home market and makes headway in turning around a loss-making business inherited from IBM ( IBM.N ). \\n\\n But analysts said the Chinese PC giant\\'s global business would stay weak for the foreseeable future because of a lack of brand awareness and an inability to reach non-Asian consumers. Lenovo -- one of a handful of Chinese firms trying to forge a global brand by investing abroad -- has been coping with expenses arising from its US$1.25 billion purchase of IBM\\'s PC arm last year, plus stiffer competition from bigger rivals Dell Inc. DELL.O and Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ). China\\'s largest maker of personal computers, which squeezed into the black in the first fiscal quarter with a net profit of US$5 million, is expected to post a profit of HK$324.78 million ($41.74 million) for the July-September period, according to six analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. That would follow a sharp fourth-quarter loss and would be down 8 percent from a HK$354 million ($45.4 million) net profit a year ago. Analysts say the results may include a partly IBM-related restructuring charge of up to US$10 million. \"The summer season is typically good for PC sales in China and we believe Lenovo has gained market share in the third quarter,\" a JP Morgan analyst said. Lenovo is expected to post full-year net profit of HK$1.15 billion, more than six times last year\\'s HK$173.24 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of Lenovo -- the worst performer in Hong Kong\\'s blue-chip Hang Seng Index  .HSI  until August -- have recovered since it posted better-than-expected first quarter results. The stock, valued at more than $3.81 billion, rose 19 percent in July-September, beating a 7.8 percent gain on the main index, but that meant it traded at a lofty 27 times prospective earnings -- pricier than Dell\\'s 22.4 and HP\\'s 17.6, according to Reuters data. BACK HOME Despite strength on its home turf -- Lenovo commands a third of the Chinese PC market, the world\\'s largest after the United States -- the firm is struggling to expand beyond Asia. It continues to relinquish market share in major international markets due to a lack of brand recognition and consumer exposure, experts say. Chairman Yang Yuanqing told Reuters in September it would take at least three years to return to strong profitability as competition intensifies and corporate demand lags. \"Our key concern is the loss-making America business. I do not expect it to turn around until the second half of next year, when the corporate PC replacement cycle starts,\" said an analyst at Cazenove. The firm\\'s dominant share in Asia excluding Japan grew to 21 percent in the calendar third quarter from 19.9 percent in the previous quarter, according to IDC, with most growth coming from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. HP ranked second with a 12.9 percent share of the Asian market, with Dell at No.3 with 9 percent. \"We believe the market share loss is primarily due to lack of exposure in the fast-growing consumer market, while its core market segment of corporate market has remained stagnant,\" the JP Morgan analyst said. \"Such a structural problem will continue to weigh on Lenovo\\'s market share in the foreseeable future.\" ($1=7.779 Hong Kong dollar)',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A former marketing executive of Ahold NV\\'s ( AHLN.AS )AHO.N U.S.-based food distribution unit lied about earnings to boost the company\\'s profit and earn bonuses as part of an $800 million accounting fraud, a prosecutor told a jury in closing arguments on Monday. \\n\\n Mark Kaiser, who worked at Ahold\\'s U.S. FoodService unit, was on trial for conspiracy, securities fraud and making false filings for his role in a scheme where prosecutors said he and others created fake promotional allowances owed by suppliers to meet company profit targets. \"This was an astonishing degree of corruption at the highest levels of corporate America,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence Gerschwer said at the close of Kaiser\\'s month-long criminal trial in federal court in Manhattan. Ahold, which acquired Columbia, Maryland-based U.S. FoodService in 2002, said on Monday it will sell the unit as it seeks to cut costs. The Dutch company, the world\\'s fourth-biggest food-retail and food-service group by sales, is struggling to get back on track after its accounting scandal of 2003. Kaiser and U.S. FoodService\\'s former chief financial officer Michael Resnick were charged for their alleged roles in the fraud in July 2004 by a Manhattan grand jury. Resnick pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge on September 18. Prosecutors sought to prove their case against Kaiser using testimony from cooperating witnesses who were Resnick\\'s co-conspirators, testimony from the company\\'s auditors and documents. But Resnick\\'s attorney, Richard Morvillo, said the case should be decided on the credibility of the government\\'s witnesses. He singled out the testimony of Timothy Lee, a former U.S. FoodService purchasing executive, who Morvillo said lied to the jury. \"He wasn\\'t looking you in the eye and telling you the truth,\" Morvillo said, adding that Lee should be blamed for the fraud. Lee and another former U.S. FoodService executive, William Carter, pleaded guilty to criminal securities fraud in July 2004. U.S. prosecutors also brought criminal charges against 16 of the food-service company\\'s suppliers for their role in the fraud that caused U.S. FoodService and Ahold to overstate earnings by about $800 million from 2000 to 2003, according to the government. More than a dozen have pleaded guilty. On September 28, government attorneys said they would not prosecute Ahold NV for any role in the accounting fraud.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. housing market will weaken further, but the sharpest decline is over as inventories of unsold homes decrease, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Monday. \\n\\n \"This is not the bottom, but the worst is behind us,\" Greenspan said at a conference organized by financial services firm Charles Schwab. Greenspan retired from the U.S. central bank in January, but his comments have still had the power to move financial markets. A decline in U.S. home sales and construction has contributed to an overall slowing of economic growth to 1.6 percent in third quarter. But Greenspan said housing market activity is likely no longer to be a drag on overall economic growth as unsold inventories clear out and stabilize against sales levels. Fed policy-makers are watching closely to see if the slowdown in the economy will ease a little of the worrisome upward pressure that a tight labor market has been exerting on prices. Fed officials have said they are confident the housing slowdown has not spread into other areas of the economy and that slightly higher rates of growth will return in 2007. The former central banker said he is \"reasonably confident\" the United States will not slide into recession because businesses appear to be strong, as evinced by strong corporate profit margins and healthy levels of capital investment. Greenspan, whose every move as Fed chairman was scrutinized for clues about monetary policy and the economic outlook, laid to rest the legend that Fed interest rate decisions could be divined by how full his briefcase appeared to be when he went to work. \"The extent to which my briefcase was fat or thin depended on whether my wife had time to make me lunch,\" he said. On interest rates, the former Fed chair cautioned that global factors that helped push down long-term interest rates, helping fuel the U.S. housing boom of the early part of the decade, are not permanent features of the economic landscape. Greenspan once famously described the phenomenon of stubbornly low long-term interest rates, despite the Fed\\'s steady increases in short-term benchmark rates, as a conundrum. On Monday, he said that forces such as a flood of new workers into the world economy after the collapse of communism and the global integration of China were one-time events that will eventually stop playing a role in keeping long-term interest rates as persistently low. \"There is a turning point but I don\\'t know where it is,\" he said.',\n",

Growth of reserves was also likely to miss the targeted growth of 5 to 10 percent, Chief Executive Officer Doug Foshee told a conference call, although the year-end evaluation of the assets had just begun. Shares in the company fell about 2.5 percent to $13.56 per share versus a 0.6 percent gain in the broader Standard & Poor\\'s Energy index.

Boosting the quarterly earnings was a $48 million pretax gain on the mark-to-market value of contracts that El Paso said it used to hedge its natural gas and crude oil production. Revenues rose to $1.06 billion from $752 million a year ago. GULF WOES Problems in the Gulf of Mexico hurt the production unit, Foshee said, where the company has pushed back some expected output to next year. \"Whereas back in August we expected 65 to 100 million (cubic feet) a day to come on in the Gulf of Mexico by year-end, we now expect 30 million a day plus,\" he said.

Earnings from the company\\'s pipeline operations rose to $305 million from $272 million, driven by higher rates, capacity sales and new projects.',\n",

Merrill Lynch, which confirmed it had been picked as the underwriter for the IPO, declined to comment further, while an SK Corp. spokeswoman said it was considering various options about selling its stakes in SK Incheon. SK Corp. said on October 27 it was considering selling part of its 90.63 percent stake in SK Incheon as part of its effort to pay off debt. In December 2005, SK Corp. signed a final deal to pay about $1.6 billion for the stake and acquired about $1.4 billion of its debt.

Commenting on the cuts already agreed by OPEC, Daukoru said: \"You will not see it but we have taken action and probably into the middle of the month, you will believe us.\" Asked how much was being cut, he replied: \"I can\\'t tell you.\" Output from the group, supplier of around a third of the world\\'s oil, is expected to slip in November after OPEC agreed last month to cut supplies by 1.2 million bpd. Analysts are skeptical OPEC will cut the full amount and so far only buyers of crude from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Algeria have confirmed those three members have made cuts totaling over 500,000 bpd. NIGERIA ATTACKS Daukoru insisted that the latest violence in the Niger Delta was a social rather than political issue and that a Briton and an American kidnapped in the area would be released soon. \"We are aware of this, we are engaging seriously and regret the situation,\" he said. The two were kidnapped from an oil industry ship off the southern Nigerian state of Bayelsa, one of Nigeria\\'s top oil producing states at the heart of the Niger Delta. The state government on Sunday had said it expected them to be released on Monday. The abduction of the two employees of Norway\\'s Petroleum Geo-Services ( PGS.OL ) by villagers in a community dispute is part of a series of attacks on foreigners in the world\\'s eighth largest oil exporter. The violence has forced hundreds of workers to pull out and has cut oil output from Africa\\'s top producer by 500,000 barrels a day since February. On Monday suspected militants invaded an oil production facility operated by Italian oil company Agip at Tebidaba in southern Nigeria on Monday, a government official said. Daukoru also said that Nigeria would announce new bids for 56 oil blocks \"very soon.\" Daukoru said there were 56 blocks, \"which is a little bit less than what we finalized.\"',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Starbucks ( SBUX.O ), the icon of U.S. coffee culture, strongly defended on Sunday its business practices with poor coffee farmers around the world after it was accused of blocking the U.S. trademark application of coffee growers from Ethiopia. \\n\\n Starbucks said in a full page ad published Sunday in the New York Times that it has worked to strengthen infrastructure of coffee farms in many parts of the world. \"We do these things -- in Ethiopia, in Guatemala, in Indonesia, and other coffee growing communities around the globe -- not just because it\\'s the right way to work but because it\\'s the smart way to work,\" the ad said. Ethiopia, where coffee was first cultivated in the year 850, and British charity Oxfam accused Starbucks last month of stopping the African country from trademarking its coffee, denying farmers potential income of about 50 million pounds ($94.22 million). Oxfam said the U.S. coffee shop, famous around the world for the coffee culture it ignited from its base in Washington state, prevented Ethiopia from securing trademark protection for two of its best-known beans -- Sidamo and Harar. A blocking bid was put in by the U.S. National Coffee Association (NCA), and Oxfam accused Starbucks of being behind the action. Starbucks, which had turnover of $7.8 billion in the year to October 1, denied the accusation. Starbucks said it has provided affordable credit to small coffee farmers in the world so they can build bridges, dig wells and build water treatment facilities so they can grow coffee in \"a sustainable, profitable, ecologically sound way.\" No figures were provided by the company in its ad. If Ethiopia, one of the world\\'s poorest countries, had been  successful in trademarking its coffee beans with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, it would have allowed the country to control the use of the beans in the market, giving its farmers more of the retail price. \"Securing the trademark for its Sidamo, Harar and Yirgacheffe coffee beans could have allowed the country to increase its negotiation leverage through control of the names and ultimately (derive) a greater share of the retail price in the global market,\" Ethiopia\\'s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. radio operators on Monday said sales of its high-definition radios will expand to Circuit City CC.N, and stations are set to air some 75,000 ads a week pushing HD Digital radio, in an effort to defend its turf against satellite radio and iPods. \\n\\n In the latest phase of a $200 million marketing push, timed to take advantage of the holiday season, the radio industry starting November 13 will also cut prices, bringing some automotive units to around $150, according to the HD Digital Radio Alliance, a group of broadcasters hoping to speed consumer adoption of HD Digital Radio. Along with its arrival at \"big-box retailer\" Circuit City, the radios will also be found in additional RadioShack ( RSH.N ) locations, where they had been selling in selected regions. The moves comes at a time when holiday shoppers may already be checking off lists for other digital music players, such as new versions of Apple Computer Inc.\\'s ( AAPL.O ) Inc.\\'s iPod, recently discounted models of Sandisk\\'s Sansa or Microsoft\\'s Zune, which will debut later this month. A consumer who buys or owns an iPod may still take interest in HD radio, which receives over-the-air terrestrial stations with CD-quality sound and multiple new-program formats, says Peter Ferrara, chief executive of the HD Digital Radio Alliance. He said radio listeners, who have already simultaneously owned CD players, cassette players and iPods, are comfortable using more than one system. \"I don\\'t want to set any false expectation that this will be the \\'HD Radio Christmas\\' -- we don\\'t think that is the case. But I think we have a foot well in the door right now,\" he told Reuters in an interview. Shoppers who listen to traditional radio will be hard pressed to miss on-air ads for HD radio, since many stations will air 150 commercials per week. The stakes remain high for traditional radio, which has lost listeners tuning into commercial-free options offered by satellite radio or digital music players that can store hundreds of songs that consumers chose themselves. Indeed after buying one of those other items, they may not desire spending more on radio, which is often seen as a free commodity. Ferrara said the industry is optimistic and has seen solid return for its $200 million marketing investment in HD digital radio. Ferrara, who in August said some 100,000 units had been sold, declined to update the total number of radio sold during the course of the 10-month push. However, he said he remains optimistic that more and more, HD radio technology will become standard, and that a wave of sales to consumers replacing older radios -- from alarm clock radios to car radios -- is due in 2007 and 2008. \"I think we are still in the early stages of the adoption curve and the understanding of the technology by the consumer,\" he said. \"There are ... about 70 to 80 million AM/FM radios sold each year in the U.S. We will get in (that) roll as more products become available, and as the technology becomes easier to purchase because of the price point and the availability.\"',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc. ( ABT.N ) said on Monday it will acquire Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. KOSP.O in a $3.7 billion deal that would make it the leader in the hot field of drugs to boost \"good\" HDL cholesterol. \\n\\n Abbott, based in suburban Chicago, said it would pay Kos shareholders $78 per share in cash, marking a 56 percent premium over Kos\\' closing share price of $50.09 on Friday. Abbott said the deal will cost $3.7 billion after it receives Kos\\' cash holdings of $400 million. Kos\\' main products -- Niaspan and Advicor -- incorporate prescription forms of the nutrient niacin, which boosts HDL. Sales of the products have surged, pushing up Kos\\' share price, amid increasing evidence that low levels of heart-protective HDL may be a bigger cause of heart disease than high levels of artery-clogging \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. Other types of Kos products in development would be icing on the cake for Abbott, including an asthma drug in late-stage trials and a form of inhaled insulin now in mid-stage studies. \"Inhaled insulin would be important because of our growing diabetes business,\" Abbott spokeswoman Melissa Brotz said, referring to Abbott sales of $1.1 billion in 2005 from its line of diabetes diagnostic products -- including blood glucose strips and meters. Abbott said it expects the deal to hurt earnings per share in 2007 by 2 cents to 3 cents, and be neutral to positive for earnings in 2008. \"Abbott shareholders over the long haul will be pleasantly pleased in what they\\'ve acquired through the Kos deal,\" predicted Robert Hazlett, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets. The transaction is the latest in a flood of big acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals sector as drug companies, struggling to develop new products of their own, compete to acquire them from others, typically biotechnology companies. And analysts have been surprised at the premiums being paid -- some think Abbott may be paying too much too. \"I\\'m a little surprised at the premium,\" said Bruce Cranna, an analyst at Leerink Swann & Co. \"This is a space Abbott has expressed interest in, but I\\'m not quite sure that they have enough critical mass in the primary-care physician marketplace versus the specialist market.\" BMO\\'s Hazlett said Niaspan and Advicor should bring Kos combined sales of $650 million this year, but he predicted annual sales of the two drugs and improved versions of them could eventually top $2 billion when bolstered by Abbott\\'s larger sales force and marketing budget. The deal underscores Abbott\\'s determination to become a major player in the cardiovascular market. It already sells the $1 billion-a-year Tricor, which cuts levels of blood fats called triglycerides, and is developing a pill that combines Tricor with AstraZeneca\\'s ( AZN.L ) Crestor -- one of the most potent drugs against LDL cholesterol. Moreover, Abbott recently launched in Europe its drug-coated Xience stent, which has proven to be more effective in clinical tests than Boston Scientific\\'s ( BSX.N )market-leading Taxus device to prop open coronary arteries. Kos, meanwhile, is conducting late-stage trials of a new product called Simcor that combines Niaspan and a generic version of Merck & Co.\\'s ( MRK.N ) LDL-lowering Zocor. Kos has been bracing for a marketing battle with Merck, which is developing its own niacin-based products to boost HDL. Merck suffered a setback in September when it announced it would delay seeking approval for a triple-combination product that combines niacin, Zocor and a third ingredient designed to block the facial flushing that is often a side effect of niacin. Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) is betting heavily on HDL as well, spending $800 million on ongoing late-stage trials of a drug called torcetrapib that could reach drugstores by 2011, if U.S. regulators approve it despite its tendency to raise blood pressure in clinical trials. Shares of Kos jumped $26.90, or 54 percent, to a 52-week high of $76.99 in heavy morning trade on the Nasdaq. Abbott shares slipped 16 cents to $47.48 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shareholders owning a majority of the shares of Kos\\' common stock have agreed to tender their shares or have their shares acquired by Abbott, the companies said.

       "  ' TORONTO  (Reuters) - Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and an investment firm owned by Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) Chairman Bill Gates launched an offer for Four Seasons Hotels Inc. FSH.TO FS.N on Monday that proposes to take the Canadian luxury hotelier private. \\n\\n News of the bid from two of the world\\'s richest men sent the company\\'s stock up more than 29 percent, slightly topping the bid price of $82 a share in cash. The suitors for Four Seasons include Prince Alwaleed\\'s Kingdom Hotels International, Gates\\' Cascade Investment LLC and Four Seasons\\' founder Isadore Sharp and his family holding company, Triples Holdings Ltd. Four Seasons said the deal values the company at $3.7 billion. The valuation takes into account 41.1 million in outstanding limited and variable multiple voting shares, a $288 million payout to Sharp and net debt. The group\\'s bid represents a 28.4-percent premium over Four Seasons\\' closing share price of $63.87 in New York on Friday. The stock gained $18.63 to end at $82.50 on Monday in New York, and surged C$20.95 to close at C$93.06 in Toronto. Several analysts said a counterbid is unlikely. \"These are good quality investors, and Sharp would not sell to fast money private equity firms, so I don\\'t see another player coming in the picture,\" said Jacques Kavafian, an analyst at Research Capital. Prince Alwaleed already has a 23-percent stake in Four Seasons, according to Reuters Knowledge, while Cascade said in a filing on Monday that it owns 8.2 percent of the company. This is the Saudi billionaire\\'s second foray into the Canadian hotel segment this year. In January, his Kingdom Hotels joined forces with a U.S investment group to buy another luxury chain, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, for $3.9 billion. Deutsche Bank Securities analyst Bill Lerner estimated that the $82-a-share offer values Four Seasons at a \"curiously strong\" ratio of 44.4 times expected fiscal 2007 earnings per share and 31.9 times expected 2007 EV/EBITDA. Lerner said the deal could be part of a broader strategy to blend the global marketing and distribution of the Four Seasons and Fairmont brands. Sharp, 75, who will remain chairman and chief executive of Four Seasons, said the proposed deal would change little at the company, which manages about 68 hotels around the world, beyond its ownership. The deal was driven by a desire to find long-term partners and oversee the ownership transition while still head of the company he founded, Sharp said on a conference call. Sharp\\'s Triples Holdings now controls about 65 percent of the voting rights in Four Seasons through multiple-voting shares, a spokeswoman said. If the deal goes through, Triples would have a 10-percent stake of the hotel chain, with the remaining shares split equally between Kingdom and Cascade. Sharp would also gain $288 million from the bid, relating to a long-term incentive agreement created in 1989. The offer is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and the company\\'s board has established a special committee of independent directors to consider it. It would be surprising if the board of Four Seasons rejects the offer because of the high premium and longstanding relationship between the company, Prince Alwaleed and Gates, who both own several Four Seasons hotels, UBS analyst William Truelove said in a note to clients.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - OSI Restaurant Partners Inc. OSI.N, owner of the Outback Steakhouse chain, on Monday said it planned to go private in a $3.04 billion buyout that includes its founders and private equity firms Bain Capital Partners and Catterton Partners. \\n\\n The company, whose restaurant chains have struggled as customers cut back on spending in the wake of higher gasoline prices, said it would consider better offers. The deal values the company at $40 per share, a 23.3 percent premium over Friday\\'s closing price, and sent OSI stock up to that level. \"We didn\\'t have anything that really compared to this offer,\" OSI Chief Executive Bill Allen said in an interview. OSI also disclosed more details of a previously announced financial restatement, increasing the estimated size of its liability for understated revenue. The decision to accept the offer from the private equity firms and company founders Chris Sullivan, Robert Basham and J. Timothy Gannon came after OSI hired Wachovia Securities in April to study its options. It also follows pressure from activist fund Pirate Capital to break up the company. \"While gasoline prices and home heating prices are better, there are significant reasons to think that this down cycle will continue for a period of time,\" Allen said. Shares of OSI gained $7.41, or 22.9 percent, to $39.84 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade after rising as high as $40.50. It hit a four-year low of $27.30 on July 31. \"It\\'s been a difficult operating environment and the company\\'s stock performance certainly highlights that,\" said Johnson Rice & Co. restaurant analyst Mark Sheridan. Private equity investors have a different tolerance level, Sheridan said, allowing a company to restructure and make operational improvements over a longer time frame. BRAND IMPROVEMENT OSI will need another 18 to 24 months to work on improving its core brand, CEO Allen said. The company intends to follow through on plans stated this summer to slow expansion to 100 restaurants in 2007, he said, and it will stick by its decision to keep the chains that Pirate had pushed it to spin off, including Carrabba\\'s Italian Grill and Bonefish Grill. OSI said its board had approved the deal and recommended it to shareholders, based on the unanimous approval of a special committee of independent directors. The committee and its advisers will solicit superior proposals -- in what is known as a \"go-shop\" provision -- from other parties in the next 50 days. Such provisions have become standard as management-led buyouts have soared this year with the increase in funding available from private equity firms. Another bidder, perhaps a different private equity firm, may come forward, according to one trader. \"With all the money that\\'s currently around from private investors and with a bid on the table from Bain Capital, the expectations are that there\\'s going to be at least some other people looking at the deal,\" said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. Both Bain and Catterton already have restaurant investments, including Bain\\'s stakes in Domino\\'s Pizza Inc. ( DPZ.N ), Burger King Corp. BKC.N and Dunkin Brands, the parent company of Dunkin Donuts. Catterton was an investor in Baja Fresh and P.F. Changs China Bistro Inc. and now backs the Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. ( HOT.N ) restaurant venture with chef Jean-George Vongerichten along with Cheddar\\'s Holding Corp. Including assumed debt, OSI Restaurant said the deal was worth about $3.2 billion. The company expects the transaction to close before the end of April. RESTATEMENT OSI said it would restate results, and previously issued financial statements were no longer reliable. The company had said in October it was delaying the release of its third-quarter results because of the restatement, which will correct a previously announced understatement in its liability for unearned revenue on unredeemed gift cards. In October, it said it had tentatively determined it had understated its liability for unearned revenue for unredeemed gift cards and certificates by $20 million to $40 million. It now expects to record an adjustment to its unearned revenue liability of about $50 million to $70 million at September 30. (With reporting by Chelsea Emery in New York, Dilipp S.

Linde, which bought British rival BOC for 8.2 billion pounds earlier this year to create the world\\'s largest industrial gases producer, said the deal was subject to antitrust approval. \"Linde has earned a very good price,\" said a Frankfurt-based analyst, adding that the speed with which the deal had been struck was impressive. \"Shedding the forklifts business removes the remaining conglomerate discount for the future Linde Group,\" said Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, raising its share-price target to 88 euros from 82. Linde said in a statement the new financial owners would honor all guarantees Linde gave workers for plants in summer 2005. Management had struck a deal with workers to keep forklift plants in Germany until 2011 in return for longer working hours and cuts of some benefits to boost profitability, abandoning an earlier threat to move production to eastern Europe. Linde, which doubled its size through the leveraged BOC deal, wanted to sell its forklift business to become a pure-play gases producer. Analysts have said they expect Linde to use the proceeds to cut its debt, which rose to 13.13 billion euros at the end of September from 2.42 billion at the end of 2005 due to the BOC acquisition. The deal put Kion\\'s enterprise value at 4 billion euros, consisting of a net equity value of 3.6 billion euros plus 400 million in net liabilities. IPO IN MEDIUM TERM \"We are utterly convinced that KKR and Goldman Sachs have the right overall concept for the group,\" Linde Chief Executive Wolfgang Reitzle said in a statement. KKR and Goldman Sachs said they planned an initial public offering for Kion in the medium term. A spokesman for KKR said that an initial public offering was conceivable from 2010 onwards. He said the growth strategy for the business would involve fresh funds for further acquisitions. \"We will seek to tap the undoubted potential for growth and earnings in the company and to achieve sustainable increases in its value,\" Johannes Huth, European head of KKR, and Alexander Dibelius, head of central and eastern European operations for Goldman Sachs, said in a joint statement. Kion, which says it is market leader in Europe, is an umbrella company for Linde\\'s three forklift truck and industrial equipment brands, Linde, Still and OM. It has more than 20,000 staff. In 2005, the division achieved sales of around 3.6 billion euros, Linde said. The sale contract was signed on Sunday. (Additional reporting by Frank Siebelt)',\n",

The Nasdaq Composite Index rose35.16 points, or 1.51 percent, to close at 2,365.95. Takeovers also suggest industry experts consider stock prices attractive and reflect confidence in the economic outlook. Traders said volume was modest ahead of Tuesday\\'s elections. Opinion polls show Republicans gaining ground in some key Senate races, but Democrats were still positioned to make gains in the Senate and recapture control of the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time since 1994. If the election results in political gridlock, as polls indicate, analysts said that could be a positive for the markets. Abbott said it would acquire Kos Pharmaceuticals in a $3.7 billion deal, and restaurant operator OSI said it agreed to be acquired by an investor group in a transaction worth about $3.2 billion. Drug wholesaler McKesson Corp. said it agreed to buy health administration company Per-Se Technologies for $1.23 billion, broadening its portfolio of health-care software.  Per-Se shares jumped 12.7 percent, or $3.10, to $27.55, while Kos Pharmaceuticals shares surged 53.8 percent, or $26.97, to $77.06, both in Nasdaq trading. On the New York Stock Exchange, OSI shares jumped nearly 23 percent, or $7.32, to $39.75 and McKesson shares climbed 2.4 percent to $49.69. But Abbott shares dipped 0.4 percent, or 17 cents, to $47.47 in NYSE trading. Swift shares surged 24.1 percent, or $5.79, to $29.84 on Nasdaq after the trucking company said it had received an offer from Jerry Moyes, its largest shareholder and former chief executive.  U.S.-listed shares of Four Seasons soared 29.2 percent, or $18.63, to $82.50, making them the biggest percentage gainer on the NYSE.

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Google Inc. is set to begin helping customers buy advertisements in 50 U.S. newspapers in a test of how the Web search leader can extend its business into offline media, the company said on Sunday. \\n\\n Google said it has invited more than 100 advertisers already buying ads through its Web marketing system to join a three-month test of a Print Ads service that places ads in daily papers including the New York Times and Washington Post. If the trial is successful, Google could extend the program to hundreds of thousands of its online advertising customers, offering newspapers a broad new sales channel that could help offset an ongoing decline in classified print advertising. \"For advertisers, it gives them access to a network of newspapers through an online interface and the ability to potentially reach a new customer base,\" Google spokesman Michael Mayzel said in response to questions via e-mail. A year ago, Google, of Mountain View, California, began an earlier test in which it started selling print advertising in a handful of magazines, including PC Magazine. However, demand for the service was slow to take off, executives said in May. Mayzel contrasted the earlier magazine program to the current newspaper test by saying that, \"This test is not an auction and we are not buying and reselling ad space.\" In effect, Google is giving greater control over how ad sales are made. Advertisers log into the Google AdWords system and select newspapers and available ad space, then upload the advertising artwork. But newspaper publishers retain creative and financial control over whether to approve or reject bids. The advertisements will appear in 50 metropolitan newspapers, including the Boston Globe, Seattle Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune, along with papers in the Gannett Co. Inc. newspaper chain, the Google spokesman said. Print advertising joins efforts by Google to expand into radio and video ads, allowing it to move beyond its Web-search marketing business that delivers pay-per-click text ads on its own site and others and accounts for the bulk of its revenue. Google already offers click-to-play video ads through Web sites in its ad affiliate network. It has said it plans to start a public test of its Google Audio Ads that brokers ads on radio stations by the end of this year, Mayzel said. During the test program, Google\\'s services will be free, but it plans on taking a sales commission eventually. \"In the future, we will set up a revenue share model where the majority of the ad revenue will go to the publisher,\" he said.',\n",

Mittal Steel ( MT.N ), which took over Luxembourg\\'s Arcelor after a ferocious battle of words, had pledged to keep an Arcelor man as chief executive following the merger of the two groups in a bid to calm political opposition to the deal. Arcelor Mittal said in a statement on Monday that the board of directors had unanimously appointed Lakshmi Mittal as the new chief to replace Roland Junck of Arcelor, who would remain a member of the group management board. \"We are making these changes to clarify the leadership of the company. It had become clear over the past months that the interests of the company were not best served by the previous structure,\" said Joseph Kinsch, chairman of the board, who had been a leading Arcelor figure resisting Mittal\\'s advances. The move, which will also add Lakshmi Mittal to the group management board and take effect immediately, will be put to the group\\'s shareholders for a vote in which the Mittal family will not participate. The takeover battle for Arcelor by Mittal ended in late June and by the end of August Mittal Steel held 93.7 percent of Arcelor\\'s shares. The merger should be completed in April or May next year, Kinsch said. Mittal shares dipped 1.0 percent to 32.67 euros by 1150 GMT after the news. The Dow Jones European base resources index .SXPP was up 0.9 percent at the time. MOVE EXPECTED A London-based analyst, who declined to be named, said it was no great surprise. \"Pretty much everyone knew who the leader of the group was. The chief has not really changed. But why let investors, especially French investors wait until now? It was always going to be the case,\" he said. Colette Neuville, head of the Adam minority shareholder group, said it was a shame Mittal had not said from the start that he would head the group. \"But it doesn\\'t pose a problem as long as there are effective checks and balances in the company and that for example board members play their role fully,\" she said. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker told local radio he took note of Junck\\'s resignation with \"extreme regret\". The company will remain headquartered in Luxembourg. Lakshmi Mittal had been a non-executive president of the group and was due to succeed Kinsch as chairman when the latter retired. Mittal had always been the figurehead of the merging group. Junck, a low profile Arcelor executive, had given few interviews in his brief period in charge. Arcelor Mittal said EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) amounted to $4.35 billion, compared with the average forecast of $4.29 billion from a poll of seven analysts by Reuters. \"The anticipated low seasonal volume was offset by a strong rise in steel prices... Looking ahead, we are on track to deliver guidance for the full year,\" Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal said in a statement. Third-quarter sales amounted to $22.1 billion compared with the average forecast from the poll of $23.07 billion. Arcelor Mittal said the integration of the two groups was progressing well. \"Due to planned production cut-backs in European and American operations, the company expects fourth quarter EBITDA to be below third quarter levels,\" it said, adding 2006 EBITDA should be in line with expectations at $15.2-15.4 billion.

       "  ' AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch retailer Ahold ( AHLN.AS )AHO.N is expected to announce a wide-ranging overhaul of its business on Monday that may include the sale of underperforming assets and cost cuts. \\n\\n Ahold has been struggling to boost profitability and recover from an accounting scandal as hedge funds Centaurus Capital and Paulson & Co., which together own about 6.4 percent of the retailer, are pushing it to sell its flagging U.S. activities, including its U.S. Foodservice unit. Ahold, the world\\'s fourth-biggest food retail and foodservice group in terms of sales, has refused to meet with the funds until it completes its review, which will be detailed in an 1145 GMT announcement, followed by a news conference. Ahold shares were trading 0.48 percent up at 8.39 euros at 0921 GMT, outperforming a 0.1 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx retail index .SXRP, as investors waited for news of its long-anticipated retail review. \"The market is expecting the sale of U.S. Foodservice. It is not illogical as it is not really a retail business. Downside risks are very limited for Ahold as speculation on a merger or more drastic action will remain whatever it does,\" said Lex Boumeester, a trader at Delta Lloyd. Buoyed by merger and asset disposal talk, Ahold shares have gained 32 percent since the start of the year versus a 23.6 percent increase in the DJ Stoxx retail index. The stock trades at 17 times estimated 2006 earnings against France\\'s Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) at 18 times. Analysts said selling off assets, especially U.S. Foodservice, followed by a share buyback, could help Ahold to regain an investment-grade credit rating and pave the way for the return of dividends for shareholders. The U.S. Foodservice business, which sells catering supplies, had 14.87 billion euros ($19 billion) in 2005 sales, one-third of the group\\'s revenues, but has few synergies with Ahold\\'s core food retail business. Some private equity firms, including Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (which bought Ahold\\'s Stop & Shop chain) and Cerberus Capital Management are interested in the U.S. Foodservice business, a source familiar with the matter said last week. A slimmed-down Ahold would also find it easier to merge with Belgian rival Delhaize DELBt.BR, which has a market value about half of the Dutch group\\'s, analysts have said. Ahold also has a retail presence in the United States with combined 2005 sales of 18.15 billion euros, or 41 percent of the total, but is facing stiff competition from U.S. retailers such as Kroger Co. ( KR.N ) and Safeway Inc. ( SWY.N ). Few expect Ahold to dispose of its core Albert Heijn unit in the Netherlands, one of its most profitable supermarket units, but lossmaking operations in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are considered prime targets for disposal.',\n",

The report sent down shares in the biggest local player, Mixi Inc. Murdoch, News Corp. chairman and chief executive, said \"all sorts of things, like putting MySpace on mobile,\" will be up for discussion when he meets Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son. Murdoch was speaking on the sidelines of an international conference in Tokyo. \"If we do anything with him, which I hope we will in new media, it certainly won\\'t be on an exclusive basis,\" Murdoch said. He added that finding partnerships is the preferable way to enter new markets, especially in Asia, for MySpace services. Shares of Mixi, which debuted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in September, tumbled 5 percent to 2.14 million yen due to investor concerns that MySpace could take away some of its subscribers. Softbank\\'s shares fell 1.2 percent to 2,410 yen, while the benchmark Nikkei average was up 0.1 percent. MySpace, which has some 125 million users worldwide, may be attractive to the growing number of Japanese Internet users looking to share ideas and submit diary entries with a group of friends online. \"MySpace is seen as having a high potential in Japan,\" said Atsuo Takahashi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities. \"If Softbank can offer MySpace exclusively, it could be an effective differentiation strategy,\" he added. Mixi, which began its service in 2004, has more than quintupled its members to over 5 million since last year. News Corp. and Softbank, which jointly took a stake in a Japanese TV station in 1996, are expected to announce the deal as early as this week after a meeting between Murdoch and Son, the paper said. The joint venture will start with capital of about 1 billion yen ($8.5 million), the Nikkei newspaper said. Softbank spokesman Takeaki Nukii declined to comment. News Corp. bought MySpace.com, which is popular with teenagers, last year for an estimated $580 million and has transformed it into one of the Internet\\'s fastest-growing properties. In Japan, there were about 7.16 million subscribers to so-called social networking sites as of March this year, and that number is expected to rise to 7.51 million by March 2007, according to government data. GREE Inc., the closest rival to Mixi, this year tied up with Japan\\'s No. 2 mobile phone operator KDDI Corp., to expand its service to wireless users. Softbank\\'s Internet arm, Yahoo Japan Corp., also offers a smaller online network service. A research note by UBS said in June that News Corp. and Softbank would set up a joint venture to launch MySpace.com in Japan by mid-September, citing comments by Murdoch.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Trucking company Swift Transportation Co. Inc. SWFT.O has received a $29-per-share buyout bid from its largest shareholder, former Chief Executive Jerry Moyes, the company said on Monday. \\n\\n In its quarterly earnings report on October 25, Swift reported 75.9 million shares outstanding, making the takeover offer worth about $2.2 billion. The shares rose above the offer price in Nasdaq trade -- jumping 24 percent to $29.80. Analysts said the bid may undervalue the company because trucking company stocks have been hurt in recent months by fears of a U.S. economic slowdown. Phoenix-based Swift, which operates a fleet of about 18,000 tractors and 52,000 trailers from a network of more than 30 terminals, said its board has set up a special committee to evaluate the offer. In a letter to the board, Moyes, currently a director, said he has received a written commitment from Morgan Stanley to provide all necessary debt financing for the deal. \"Given Swift\\'s recent performance, $29.00 per share is a full and fair price for Swift\\'s common stock,\" Moyes wrote in his letter, dated November 3, \"providing an attractive opportunity for its stockholders to maximize the value of their investment in Swift.\" Moyes added that he could be persuaded to go higher than $29 a share. \"I am prepared to consider any factors that you believe justify a higher purchase price, and, upon completion of due diligence, I may be willing to increase my proposed price,\" he wrote. In a research note, UBS transportation analyst Rick Paterson wrote that this \"clearly leaves the door open for a premium above\" the current offer. Swift\\'s board has until November 20 to consider the offer, Moyes wrote in his letter. Moyes told Reuters in a telephone interview on Monday that he will \"pull the offer\" after November 20, but did not say what his next step would be if his bid is rejected. \"I encourage shareholders to look at this fair offer seriously,\" he said. Swift is currently working its way through a program to boost its bottom line and improve its services. Some analysts say a higher offer price may come. \"We believe the deal may require a higher premium, given depressed valuations of the group and given that Swift continues to successfully execute on its turnaround,\" R.W Baird & Co. analyst Jon Langenfeld wrote in a research note. \"We remain neutral on the truckers (including Swift) but recognize this proposal will aid investor sentiment for the broader trucking group,\" he added. Langenfeld wrote that the potential upside that the bid brings may boost trucking outfits J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. ( JBHT.O ), Heartland Express Inc. ( HTLD.O ) and Con-way Inc.  ( CNW.N ). Paterson of UBS wrote, \"We see Swift as a long-term margin story and have every confidence that it would be able to attain a fair market value of $29 a share without a takeover.\" \"Therefore the offer from ... Moyes essentially represents a timing issue and opportunity for investors to realize those gains earlier,\" he added.',\n",

Ablynx is pioneering medicines called nanobodies, which it believes could treat conditions including arthritis, thrombosis, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. It expects to start testing them on humans early in 2007. Its nanobodies are produced by cloning DNA sequences from llamas, which possess fully functional antibodies that are much smaller than those in humans and other animals. As a result, nanobodies may reach new targets in the body and could potentially be given by mouth rather than injection. Ablynx has granted Wyeth exclusive worldwide rights to use the technology to target tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF), a protein implicated in inflammation which is inhibited by existing injectable drugs like Wyeth's Enbrel. Rivals to Enbrel include Johnson & Johnson's Remicade and Abbott Laboratories Inc.'s Humira. Under the agreement, Ablynx and Wyeth will collaborate to advance drug candidates through preclinical development. Ablynx -- which hopes to go public next year -- will receive an initial payment, research support and milestone payments that could total $212.5 million.

Robson said the deal would also improve the company\\'s access to capital. \"Through this we effectively create one organization,\" said Steve Tait, president of RSM McGladrey in an interview with Reuters. \"We\\'re trying to create a very compelling alternative to the \\'Big Four\\' in the UK. We know the economy at large needs a serious alternative to the \\'Big Four\\' to emerge and we\\'re trying to be that.\" The \"Big Four\" firms, which include Deloitte & Touche DLTE.UL, Ernst & Young ERNY.UL, PricewaterhouseCoopers PWC.UL and KPMG KPMG.UL, audit about 80 percent of all the public companies in the United States. An August British government report said the \"Big Four\" audit about 97 percent of the FTSE 350. They also tend to dominate the global tax and advisory consulting services markets, although corporate reforms in the United States have restricted their ability to provide certain advisory services to companies they audit. The RSM deal is unique as accounting firms are typically run through a partnership structure, where each partnership is owned in the country where it is based and affiliated with a larger global network. \"This is the first time that there has been a U.S. to U.K. tie up that officially creates one-managed, one-owned integrated business,\" Tait said. \"Networks only go so far, but integration can go a lot further.\" The combined firm will remain an affiliate of the RSM International network.

       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) said on Tuesday its third-quarter loss was a bit smaller than it had announced due to a late loan sale by its finance arm. \\n\\n The world\\'s largest automaker, in its quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, revised the loss to $91 million, or 16 cents a share, from the $115 million, or 20 cents a share, it had reported late last month as part of its preliminary quarterly results. GM also increased third-quarter revenue to $48.9 billion from $48.8 billion. A spokeswoman for GM\\'s finance arm General Motors Acceptance Corp. said the unit settled a deal to securitize a loan after GM reported preliminary earnings. \"There is always a period of time between the preliminary results and the filing. We had a securitization clear in that time, so it\\'s more a function of reporting timeline than anything else.\" GM said it still estimates its exposure for benefit guarantees to bankrupt Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK, a former GM unit, to be between $6 billion and $7.5 billion, but added it would likely be \"near the low end\" of the range. GM, which spun off Delphi in 1999, has been in talks with the parts supplier and its unions over a cost-saving labor deal that would allow Delphi to emerge from bankruptcy. A deal between the United Auto Workers union, Delphi and GM would avert a strike that could shut down GM\\'s production. On Tuesday, GM said Delphi continues to assure the automaker it expects no disruption in its supply of systems, components and parts. \"Although the challenges faced by Delphi during its restructuring process could create operating and financial risks for GM, that process is also expected to present opportunities for GM,\" the automaker said in the filing. \"These opportunities include reducing, over the long term, the significant cost penalty GM incurs in obtaining parts from Delphi,\" it added. In another closely watched matter, GM repeated it expects to close the $15 billion sale of a 51 percent stake in its finance arm in the fourth quarter. GM also said GMAC continues to cooperate with SEC and federal grand jury subpoenas related to investigations into industrywide practices on loss mitigation insurance products, such as finite risk insurance. The automaker is also under investigation for its transactions in precious raw metals as well as its method of booking credits from suppliers. UNDER PRESSURE The quarterly results come as Chief Executive Rick Wagoner is under pressure to show progress in the company\\'s turnaround. GM, which lost $10.6 billion in 2005, saw global sales fall 2.5 percent in the first nine months of 2006 as it lost U.S. market share to Japan\\'s Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ). GM executives are also bracing for a possible proxy fight with billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, the automaker\\'s largest individual shareholder. Kerkorian\\'s financial adviser, Jerry York, quit GM\\'s board in October, after the automaker turned down a potential three-way alliance with Japan\\'s Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) and France\\'s Renault SA ( RENA.PA ). GM shares, which have risen nearly 80 percent so far this year, were up 8 cents at $34.78 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

       "  ' HORDAIN, France  (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) was set to reveal its new chief executive later on Tuesday as it unveiled a set of new utility vehicles developed with Italy\\'s Fiat ( FIA.MI ). \\n\\n PSA has been looking for a new CEO since announcing in September that Jean-Martin Folz would retire early in January. \"The supervisory board of PSA will meet this afternoon and will discuss the proposed candidate for CEO (Chief Executive Officer). The name of my successor will be announced later today as well as the date he will start in his job,\" outgoing CEO Folz told reporters. The French press has said possible candidates for the job included former Airbus CEO Christian Streiff; Jacques Aschenbroich, a managing director with construction group Saint Gobain ( SGOB.PA ); steelmaker Corus CS.L head Philippe Varin; the head of nuclear reactor maker Areva CEPFi.PA, Anne Lauvergeon; and PSA\\'s own strategy director, Gilles Michel. PSA has declined to comment on speculation regarding who might replace Folz. Folz also declined comment. PSA shares rose 0.8 percent by 1130 GMT. The stock has underperformed rival European carmakers since the start of 2006. Based on latest prices, PSA shares have fallen around 3.5 percent while the DJ Stoxx European automotive sector .SXAP has risen around 23 percent. \"Any new CEO at Peugeot is going to help the stock,\" said Credit Suisse analyst Harald Hendrikse, although he added it was unclear how much upside remained in PSA shares. PSA is battling with declining sales in its main western European markets and aims to accelerate sales in east Europe and China after four profit warnings in five quarters, while Fiat is returning to financial health after cost cuts following a 2001-2002 crisis that was the worst since its creation in 1899. The launch of their new utility vehicles on Tuesday showed that the two groups prefer limited partnerships over a big global alliance for their future. The new compact utility vehicles, which are no longer solely for small and medium-sized firms but increasingly tempt private buyers, build on 28 years of cooperation between the French and Italian firms at the Sevel Nord factory in northern France. Another 50/50 joint factory in Italy makes larger light commercial vehicles while the two makers also plan to produce cars with Turkey\\'s Tofas ( TOASO.IS ) in Bursa from 2008. The new compact utility vehicle versions -- Peugeot Expert, Citroen Jumpy and Fiat Scudo -- will be on sale in early 2007. With a loading space of seven cubic meters, the small vans will be sold at about 19,500 euros ($24,790). Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said he saw the automotive division selling more than 360,000 commercial vehicles in 2006. \"We will top 360,000 this year and aim to sell 400,000 in 2008, when we aim to boost market share to 12.5 percent,\" Marchionne told reporters. The companies jointly invested 440 million euros in the new vehicles, which will be made at a rate of 130,000 per year. NO BIG ALLIANCE PSA has several co-operation deals such as the ones with Fiat and Toyota, as well as with BMW ( BMWG.DE ), Ford ( F.N ) and Renault for engines and Mitsubishi Motors Corp ( 7211.T ) for the new C-Crosser and 4007 four-by-four sports utility vehicles. For Folz, these deals made more economic sense than a big alliance such as DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE or Renault-Nissan. Marchionne is also relying heavily on partnerships after his predecessors flirted with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) for an all-out tie-up that ended in a $2 billion settlement in 2005. That same year he signed a deal with Ford for a small car to replace the 500 and Ka models in 2007/08, based on the Panda platform and made in Poland and Italy. On Wednesday and Thursday, he will unveil the 2007-2010 strategy for the group to analysts, investors and journalists.

The new cars, developed for professionals, can also be used as so-called \"ludospace\" -- a combination of play and space -- for families able to carry up to nine people. \"These allow us to better respond to the demands of professionals and attract private buyers,\" he said. PLATFORM They are built on the same platform as the big multi-purpose vehicles Peugeot 807, Citroen C8, Fiat Ulysse and Lancia Phedra that are also produced at Sevel Nord, which employs 4,400 people. Since 1998, PSA has a platform policy which means that at least 60 percent of a vehicle should be made up of common parts -- the subframe, powertrain, transmission and chassis. The group has three platforms of its own and three cooperation platforms, of which two are with Fiat and one with Toyota for the very small Aygo, 107 and C1 cars made at Kolin in the Czech Republic. Shared platforms allow for lower costs per vehicle. In the specific market for light commercial vehicles, Volkswagen is the leader with its Transporter followed by the Renault Traffic. But in the larger commercial vehicle sector of up to 3.5 metric tons, PSA had a market share of 17.8 percent in western Europe in the eight months up to August, against Renault\\'s 14.6 percent, Fiat\\'s 13.3 percent and Volkswagen\\'s 10 percent.

       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. posted a better-than-expected 44 percent rise in quarterly operating profit as robust sales, cost cuts and a soft yen offset higher raw materials prices, and it lifted its full-year forecasts. \\n\\n Toyota has grown rapidly in the United States and Europe with popular fuel-efficient cars such as the Camry sedan and Yaris subcompact, as well as the gasoline/electric hybrid Prius, leaving big local brands struggling to defend market share. In a move that could further solidify its lead in advanced environmental technology, Toyota also announced an operational and capital tie-up with Japanese truck maker Isuzu Motors Ltd. to jointly develop diesel and other low-emission engines to meet increasingly tighter regulations around the world. Toyota will buy 100 million shares, or 5.9 percent, of Isuzu from trading houses Mitsubishi Corp. and Itochu Corp. as part of the agreement. With a market value of $215 billion, Toyota is worth almost as much as the next four top-ranked auto makers -- Honda Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler AG, Nissan Motor Co. and BMW AG -- combined. Toyota\\'s sales in the West have more than made up for sluggish demand in Japan, Indonesia and other parts of Asia. Reflecting that trend, Toyota adjusted its regional vehicle sales forecasts, expecting total demand at 8.47 million units this business year, up 20,000 from the previous projection. Toyota now expects a full-year operating profit of 2.2 trillion yen -- about the size of Albania\\'s economy -- and net profit of 1.55 trillion yen thanks to a softer-than-expected yen. Three months ago, it projected record group operating profit of 1.9 trillion yen and net profit of 1.31 trillion yen for the year to end-March. The revision had been expected after Toyota boosted its half-year parent-only projections last month. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates predict a full-year operating profit of 2.1 trillion yen and a net profit of 1.47 trillion yen. \"These are strong numbers,\" said Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments. \"Even next year and beyond we might be able to expect double-digit profit growth. It looks like they are the only game in town when it comes to the car business.\" Japan\\'s top auto maker is set to continue its seamless global product offensive with the big Tundra pickup in the United States -- its third crack at the all-American segment -- and other models such as the Auris compact in Europe. Based on current trends, Toyota is on track to overtake General Motors Corp. as the world\\'s top seller of automobiles within a year. POLE POSITION For the July-September second quarter, operating profit totaled 581 billion yen ($4.92 billion), outpacing an average estimate of 527.6 billion yen in a survey of six brokerages by Reuters Estimates. Net profit jumped 34 percent to 405.7 billion yen, against a market estimate for 372.5 billion yen. Despite its scale, Toyota\\'s profit growth was among the highest in Japan\\'s healthy auto sector. Honda booked a 19 percent rise in quarterly operating profit, while Nissan, lacking the boost of new product launches, saw profits dip. Big overseas rivals such as Ford Motor Co., GM and DaimlerChrysler, meanwhile, are faltering under sliding sales in the United States, the world\\'s biggest auto market. Toyota has outlined plans to win more drivers in the United States through its youth-oriented Scion brand and by beefing up its truck line-up. It hopes to grab more European buyers with a broader range of diesel-powered vehicles, while at home it is counting on the high-end Lexus brand to woo customers and lift traditionally low margins. \"We expect profits to improve in all regions in real terms,\" said Senior Managing Director Takeshi Suzuki. \"All in all, our dependence on North America for profits is steadily decreasing.\" Next year, Toyota is due to expand existing plants and build new factories in Russia, China and Thailand, increasing its global output capacity by at least 560,000 units. Toyota shares gained 7.2 percent in July-September, in line with the transport subindex\\'s 6.9 percent rise. The stock has since gained another 8 percent. In a potential negative for the shares, Toyota said a state-backed body would unload 43.4 million of its shares in a secondary offering worth about 308 billion yen ($2.6 billion.), or 1.2 percent of its outstanding stock. But it also announced plans to buy back up to 20 million of its own shares, or up to 150 billion yen worth, over two days from November 9 as part of a previously unveiled scheme to buy back up to 200 billion yen of its stock. Toyota raised its interim half-year dividend to 50 yen from 35 yen a year ago. Ahead of the results on Tuesday, Toyota shares ended up 1 percent at 7,100 yen, while the transport subindex closed 0.9 percent higher. ($1=118.04 Yen)',\n",
       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. said on Tuesday it would buy a 5.9 percent stake in Japanese truck maker Isuzu Motors Ltd. for 44 billion yen ($372.7 million) as part of a broad tie-up to develop low-emission diesel and other engines. \\n\\n The move comes as auto makers around the world race to come up with advanced technology to meet ever-tighter standards for emissions and fuel economy, with many forming operational alliances to sharpen their competitive edge. It also marks a recognition by Toyota, which has been trying to steer the industry toward gasoline-electric hybrids, that it urgently needs a broader line-up of diesel cars as consumers seek to get more mileage out of expensive fuel. Diesel cars are typically 20 to 30 percent more fuel-efficient than gasoline cars, although they emit more harmful nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. Rival Honda Motor Co. earlier this year announced plans to beef up its work on diesels, betting on growth in North America, Japan and other markets where they still occupy a niche. \"We consider hybrid technology as one effective solution, but in light of the varying regulations and energy policies in different countries, as well as the proliferation of fuel sources, we need stepped-up efforts in the diesel field,\" Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe said. \"That\\'s why we approached Isuzu with this proposition,\" he told a joint news conference in Tokyo. The latest step marks Toyota\\'s second capital link-up with a Japanese auto maker in 13 months. In October 2005, it took 8.7 percent of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the maker of Subaru cars. Both Fuji Heavy and diesel-savvy Isuzu, a 69-year-old truck maker valued at $4.0 billion, were formerly affiliated with U.S. auto giant General Motors Corp., which had dissolved those ties to raise much-needed cash. Toyota, the world\\'s second-biggest auto maker after GM, will buy 60 million shares in Tokyo-based Isuzu from Mitsubishi Corp. and 40 million from Itochu Corp., for 440 yen a share. The purchases are scheduled for November 10. The price would represent a 6 percent premium on Isuzu\\'s closing share price of 415 yen on Tuesday. Mitsubishi will remain Isuzu\\'s top shareholder with more than 9 percent, followed by Itochu with more than 7 percent, if all preferred shares purchased by Toyota are converted. POSITIVE MOVE Analysts cheered the tie-up. \"It\\'s positive for both sides,\" said UBS Securities auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida, saying the ties could hasten Toyota\\'s diesel efforts while enabling Isuzu to tap its partner\\'s experience with other advanced technology. \"It\\'s especially good for Isuzu -- being under Toyota\\'s umbrella will help as it tries to expand in emerging markets,\" he added. The tie-up will focus on development and production of small diesel engines, joint development of emission-reducing technology for diesel engines and other powertrain-related technologies. Watanabe and Isuzu counterpart Yoshinori Ida said they have yet to decide what shape the cooperation will take, including whether Isuzu will supply its existing engines to Toyota. Isuzu already supplies small diesel engines to GM and Renault SA, and until recently also to Honda. The partners will form a team within the month to work out details. Toyota sells most of its diesel passenger cars in Europe through the Yaris, Avensis, Corolla and RAV4. \"We want to broaden our diesel line-up and improve on the current technology,\" Watanabe said, adding he believed an equity participation would help to get results fast. Toyota, which announced rosy second-quarter results and lifted its full-year profit forecasts earlier, also holds stakes in Japanese truck maker Hino Motors Ltd., minivehicle maker Daihatsu Motor Co. and motorcycle maker Yamaha Motor Co.. Before the news, shares in Isuzu ended down 1.19 percent, while Toyota ended up 1 percent at 7,100 yen. The Japanese transport subindex closed 0.9 percent higher.

The Banks' Shareholdings Purchase Corp. is a state-backed entity set up in 2002 to buy shares from banks, which at the time were unloading their massive shareholdings in companies like Toyota, helping drive the stock market to a two-decade low.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Two bellwether U.S. homebuilders warned on Tuesday that the slowdown in the country\\'s once-soaring real estate market continued in the latest quarter as deteriorating consumer confidence and falling prices cast a growing pall over the sector. \\n\\n Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ) said it expects to report a 10 percent drop in quarterly home-building revenue, and warned of continuing softness in formerly hot markets such as Northern California and parts of Florida. The company also said it expects to take fourth-quarter write-downs of $50 million to $100 million on both the land it owns and has options to buy, up from a prior forecast of $4 million. The charges will reduce net earnings by 18 cents to 36 cents per share. Meanwhile, Toll Brothers\\' smaller rival Beazer Homes USA Inc. ( BZH.N ), which builds houses largely for first-time buyers, posted a 44-percent decline in quarterly earnings and forecast profit sharply below expectations for its 2007 fiscal year. Though the reports showed weakness at both extremes of the market, neither was unexpected, coming on top of a series of government and industry reports that showed America\\'s long housing boom has corrected. New home sales and prices are both sharply below year-ago levels, as rising interest rates and steep energy prices dampen consumer spending. As a result, neither company\\'s shares suffered much in Tuesday trading. Toll Brothers\\' stock fell as much as 2 percent in early trading but later recovered and was close to unchanged, a sign investors had already factored in weakness. Beazer\\'s shares, meanwhile, actually edged higher as results were not as weak as Wall Street had expected. While Toll\\'s write-offs were larger than the market expected, John Tomlinson, an analyst at Majestic Research, said the move made sense. \"They (Toll Brothers) just don\\'t want to exercise all these options on land contracts if demand is so weak at the high end of the market,\" he said. Tomlinson said 92 percent of the local U.S. markets that Majestic reviewed showed negative year-over-year order trends in September. CONFIDENCE WANES Toll Brothers\\' chief executive said the economic trends are leading customers -- even those in the high income bracket that his company serves -- to take a wait-and-see approach. \"We believe weak buyer confidence is keeping many customers on the sidelines,\" the CEO, Robert Toll, said in a statement. \"We continue to look for signs that a recovery is imminent, but can\\'t yet say that one is in sight.\" Preliminary numbers show the company posted home-building revenue of $1.81 billion for the fourth quarter ended October 31. Analysts, on average, were expecting $1.87 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Toll Brothers said quarterly total contracts suffered from a higher-than-normal 585 cancellations, one-fourth of which came in the Orlando and Northern California markets. The company lowered its land position by around 6,500 lots, ending the quarter with around 74,000 lots owned or controlled, a decline of 19 percent. \"Given falling home prices, we believe it is necessary and prudent for the builders to keep trimming more recent lot positions,\" UBS analyst Margaret Whelan said in a note to investors. Toll Brothers said it expected to deliver between 6,300 and 7,300 homes for fiscal 2007, compared with its previous forecast of 7,000 to 8,000. The company expects to deliver between 1,500 and 1,800 homes in the current first quarter. The Horsham, Pennsylvania company is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter financial results on December 5 and did not update its previous forecast of earnings of $1.33 to $1.53 per share.

The 5th Circuit online docket confirmed the ruling. Russell P. Butler, who said he lost $8,000 in the collapse of Enron, had filed a petition asking the 5th Circuit to overturn a decision by the trial judge dropping Lay\\'s case after he died July 5 while awaiting sentencing. Butler argued that U.S. District Judge Sim Lake\\'s ruling denied him his right to restitution from the Lay estate, as provided by the federal Crime Victims Rights Act of 2004. The panel cited a prior case that \"firmly and unequivocally established ... that when a defendant who has been found guilty of a federal crime dies before exhaustion of his appeal, his prosecution must be abated, his conviction vacated and his indictment dismissed.\" A jury convicted Lay last May of conspiracy and fraud contributing to the 2001 collapse of Enron, which was once one of the nation\\'s largest energy companies.

He added: \"In terms of dealing with global imbalances in a steady and orderly fashion, a strengthening Japanese economy is good news for the world.\" Balls declined to comment on currencies when asked about the yen\\'s fall against the euro and sterling and concerns among some European officials about the yen weakness. But he noted that putting external pressure on currency policy would hinder Japan\\'s policy making process. \"Part of the reason why there has been past difficulties in the economic policy here have been because of external pressure on exchange rates, which then led to not getting the internal macroeconomic policy mix right.\" \"I would expect Japanese authorities to be very focused on domestic stability and growth in the coming months and that would be quite wise.\" Sterling has been extending its recent gains against the yen, hitting 224.61 yen GBPJPY=R on Monday, its highest since October 1998.

( DF.N ) on Tuesday lowered the top end of its full-year earnings outlook, forecast next year\\'s profit growth below Wall Street estimates and said it found administrative errors in stock options grants in 1997 and 2000, sending shares down 5 percent. \\n\\n The news came as the No. 1 U.S. dairy company reported quarterly earnings in line with Wall Street expectations. Dean, which last week said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an informal inquiry into its stock options practices, took a noncash charge of about $500,000 in the latest quarter related to the options, but said it will not have to restate any historical results. Dean is one of more than 150 companies that have launched internal reviews or are subject to SEC probes to determine whether the dates of stock options were manipulated. The company, whose products include Silk Soymilk and Horizon Organic milk, said it revised its 2006 forecast in part due to costs associated with the options inquiry and investments in its business. The company said it now saw 2006 earnings of $2.10 to $2.12 per share, compared with its prior forecast of $2.10 to $2.15. For 2007, it expects earnings per share growth before items in the range of 11 percent to 13 percent. J.P. Morgan analyst Pablo Zuanic said those forecasts implied fourth-quarter earnings of 59 cents to 61 cents per share, and 2007 earnings of $2.34 to $2.38 per share, which are both shy of Wall Street\\'s consensus estimates. Zuanic rates Dean shares \"overweight.\" Analysts were looking for profit of 63 cents per share for the fourth quarter and $2.40 for 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said third-quarter income from continuing operations had risen to $74.5 million, or 54 cents per share, from $62.2 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the Dallas-based company earned 56 cents, meeting Wall Street expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales fell 2 percent to $2.5 billion, hurt by a planned reduction in the range of products sold and lower dairy prices, as the company passed on savings from lower costs for raw milk and butter. But the company\\'s dairy unit sold 1.3 percent more milk by volume, a measure that excludes currency and price fluctuations, and saw its operating income and margins boosted by the lower costs, operating efficiencies, and the favorable settlement of a dispute with a supplier. Operating margins in its WhiteWave organic food and soy milk unit were hurt by higher costs for organic milk, sugar and fuel and higher information technology investments. Some analysts have been concerned about whether the supply of organic milk can meet growing demand, since Dean limited supplies to retailers earlier this year. Chief Executive Gregg Engles told analysts the forecast of 20 percent growth in 2007 sales of Horizon brand organic milk was based on the company\\'s business plans and a pipeline of new supply. Dean shares, which had gained 12 percent this year, were down $2.26 at $39.89, or 5.36 percent, in mid-day trade on the New York Stock Exchange.',\n",

SLE.N on Tuesday said quarterly profit rose nearly fivefold, helped by a $158 million tax benefit and stronger sales, and its stock edged up 1 percent. \\n\\n The maker of Sara Lee bread and Best Kosher hot dogs also raised its profit forecast for the full year because of lower interest expense. Sara Lee posted net income of $333 million, or 44 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, up from $67 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings in the latest period include about nine weeks of results from Hanesbrands Inc. ( HBI.N ), which was spun off on September 5. The spinoff was the last major step in a 19-month overhaul of Sara Lee's portfolio that saw the company divest businesses to focus on coffee and tea, U.S. deli meats and baked goods, and European household products. Excluding results from Hanesbrands, earnings per share from continuing operations rose to 34 cents from 13 cents. Quarterly sales rose 5 percent to $2.9 billion. The company posted sales growth in all of its business segments for the first time in two years, helped by strong demand for new products such as a bacon variety of Jimmy Dean Breakfast Skillets, and price increases in its bakery division to cover rising wheat costs. Looking ahead, the company raised its full-year profit forecast to a range of 86 cents to 92 cents per share. In August it forecast 80 cents to 88 cents. Analysts, on average, expected 81 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sara Lee shares were up 16 cents at $16.40 in early New York Stock Exchange trading.

( 005930.KS ), the world\\'s third-largest mobile phone maker, expects the global handset market to grow 10 percent next year as analysts expect China and India to lead the expansion. \\n\\n Samsung also raised its forecast for 2006 to 970 million from 950 million, Lee Ki-tae, president of Samsung\\'s telecommunication network business, said on the sidelines of a news conference on Tuesday. \"Global handset sales are now expected at 970 million, thanks to the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China) market,\" Lee said when asked by Reuters about the latest sales forecast. Samsung previously forecast 950 million units of 2006 shipments. \"Next year, it could reach 1.07 billion,\" Lee said, without elaborating. The forecast indicates the market growth would halve in 2007 from about 20 percent growth estimated for this year. Lee\\'s comments came after Citigroup raised its forecast for 2006 global mobile phone shipments by 1 percent to 968 million units, citing stronger-than-expected growth in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Citigroup also predicted that shipments would reach 1.04 billion units in 2007, with the Asian handset market continuing to grow at a fast pace. Shipment growth in China could accelerate next year once next-generation mobile service begins there, it said. India could show the best unit growth globally on subscription growth and handset replacements. Samsung, which trails Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and Motorola Inc. MOT.N, is trying to regain market share with additional stylish slim phones, as well as advanced mobile devices featuring new technologies such as high-speed wireless Internet. In Tuesday\\'s news conference, Samsung introduced a new PDA-based device capable of voice and multimedia communication through wireless broadband service. Samsung\\'s market share has been stagnant this year while rivals cashed in on ultra-thin phones in advanced markets or cheap models in emerging markets. Samsung sold record 30.7 million mobile phones in the third quarter thanks to strong sales of a new series of slim phones, but its market share stood at 12 percent, a tad higher from 11.2 percent in the previous quarter but lower than 12.8 percent from a year earlier, according to Strategy Analytics.',\n",
       "  ' HONG KONG  (Reuters) - McDonald\\'s Corp. ( MCD.N ) is not satisfied with how its fast-food restaurants are performing in China but is content to grow slower there than it has elsewhere, the head of the company\\'s Asia unit said on Tuesday. \\n\\n \"I\\'m not into a numbers game. We did that years ago ...\\'build it and they\\'ll come\\',\" Tim Fenton, president of McDonald\\'s Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit, told reporters at a media event in Hong Kong. \"I\\'m about getting it right, because that\\'s a decision that will last 20 years.\" McDonald\\'s has about 770 restaurants in China, ranking it as the second-largest restaurant chain behind KFC, the fried chicken unit of Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ), which has more than 1,700 outlets there. KFC\\'s rapid growth has been spurred in part by Chinese consumers\\' affinity for chicken. Fenton has been at the helm of McDonald\\'s Asia business since early last year and has started to turn around the company\\'s restaurants in China after struggling with deep discounting that hurt profits and sales. After posting slightly negative sales at restaurants open at least 13 months in 2005, McDonald\\'s same-store sales in China are up slightly less than 2 percent so far in 2006, Fenton said. He attributed that improvement to having more locations that are open 24 hours, the addition of a higher-priced Quarter Pounder to the company\\'s menu in China, and a more centralized marketing effort. Still, Fenton said he\\'s not satisfied. \"I\\'m not totally happy with our business model,\" he said, adding that the chain is content to add about 100 restaurants a year in China \"for the foreseeable future.\" That\\'s significantly fewer than KFC, which opens a new location in mainland China every day, on average. Still, McDonald\\'s is banking on substantial growth in China over the long term. Its supplier network is currently bigger than its demand, Fenton said. He outlined several initiatives aimed at driving sales growth, such as adding drive-thrus and expanding its breakfast menu. Drive-thrus are known to gain sales momentum the longer they are in existence, Fenton said, and should benefit same-store sales in China as car ownership in that market continues to increase. More than half McDonald\\'s new restaurants in China will be drive-thrus, he said. Breakfast, which the company is expanding from 350 restaurants to all its Chinese restaurants next year, is also expected to help sales, but not immediately. \"We know breakfast is not an overnight sensation,\" Fenton said. \"I\\'m thinking three to 10 years.\" About 38 percent of Chinese consumers eat breakfast outside the home, and that number is growing, Fenton said, noting that breakfast sales currently account for 4-6 percent of total sales at McDonald\\'s restaurants in China that currently serve breakfast. Delivery is another initiative McDonald\\'s is weighing in China, Fenton said. Delivery service has served the chain well in other markets, he said, adding that it accounts for about 27 percent of sales in Egypt.',\n",
       "  \" (Reuters) - Following are some key facts about major U.S. restaurant chains in China: \\n\\n -- McDonald's ( MCD.N ): America's largest fast-food restaurant chain entered mainland China in 1990 with its first outlet in the southern city of Shenzen. Of 30,000 outlets worldwide, McDonald's has some 770 restaurants in 120 cities in China and expects to reach 1,000 outlets by the time Beijing hosts the Olympics in August 2008. Expanding car ownership in China has put drive-thru restaurants at the core of McDonald's growth strategy, and they could account for more than half of new outlets. Revenues from the Asia-Pacific, Middle-East and Africa division, which includes China, rose 9 percent in July-September, to $804.7 million. Australia, China and Japan contribute about 50 percent of the region's revenues. -- Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ): The operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell is by far the biggest U.S. restaurant chain in China, with 1,700 KFC restaurants and 261 Pizza Huts. Yum's China division, which includes Thailand and KFC Taiwan in addition to mainland China, makes up nearly a third of the company's operating profit. In 2005, the division opened 375 new restaurants in mainland China, making it the largest restaurant company in the country, with over $1.2 billion in revenue and more than $200 million in operating profit. Yum's third-quarter operating profit in its China division jumped 26 percent to $105 million, while sales rose 28 percent to $445 million. In the U.S., where Yum has 20,000 restaurants, operating profits rose less than 1 percent, to $183 million, while sales fell 7 percent, to $1.3 billion. Yum opened its first KFC in Beijing in 1987, and on average opens a new restaurant in China every day. Yum estimates that roughly three out of four Chinese ate at KFC at least once in 2004, and that number should have grown further this year. Based in Louisville, Kentucky, it operates more than 34,000 fast-food restaurants in more than 100 countries. -- Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ): Starbucks expects China, where it has more than 400 stores, to one day be its biggest market outside the United States. CFO Michael Casey said in August the company could expand the number of its stores by five to 10 times. Beyond saying the China business is profitable, however, the company has laid out few financial details. Starbucks, which currently has more than 12,000 stores, including 8,800 in the United States, entered China in 1999 with a store in Beijing. Source: Reuters\",\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Emerson Electric Co. ( EMR.N ) on Tuesday reported a 26 percent increase in quarterly earnings on strong global demand and said it expected a double-digit profit increase in 2007. \\n\\n The company, whose products range from power systems and heating and cooling units to storage products and hand tools, said many of its markets remain strong, but growth rates are expected to moderate from their 2006 pace. It also raised its dividend and announced a stock split. Emerson shares rose $5.24, or 6.4 percent, to $87.80 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, touching their highest level in six months. The company earned $526 million, or $1.29 per share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with $419 million, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain related to the sale of a business, the company posted a profit of $1.24 a share, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $1.20 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 19 percent to $5.52 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts for $5.27 billion. Sales from existing businesses contributed 11 points of the sales growth, with recent acquisitions and exchange rates adding the rest. Demand for Emerson industrial automation and network power systems reflects a strong manufacturing economy worldwide, with high factory use rates and durable goods orders, FTN Midwest Securities analyst John Baliotti said. \"Customers have maintained current production levels at their plants if not increased them,\" he said. \"That would drive further demand for automation and probably provide good pricing.\" RECORD-SETTING Emerson has posted a series of record earnings in recent quarters, driven by worldwide investment in manufacturing and energy infrastructure, while realizing the benefits of past cost cutting. For the full year 2006, four of Emerson\\'s five divisions reported double-digit sales increases and three out of five showed improved profit margins, the company said. Profit margins were lower in Emerson\\'s appliance and tools segment and in its network power division. Looking ahead, Emerson expects underlying sales growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates, of 5 percent to 7 percent in its 2007 fiscal year, and total sales growth of 7 percent to 11 percent. It expects earnings in 2007 to grow by 12 percent to 15 percent from 2006 earnings of $4.48 per share. It said first-quarter comparisons would be affected by unusually low expenses and strong climate technologies sales in the year-ago first quarter. Analysts on average expect 2007 sales to increase 7 percent to $21.59 billion and estimate earnings per share will be up 12 percent to $5.02, according to Reuters Estimates. Emerson\\'s estimates may prove too low, FTN\\'s Baliotti said. \"I think the outlook is a good start. We know it to be a conservative company.\" A key question now is whether the most recent quarter\\'s drivers are in place for the longer term, Baliotti said. \"I want to know how much of this we can extrapolate into future periods,\" he said. Emerson\\'s earnings conference call is set for after Tuesday\\'s market close. Emerson\\'s board also approved an 18-percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 52.5 cents per share, and a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. Both dividends are payable on December 11 to shareholders of record on November 17, with the cash dividend paid on a pre-split basis.',\n",

Revlon, controlled by financier Ronald Perelman, said its third-quarter loss widened to $100.5 million, or 24 cents per share, from $65.4 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. It was the company's third quarterly loss in a row. Analysts on average expected New York-based Revlon to post a loss of 33 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil slid nearly 2 percent to below $59 a barrel on Tuesday as OPEC members differed on whether the producer group\\'s recent output cut agreement was enough to stabilize the market. \\n\\n U.S. crude CLc1 settled down $1.09, or 1.8 percent, at $58.93 a barrel. London Brent LCOc1 gave up $1.27 to settle at $58.48. The weakness came after Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Jarrah al-Sabah said OPEC\\'s deal to cut supplies had successfully balanced the market -- a sign that he may not support a further cut when OPEC meets in December. \"The Kuwaitis are basically somewhat contradicting the Saudi comments yesterday, saying they see the market a little more balanced,\" said Tom Bentz of BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. Prices had risen 88 cents on Monday after Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would take action when it meets on December 14, if world markets remain unbalanced. Naimi, oil minister of the world\\'s top exporter, noted \"very high\" global fuel stockpiles. OPEC last month agreed to trim output by 1.2 million barrels per day to help stop a 25 percent fall in oil prices since mid-July. Other Gulf OPEC ministers agreed that the group may need to cut further in December, while Iran said OPEC would not need to cut if prices stabilize. \"If the market is still unbalanced we will make another cut, but I cannot predict now what the quantity will be. The market is still unbalanced,\" Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah said. The U.S. Energy Information Administration on Tuesday said it expected the producer group to implement only about 745,000 bpd of the 1.2 million bpd in pledged cuts. Traders said the news flow was keeping prices in a range between $59 and $60. \"When it\\'s above $60, it\\'s sold into. It\\'s quite well supported by the prospect of OPEC cuts when it gets below $59,\" said Christopher Bellew of Bache Financial brokerage. INVENTORIES U.S. oil prices have fallen from a mid-July peak of $78.40, undermined by hefty stockpiles. Inventory data from the United States, to be released on Wednesday, was likely to show crude stockpiles rose by a modest 700,000 barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll of industry analysts showed. <EIA/S> Adding support to oil prices, militants and villagers invaded an oil production facility in Nigeria on Monday. Agip, a unit of Milan-based ENI ( ENI.MI ), said it had halted 50,000 bpd of production from the flow station at Tebidaba, the latest target in a wave of attacks against the oil industry in Nigeria. <ID:  Over the longer term, many analysts say, the risk remains of ever higher prices. In its annual World Energy Outlook on Tuesday, the International Energy Agency warned prices would be driven higher in the coming decades because investment is lagging demand.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - EchoStar Communications Corp. ( DISH.O ), the No. 2 U.S. satellite television provider, on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected subscriber growth in the third quarter, sending shares up 2 percent. \\n\\n While profit fell due to higher costs for servicing a bigger subscriber base, revenue topped the average forecast from analysts, who had expected much slower subscriber growth in the face of competition from cable TV providers. EchoStar said it added 295,000 subscribers to its DISH network in the quarter, up from 255,000 a year earlier. It now has 12.8 million subscribers. According to Cowen & Co., analysts on average forecast a slowdown in subscriber additions to 214,000. Analysts have said growth appeared to be running out of steam at EchoStar and its larger rival DirecTV Group Inc. DTV.N as cable companies win subscribers by bundling television, high-speed Internet and telephone service in competitively priced packages. The two satellite TV providers are benefiting from changes in the TV distribution sector, in particular, winning customers from bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications Corp. ADELQ.PK, whose subscribers are currently being migrated to cable operators Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) and Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ), said Oppenheimer analyst Thomas Eagan. \"We still think that cable will end up growing subscribers this year for the first time in many years, but satellite companies will add 1.7 million subscribers,\" said Eagan. EchoStar said third-quarter revenue rose 16 percent to $2.47 billion, topping analysts\\' average forecast of $2.44 billion as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter net income fell to $140 million, or 31 cents per share, from $209 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 35 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. EchoStar closed up 2 percent at $35.98, after hitting a session high of $37.28 on the Nasdaq. DirecTV shares fell 2.7 percent to $21.84 on the New York Stock Exchange. EchoStar shares have risen by around 12 percent and DirecTV shares have risen around 30 percent since mid-July on reports the two companies might merge. Previous merger talks failed to pass muster with government regulators in 2002. EchoStar Chief Executive Charlie Ergen, who has a controlling stake in the company, said on a conference call that he and the board would look at any \"compelling\" opportunities in the market, when asked about DirecTV. Investor speculation about a potential merger has been further complicated by reports that Liberty Media\\'s John Malone was in discussions with Rupert Murdoch about News Corp.\\'s NWSa.N stake in DirecTV. When asked about Malone\\'s interest in DirecTV, Ergen said, \"It\\'s a slight positive for us because it creates anxiety in management at DirecTV.\" But ultimately, he said he did not see any advantages one way or the other. EchoStar said subscriber-related expenses rose 22.3 percent to $1.22 billion. It attributed the rise to lower programming margins, higher maintenance costs for satellite receivers and a rise in customer service costs due to subscriber growth. It said subscriber-related expenses rose to 51.4 percent of subscriber-related revenue, from 49.6 percent a year earlier. Average revenue per customer rose to $62.86 per month in the third quarter, from $57.87 a year earlier. The average spent to acquire each new subscriber fell to $688 from $697.',\n",

       "  ' by Robert MacMillan \\n\\n NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Playboy Enterprises Inc. PLA.N on Tuesday reported lower quarterly profit, but shares rose more than 9 percent as the company overturned Wall Street expectations of a loss. Lower revenue at the adult entertainment company\\'s namesake magazine and higher expenses in other divisions contributed to the fall in net income. But a strong performance for Playboy\\'s digital media and licensing businesses helped the company avoid a loss and bolstered its strategy to build up its brand across media and other product lines. The company also said it expects advertising sales to rise at the magazine and Web site during the fourth quarter, thanks to increased entertainment and fashion advertising. \"We\\'re pleased because this has been a challenging year for the men\\'s (advertising) market,\" Chief Executive Christie Hefner told Reuters in an interview. Third-quarter net income fell to $1.1 million or 3 cents a share from $3.2 million, or 10 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue rose 2 percent to $82.3 million. Analysts on average had forecast a loss of 3 cents per share on revenue of $79.1 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Playboy, like other magazine publishers, is fighting lower advertising and newsstand revenue as more readers migrate to the Internet and other media. The Chicago-based company has taken several steps to improve performance, including an increased Web presence and placing its famous \"Bunny\" logo on all manner of clothing and accessories. PLAYBOY ON THE GO Playboy\\'s global licensing profit rose 41 percent to $4.6 million while online subscriptions and purchases revenue grew to $12.6 million from $9 million a year before. But revenue was weak in its U.S. television division and publishing, while corporate expenses rose 31 percent. The company said it is maintaining its forecast of 2006 earnings per share at 5 cents to 10 cents. Playboy also is looking abroad to expand its consumer brand reach and its Playboy clubs, following the opening in October of a club at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. It hopes to open similar themed venues in London and Macau and could explore other countries such as India, Hefner said. \"I certainly think that the more pluralistic, secular societies of countries like Turkey that have pretty vibrant economies would be of interest to us,\" she said. The debut of Playboy\\'s Indonesian edition sparked protests from Islamic groups and attacks on the publisher\\'s office in Jakarta after it launched in April. The magazine is now in its fifth edition there. \"We seem to have worked through it,\" Hefner said. Brazil is another possibility for the company\\'s consumer products, she added. \"The culture is a perfect fit with Playboy.\" Playboy shares were up 90 cents, or 8.7 percent, to $11.36 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Third quarter revenue rose 14 percent to $93.7 million from $82.2 million in the year-ago period. Excluding the Microsoft settlement, stock-based compensation costs equity investment gains and other costs, the company made a profit of $8.7 million, or 5 cents per share. Those payments from Microsoft will continue through the first quarter of 2007, RealNetworks Chief Executive Rob Glaser told Reuters on Monday. In the meantime, the two companies are working together to sell RealNetworks\\' online music and games, Glaser said. \"With regard to the state of relationship, it is steady,\" he said. \"We are working together well.\" Analysts, on average, expected net income of 22 cents per share and revenue of $92.8 million for the third quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. The company saw a 53 percent increase in revenue from games sales and a 16 percent rise in music revenue over last year\\'s third quarter, while media software and services sales fell 4 percent over the same period. For the fourth quarter, RealNetworks expects revenue of between $117 million and $123 million, and net earnings of 18 cents to 21 cents per share. It forecast 2006 revenue of between $387 million and $393 million, with net earnings per share of 77 cents to 80 cents. Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast fourth- quarter net earnings of 22 cents per share and revenue of $99.34 million, and full-year earnings of 80 cents on revenue of $368.2 million.

       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) on Tuesday posted flat third-quarter sales growth, slightly below forecast, as poor trading at its SFR mobile unit and music business dented solid revenues from video games and Maroc Telecom ( IAM.PA ). \\n\\n Its shares sagged as Vivendi declined to elaborate on a failed friendly takeover approach by U.S. private equity firm KKR, and as it stopped short of updating its full year outlook. The French telecoms and media group, which owns the world\\'s biggest record company Universal Music Group, reported sales for the three months to September 30 of 4.889 billion euros ($6.22 billion). This lagged the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 10 analysts for 4.948 billion euros. Vivendi had at the weekend confirmed press reports of the KKR takeover approach, but noted then that talks had not led to an offer. \"We think that these results will disappoint and on top of the weekend\\'s news of KKR\\'s having ended bid talks with Vivendi we think it is increasingly difficult to see great upside in the near term,\" Cazenove wrote in a note. The shares fell as much as 3.10 percent on Tuesday, and were down 2.83 percent at 29.18 euros by 1040 GMT. Vivendi shares have gained 13 percent in the past three months, driven by takeover speculation and improved sentiment toward the telecoms sector. There has been market speculation that Vivendi initiated the talks with KKR to show that a buyout would be difficult to achieve and so bury the matter, at least for some time. No-one at Vivendi wished to comment on Tuesday. \"We believe that:...Vivendi wanted to demonstrate that a takeover may be difficult to execute (either thorough a hostile or friendly bid),\" Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Monday. In May, investment fund Sebastian Holdings informally approached Vivendi about breaking it up, lifting the share price and the value of its then less than 5 percent holding in the media and telecoms group. Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy has since said several times he was against a dismantling of the group. SFR, MUSIC LET-DOWN Sales from SFR, France\\'s second largest mobile operator, fell 1.8 percent to 2.196 billion euros in the third quarter, undershooting an average forecast from six analysts for 2.242 billion euros. Vivendi said the decline had been caused largely by lower prices imposed by the telecoms regulator. Vivendi blamed unfavorable exchange rates for a 2.1 percent drop in revenues at Universal Music Group to 1.096 billion euros. Once stripped of a 36 million euro boost from a litigation settlement with the file-sharing web site Napster, music revenue numbers came in below an average forecast of 1.089 billion euros in a Reuters poll of six analysts. On a brighter note, digital music sales -- music that can be downloaded from the Internet to computers and mobile phones -- continued to rise, climbing 88 percent in the third quarter and now making up 11.5 percent of UMG\\'s total revenues. The growth of digital music sales is helping, albeit insufficiently, the global record market battered by unrelenting Internet-based piracy. Sales from the video games division rose 15.2 percent year on year to 182 million euros. Meanwhile, like-for-like sales from the pay-TV unit Canal Plus rose 4.6 percent to 879 million euros and revenues, already published, from Maroc Telecom rose 12.6 percent. Overall, total year-on-year sales grew 0.3 percent in the third quarter, from 4.874 billion euros published a year earlier, and compared with 4.850 billion in 2005 adjusted for acquisitions and disposals. SPECULATION TO PERSIST? The shares are trading on a prospective price to earnings ratio of 13 times for 2007, which puts them at a discount to other European groups such as Pearson ( PSON.L ) on 17 times but a premium to French media group Lagardere ( LAGA.PA ) on 12 times. Since the start of the year, Vivendi shares have underperformed the media sector index .SXMP by 18.5 percent, the telecoms index .SXKP by 23.3 percent and the CAC-40 index of blue chips  .FCHI  by 25 percent. KKR\\'s informal approach, unlike Sebastian\\'s, would have preserved the group\\'s existing structure, Vivendi said on Saturday. However, some analysts argue the group would still be worth more broken up. \"We continue to believe that unless the company defines a consistent strategy, speculation will continue to swirl around Vivendi,\" French brokerage Natexis Bleichroeder wrote in a note.',\n",

Yell\\'s UK revenue increased 3 percent to 351.6 million pounds, driven entirely by growth from Yell.com which made up for a weaker performance from its UK printed directories which were down 2.7 percent at 297.1 million pounds due to competition. Total U.S. revenue grew 23 percent to 455 million pounds or 26.4 percent at a constant exchange rate. This included revenue from directories publishing for the first time, mainly from the acquisition of Transwestern which was completed in July 2005, of 105.8 million pounds. The company\\'s H1 results also included a first-time contribution from Spanish directory firm TPI which Yell acquired on July 31 as two months of consolidation. Yell said it had consolidated less than 10 percent of the annual revenue owing to the low number of directories distributed in the summer months. TPI revenue during the two months was 42.2 million pounds. The company raised the interim dividend 11.8 percent to 5.7 pence per share.',\n",

Apple has upgraded its iTunes online music store for video and services like YouTube have attracted world-wide attention. Microsoft will begin on November 22 to offer standard and high-definition films such as Warner Bros.\\' \"Superman Returns\" and \"Jackass: The Movie\" from Paramount Pictures through its Xbox Live Marketplace. Television shows will include Viacom Inc\\'s \"South Park\" and \"CSI: NY\" from CBS Corp.. Viewers will need the current-generation Xbox 360 console with a hard drive to take advantage of the service. Earlier this year, Amazon.com announced it would sell movies for download at its online store, while Apple already sells music, videos and games for its iPod devices. Apple also is planning a 2007 launch for its iTV, which will allow users to watch downloaded movies and television episodes from iTunes on the television. DVD rental service Netflix Inc., which currently sends movies through the mail, also aims eventually to allow movie downloads. Microsoft customers have a two week window from when they download a movie to watch it, but once they begin watching it they have only 24 hours to keep it. Television shows, on the other hand, will be sold for purchase through Xbox Live. Microsoft expects to offer 1,000-plus hours of video content through Xbox Live by the end of 2006. \"This is a first step,\" said  Scott Henson, director of platform strategy at Microsoft. He declined to give pricing information for the service. Microsoft has 4 million subscribers on Xbox Live, where video gamers can chat, compete and collect status-building gamer points, although some subscribers have the original version of Xbox which does not work with the new video download service. Xbox Live Marketplace currently offers movie trailers and a handful of music videos and other content. Microsoft already partners with Movielink, a service that lets people download films to their personal computers. Microsoft also is taking aim at Apple\\'s lead position in mobile music with the launch of its Zune music player next week. The software maker\\'s Zune Marketplace, which targets Apple\\'s iTunes service, also will sell songs for about 99 cents each. Zune users will be able to stream photos, music and videos from the player to the Xbox 360, Henson said. Sony Corp\\'s new PlayStation 3 debuts on November 17 with an online game service called the PlayStation Network, which also will allow users to view video downloads. Sony is the video game console market leader and its next-generation PS3 is a direct Xbox 360 competitor. (Additional reporting by Dai Wakabayashi)',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.\\'s ability to convert occasional players of online video games into regular gamers is key to growth for the next-generation Xbox 360 console, a company executive said on Tuesday. \\n\\n He was speaking at a conference a day after the software giant announced the debut of a video download service for its Xbox Live online service that will make some television shows and movies available in high definition video by November 22. \"The real growth here is getting to that moderate gamer. We need to bring them to the box,\" Peter Moore, vice president of Microsoft\\'s entertainment and devices division which oversees Xbox, told investors at the BMO Capital Markets conference in New York. Moore was referring to users who occasionally play video games online but have yet to spend at least $400 to buy the Xbox for their homes. Microsoft\\'s new video service, which will start initially offering about 1,000 hours of movies to rent and shows to buy, is designed to keep existing Xbox customers glued to the screen and places the video game machine at the center of the living room media hub. Moore told Reuters in an interview that it was likely the service would announce more programming partners, but he did not give any further details. \"I guarantee you that if I had three more weeks (before announcing the launch), I would have 15 logos up there,\" Moore added, referring to the logos of programming companies that have struck video deals with Xbox. They currently include Time Warner Inc.\\'s Warner Bros. movie studios and Viacom Inc.\\'s MTV Networks. The service is designed to play up the lifestyle aspects of owning a game console, which mainly appeals to gamers seeking better graphics and more in-depth games. Although videos purchased or rented on the service will not immediately be viewable on Microsoft\\'s upcoming Zune portable media player, Moore told Reuters that Microsoft had not ruled that out. \"Zune -- that is in the future,\" he said, adding that there were no immediate plans. Microsoft\\'s Zune, which hits store shelves next week, is designed to compete against Apple Computer Inc.\\'s popular iPod music and video player. Moore said Microsoft\\'s head-start in connecting video game consoles to online gaming through its Xbox Live service should prove an advantage in tapping future growth. He cited data from tracking firm DFC Intelligence that forecast the number of video game consoles connected to the Internet to quadruple by 2010. Console-connected online gaming services are opening up new revenue streams, such as advertising and additional content sales for device makers and video game publishers. Microsoft has 4 million Xbox Live subscribers, who can download game demos, chat and compete with friends, buy new maps and weapons and, soon, download TV shows and movies. Rival Sony Corp. said 3 million of the 106 million PlayStation 2 owners use its online service. The company is revamping the service, called PlayStation Network, for its PlayStation 3 console that makes its U.S. debut on November 17. Moore confirmed Microsoft\\'s expectation that Xbox 360 shipments would reach 10 million by the end of 2006, and 13 million to 15 million by the end of its 2007 fiscal year.

Total revenue fell 1.5 percent to $2.1 billion from $2.2 billion a year earlier. Admissions from continuing operations declined 3.3 percent, exacerbated by tighter Medicare requirements. Admissions from private insurers fell 6.3 percent. Hospitals are being hurt by a rise in the number of patients without health insurance. Tenet is also recovering from a series of government probes into charges it inflated Medicare billing. In June, Tenet reached a $900 million deal with the Justice Department to settle charges it bilked Medicare, the federal program for about 43 million elderly and disabled. That probe and several lawsuits related to patient care led many doctors to flee the company, further pressuring patient admission volume. Tenet shares are down 10 percent this year, compared with the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Provider Index .RXH, which is down about 3.6 percent.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - European plane maker Airbus ( EAD.PA ), which has faced a series of production delays on its high-profile A380 superjumbo program, suffered a major blow on Tuesday when FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ) canceled a roughly $2.5 billion order and switched to rival Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) \\n\\n FedEx Express, the express package delivery unit of U.S. shipping company FedEx, became the first customer to terminate an order for Airbus\\' flagship plane when it scrapped an agreement to buy 10 A380-800F aircraft. Instead, FedEx ordered 15 Boeing 777 Freighter aircraft and took options to purchase 15 more. The previous agreement with Airbus included an option for another 10 A380 planes, a FedEx spokesman said, but those options are now invalid. FedEx said it expects to take delivery of four Boeing 777s in 2009, eight in 2010 and the remainder in 2011. At a list price of $232.5 million to $240 million each, the order will be worth at least $3.48 billion to Boeing. The Boeing 777 Freighter, launched in May 2005, is the world\\'s largest twin-engine cargo aircraft, but smaller than Boeing\\'s new four-engined 747-8F Freighter. The cancellation is a further blow to Airbus and its majority parent, EADS ( EAD.PA ), which have been plunged into financial and political crisis after a string of wiring delays on the A380 pushed the world\\'s largest ever commercial plane two years behind schedule. FedEx\\'s decision cuts the number of outstanding orders for the A380 freighter to 15 from 25. Last month, FedEx rival United Parcel Services Inc. ( UPS.N ), which has 10 A380s on order, said it had set up a team to evaluate its purchase. The switch to Boeing is a boost for the U.S. planemaker, said Morningstar analyst Chris Lozier. \"It\\'s definitely a good sign -- both the order and the cancellation,\" Lozier said. \"I\\'m guessing that certainly they have those slots promised and they should have no problem making those deliveries.\" EADS shares closed down 3 percent on the Paris stock market, while Boeing was up around 5.4 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Standard & Poor\\'s Aerospace and Defense index .GSPAERO was up 1.6 percent. \"The decision to purchase Boeing 777s was taken after Airbus announced significant delays for delivery of A380s,\" said Maury Lane, a spokesman at FedEx Express. \"Global package demand continues to grow and we need the appropriate aircraft to meet that demand.\" FedEx, based in Memphis, Tennessee, said it continues to be Airbus\\' largest wide-body airplane customer and will add new and used Airbus wide-body aircraft to its fleet in the coming years. An Airbus spokesman said the company \"regrets FedEx\\'s decision, but we understand their need to urgently address capacity issues.\" The spokesman added that Airbus remained committed to the freighter program: \"We still expect the A380 freighter to be a successful program from the outset, although we did not expect demand to be very high at the start.\" A Boeing spokesman said the company is prepared to meet FedEx\\'s delivery schedule: \"We are very pleased to meet the needs of such an important customer,\" spokesman Jim Proulx said. FedEx shares were up 83 cents, 0.7 percent, at $114.77, in afternoon trading, while Boeing was up $4.21 at $84.69, both on the NYSE.

       "  '  (Adds CFO comments on Bolivia, production, updates share price) \\n\\n  By Emelia Sithole PARIS  Nov 8 (Reuters) - Total SA ( TOTF.PA ) posted a slight\\ndrop in underlying third-quarter net profit on Wednesday as\\nproduction fell and taxes rose, but the French oil company beat\\nforecasts due to strong downstream earnings and raised its\\ndividend.  The world\\'s fourth-largest oil company by market\\ncapitalisation said on Wednesday it would, as largely expected,\\nincrease its interim dividend 16 percent to 0.87 euros per share\\nand keep its medium-term production growth targets.  \"We believe that increasing the dividend is clearly the\\nstrongest signal that we can show our shareholders of our\\nconfidence to grow profitability in the long term,\" Chief\\nFinancial Officer Robert Castaigne said on a conference call.  Adjusted net profit, which excludes changes in inventory\\nvalue and one-off items, fell to 3.11 billion euros ($4 billion)\\nfrom 3.13 billion in the same period last year but exceeded an\\naverage forecast of 3.06 billion in a Reuters poll of 12\\nanalysts.  An increase in UK petroleum taxes skimmed 143 million euros\\nfrom net profit, without which adjusted net income would have\\nbeen 4 percent higher that a year ago, Total said.  In U.S. dollar terms, underlying earnings rose 4 percent,\\ncompared with a 21 percent rise in profits calculated in a\\nsimilar manner at Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) ( RDSb.L ) and a 16\\npercent fall at BP Plc ( BP.L ).   \"Overall ... (these were) unimpressive results during a\\nquarter when most of Total\\'s peers have comfortably beaten\\nexpectations,\" Citigroup analysts said in a research note.  \"However, we would view any weakness in the shares as a\\nbuying opportunity ahead of the upstream operational recovery\\nexpected in 2007.\"  Total\\'s shares reversed earlier losses to trade 1.19 percent\\nfirmer at 55.05 euros by 1600 GMT, outperforming the DJ Stoxx\\nEuropean oil and gas sector index\\'s .SXEP 0.75 percent gain.  \\n  OIL PRODUCTION  Total\\'s oil and gas production fell a slightly\\nsteeper-than-expected 5.5 percent to 2.29 million barrels per\\nday on continuing disruptions in Nigeria, lower volumes from\\nproduction-sharing agreements and the sale of some onshore\\nassets in the United States.  This result compared with flat production at Shell and a 7\\npercent rise at industry leader Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ).  Castaigne told reporters he expected production for the full\\nyear to be 2.35 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, just\\nshort of a previous forecast of 2.40 million boed due to a\\ngreater-than-expected impact from disruptions in Nigeria.  But Total expects production to pick up in 2007. Castaigne\\nforecast 7 percent growth as new projects come on stream\\nincluding the giant Dalia field offshore Angola, which is\\nexpected to start up in mid-December.  Castaigne said production at Dalia would be built up\\nprogressively over a period of around six months and would\\neventually contribute around 4 percent of group output.  This would put it on track to achieve its target of average\\nannual output growth of close to 4 percent between 2005 and\\n2010, broadly in line with BP\\'s plans but exceeding expectations\\nfor many other oil majors, including Shell.  \"In our view, Total has one of the best combinations of\\nnear-term and longer-term exploration and production volume\\ngrowth in the sector,\" a London-based analyst said.  Like others in the industry, Total\\'s downstream refining and\\nfuel marketing business was a key driver for group profits in\\nthe third quarter.  \"Since the beginning of the fourth quarter 2006, oil prices\\nhave remained high, albeit at a level below the year-to-date\\naverage, and refining margins have maintained a level close to\\nthat of the third quarter 2006,\" the company said in a\\nstatement.  Castaigne said the group was on track with its capital\\nspending objective for the full year of $14.5 billion, excluding\\nacquisitions.  He also reiterated the group\\'s support for exploration and\\nproduction chief Christophe de Margerie, who is facing\\nallegations in a French investigation over oil purchases made\\nunder the U.N.\\'s oil-for-food programme in Iraq.  Castaigne said Margerie would take over as chief executive\\nas planned from Thierry Desmarest in mid-February and that there\\nwas no basis for the allegations against him.  Total was also more upbeat than rivals such as the UK\\'s BG\\n( BG.L ) about the future of its investments in Bolivia after it\\nsigned new operating contracts in line with President Evo\\nMorales\\' nationalisation of energy resources.  \"These should profitably unlock our very large resources\\nbase there,\" Castaigne said on a conference call with analysts.\\n (Additional reporting by  Tom Bergin  in London)\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Inc.\\n( IPG.N ), the world\\'s No. 3 advertising services company, on\\nWednesday reported a smaller quarterly net loss, helped by\\nhigher spending by its established advertising and marketing\\nclients.  Interpublic, whose ad agencies include DraftFCB,\\nMcCann-Erickson and Lowe Worldwide, reported a third-quarter\\nnet loss applicable to common shareholders of $6.1 million, or\\n1 cent a share, compared with a loss of $107.8 million, or 25\\ncents a share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose 1 percent to $1.45 billion at the advertising\\ngiant, which is in the midst of a turnaround after struggling\\nwith client losses, earnings restatements and management\\nchange.  IPG\\'s results were better than expected on Wall Street,\\nwhere analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had forecast a\\nloss of 13 cents a share on revenue of $1.41 billion. Shares of\\nIPG rose 3 percent in early trade on the New York Stock\\nExchange.  Another closely watched benchmark, organic revenue, which\\nexcludes the impact of foreign currency and recent\\nacquisitions, rose 2.7 percent as higher spending by clients\\nhelped offset account losses, such as Bank of America ( BAC.N ).  But IPG has also won some high-profile accounts this year,\\nmost notably Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), which moved to\\nDraftFCB. The win was made even more significant because it\\nappeared to confirm IPG\\'s decision earlier this year to create\\nDraftFCB by combining its highly successful direct marketing\\nservice, Draft, with a creative agency, FCB.  \"Obviously, Wal-Mart is a great win for us,\" IPG Chief\\nExecutive Michael Roth said on a conference call. \"We kind of\\nview this from the IPG perspective as a validation of our\\nstrategy.\"  Roth also said IPG was winning new accounts \"across the\\nboard,\" adding that he was \"quite pleased with the progress\\nwe\\'re making with respect to the turnaround.\"  \"I think out results indicate we\\'re on track.\"  One area IPG has been trying to improve is its spending.\\nThe company managed to cut its operating expenses in the third\\nquarter to $1.43 billion from $1.55 billion.  It has also promised to be more transparent after it came\\nunder heavy criticism because of accounting problems and a\\nprobe by regulators.  In light of that, it disclosed as part of its earnings\\nreport on Wednesday that it had undertaken a review of its\\nstock options policies.  It said the review was nearly complete and had found \"no\\nevidence of any systematic pattern of selecting an exercise\\nprice for options based on the lowest stock price over the\\nperiod preceding option grants.\" It also found that all grants\\nmade after 2002 had been accounted for correctly.  But IPG also said it had uncovered what it called\\n\"deficiencies\" in \"controls related to the granting,\\ndocumenting and accounting for stock options.\"  As a result of these deficiencies, it said there were some\\nerrors in accounting for options prior to 2002, although they\\nwere not material. Because of the errors, it has added to its\\nbooks $26.4 million of accumulated compensation expense as of\\nJan. 1, 2006.  IPG shares were up 33 cents at $11 in early trade on the\\nNew York Stock Exchange.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - The world\\'s top accounting firms will club together on Wednesday to call for an overhaul of how companies report performance, proposing real-time results rather than quarterly earning statements, the Financial Times said. \\n\\n The heads of the \"Big Four\" accounting giants -- Deloitte & Touche DLTE.UL, Ernst & Young ERNY.UL, PricewaterhouseCoopers PWC.UL and KPMG KPMG.UL -- and two other firms would say the financial reporting model of the last century has become redundant, the newspaper said. They would instead propose that static quarterly financial statements be replaced by real-time, Internet-based reporting, including a wider range of performance measures. \"We believe the current model is broken,\" KPMG International Chairman Mike Rake was quoted in the FT as saying. \"There are significant shortcomings to U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and issues of concern with international financial reporting standards. We\\'re not in a very happy situation,\" he said. Rake and his five counterparts, including the heads of Grant Thornton and BDO, were due to unveil a joint paper in Paris on Wednesday, the newspaper said. Corporate reporting had largely been unaffected by the advent of the Internet and digitisation -- two developments that have drastically altered the way companies operate, the FT said. \"Current systems of reporting and auditing company information will need to change -- toward the public release of more non-financial information customised to the user, and accessed far more frequently than is currently done,\" the joint paper said. The discrepancy between the \"book\" and \"market\" values of many listed firms was evidence that the content of traditional financial statements was of limited use, the accounting firms said. The FT said the proposed changes would result in the most significant shake-up of the data flows that feed markets since the introduction of accounting standards and independent auditing by the United States in the 1930s. The six accounting leaders had been working on the proposals for more than a year, the FT said.',\n",

The introduction of the reconnaissance aircraft is aimed at boosting South Korea\\'s response to changing strategic dynamics on the Korean peninsula, the ministry said. South and North Korea remain technically at war under a truce that ended the 1950-53 Korea War. Political ties have warmed between them in recent years although military tension remains high and ratcheted up further after the North tested a nuclear device on October 9. South Korea is poised to take over wartime command control over its 670,000 troops from the United States some time in the next six years. The United States has about 30,000 troops in the country to deter possible North Korean aggression.

The Nihon Keizai Shimbun business daily reported on Wednesday that Isuzu would ask former top shareholder GM to sell the 60 percent stakes it holds in Ohio-based venture DMAX Ltd. and Isuzu Motors Polska Sp. in Poland. Toyota, which announced plans a day earlier to buy 5.9 percent of Isuzu as part of a broad tie-up to develop advanced diesel engines, would buy the entire portions held by GM for tens of billions of yen, the paper said, without citing sources. Toyota also denied the report. The paper said Isuzu President Yoshinori Ida would propose the plan to GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner in a meeting in Tokyo on Wednesday. Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe is also set to meet Wagoner separately to discuss the plan, it said. The restructuring U.S. auto giant in April dissolved its 35-year equity alliance with Isuzu to raise cash, but said their relationship would remain intact at the operational level. Ida and Wagoner met on Wednesday as scheduled months in advance, Isuzu said, adding they confirmed their partnership would continue as planned. The joint ventures in Moraine, Ohio, and Tychy, Poland, are crucial for GM. The 6.6-liter V8 diesel engines produced at DMAX are mounted on the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-sized pickup trucks, while the 1.7-liter engines in Poland fuel several cars under its Opel brand.

GM said 239 of its 681 vehicle models and its variants will see price increases. Some models such as the redesigned Chevy Silverado pickup, new Saturn Aura sedan and Chevy Aveo compact car are excluded from the price hikes, GM said. Actual transaction prices for vehicles change every month depending on the cash rebates and other consumer incentives on a particular model. GM has warned that it faces a tough U.S. market and record-high commodity costs despite progress made under a sweeping restructuring. Increased costs for commodities, including steel and plastics, that go into the production of a vehicle have also made it difficult for GM and its cross-town rivals to wrangle price cuts from suppliers.

       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Surprise news that Volkswagen\\'s ( VOWG.DE ) chief executive will resign at year\\'s end left investors guessing on Wednesday about what the future holds for top lieutenant and reform driver Wolfgang Bernhard. \\n\\n Analysts said Bernhard could be a casualty in the fallout from the unexplained departure of CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder, and said they were concerned that VW, Europe\\'s largest carmaker, could lose the focus on cost-cutting he has driven. Citigroup downgraded the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy\", saying both Bernhard and group finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch -- two top Pischetsrieder allies -- could wind up as collateral damage. \"At worse, the positions of CFO Poetsch, responsible for capital discipline, and VW Brand CEO Bernhard, responsible for driving production savings, could be in jeopardy,\" it wrote. VW was not available for comment on the situation. Chosen by Pischetsrieder to head the VW brand, the 46-year old restructuring expert with the movie-star looks has been at the forefront of VW\\'s campaign to slash costs and jobs at the group\\'s troubled western German operations. Bernhard is responsible for delivering 7 billion euros ($8.9 billion) in gross earnings improvements at the VW brand by 2008, and has aggressively looked to prune benefits and extend working hours for the roughly 100,000 workers at the six traditional VW plants in western Germany. His presence has been seen as a guarantee that the far-reaching changes necessary at Volkswagen would not be hijacked by special interests within the company resistant to surrendering VW\\'s historically cozy system of consensus-based decisions, influenced in part through labor\\'s co-management. Martin Winterkorn, the head of the Audi premium division and protege of powerful VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, will replace Pischetsrieder, the company said late on Tuesday. Markets fear that a Bernhard departure would undermine reforms at a company still recovering from cronyism blamed for a series of scandals last year, which included criminal investigations of bribery, fraud and paid sexual favors. \"If he goes, the stock is going to go way down,\" an automotive analyst said, declining to be named. German bank HVB said VW\\'s refusal to explain the CEO\\'s sudden resignation raised the question of whether the focus and cost discipline that Pischetsrieder championed would continue. Focus magazine of Germany reported that Pischetsrieder, whose contract was just extended six months ago until April 2012, resigned after confronting opposition from five of the six members of the supervisory board\\'s key steering committee, led in particular by all three labor representatives. Its shares swung through a wide 3-euro range and were off 1.4 percent at 80.08 euros by 1105 GMT, the leading decliner in the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP. The stock has been the index\\'s second-best performer this year. CHASED OUT OF DAIMLER The market had already speculated whether Bernhard would throw in the towel, frustrated by the highly sensitive politics prevalent at a company where 97 percent of its German workers are organized through the powerful IG Metall trade union and labor representatives make up half of the supervisory board. Bernhard, a no-nonsense manager with little patience for bureaucracy endemic to former state-owned companies such as Volkswagen, has already run into problems with powerful German works councils in the past. In April 2004, DaimlerChrysler\\'s DCXGn.DE supervisory board blocked Bernhard from taking over as head of the Mercedes Car Group. The move came just days before he was set to assume the post, amid German media reports that labor was out for blood following reported comments that he called former pearl Mercedes a \"restructuring case\". \"A change of (Volkswagen) management at the highest level at such a sensitive time will raise questions about deeper internal conflict amongst management,\" Morgan Stanley said in a note. \"Some investors may speculate that this may hasten Dr. Bernhard\\'s departure from VW and possible return to DCX to head the Mercedes car business, or to rescue Chrysler,\" the bank continued.',\n",

Cisco said profit before special items rose to $1.9 billion, or 31 cents per share, in its fiscal first quarter, from $1.6 billion, or 25 cents per share, a year ago. The result beat the average Wall Street forecast of 29 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. \"It\\'s a very impressive quarter.

Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers told analysts on a conference call that he expected fiscal second-quarter revenue to rise 24 percent to 25 percent from a year ago, or to rise 14 percent to 15 percent excluding Scientific Atlanta. Analysts said one of the drivers of growth is Cisco\\'s video business, which is gaining steam alongside rising consumer demand for Web-based television services, known as Internet Protocol television (IPTV). \"More than Scientific-Atlanta, I think the deployment of IPTV and next-generation carrier networks is going to be a pretty strong market opportunity for Cisco,\" Suppiger said. Cisco said net profit for the quarter ended October 28 rose to $1.6 billion, or 26 cents per share, from $1.3 billion, or 20 cents per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 25 percent to $8.2 billion, with Scientific Atlanta, which was not part of Cisco last year, contributing $584 million.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Three leading U.S. home builders warned on Tuesday that the slowdown in the country\\'s once-soaring real estate market continued in the latest quarter as deteriorating consumer confidence and falling prices cast a growing pall over the sector. \\n\\n Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ) said it expects to report a 10 percent drop in quarterly home-building revenue, and warned of continuing softness in formerly booming markets such as Northern California and parts of Florida. The company also said it expects to take fourth-quarter write-downs of $50 million to $100 million on both the land it owns and has options to buy, up from a prior forecast of $4 million. The charges will reduce net earnings by 18 cents to 36 cents per share. Meanwhile, Toll Brothers\\' smaller rival Beazer Homes USA Inc. ( BZH.N ), which builds houses largely for first-time buyers, posted a 44-percent decline in quarterly earnings and forecast profit sharply below expectations for its 2007 fiscal year. Luxury homebuilder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. ( HOV.N ) said late on Tuesday it expects a preliminary fourth-quarter net loss, due in part to charges related to cancellations. Though the reports showed weakness at both extremes of the market, none was unexpected, coming on top of a series of government and industry reports that showed America\\'s long housing boom has corrected. New home sales and prices are both sharply below year-ago levels, as rising interest rates and steep energy prices dampen consumer spending. As a result, neither Toll\\'s nor Beazer\\'s shares suffered much in Tuesday trading. Toll Brothers\\' stock fell as much as 2 percent in early trading but later recovered and closed near to unchanged, a sign investors had already factored in weakness. Beazer\\'s shares, meanwhile, actually edged higher as results were not as weak as Wall Street had expected. But Hovnanian stock fell 1.9 percent. While Toll\\'s write-offs were larger than the market expected, John Tomlinson, an analyst at Majestic Research, said the move made sense. \"They (Toll Brothers) just don\\'t want to exercise all these options on land contracts if demand is so weak at the high end of the market,\" he said. Tomlinson said 92 percent of the local U.S. markets that Majestic reviewed showed negative year-over-year order trends in September. CONFIDENCE WANES Toll Brothers\\' chief executive said the economic trends are leading customers -- even those in the high income bracket that his company serves -- to take a wait-and-see approach. \"Nobody wants to buy something that they think will cost less two weeks or two months later,\" said Toll Brothers Chief Executive Robert Toll on a conference call. Preliminary numbers show the company posted home-building revenue of $1.81 billion for the fourth quarter ended October 31. Analysts, on average, were expecting $1.87 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Toll Brothers said quarterly total contracts suffered from a higher-than-normal 585 cancellations, one-fourth of which came in the Orlando and Northern California markets. The company lowered its land position by around 6,500 lots, ending the quarter with around 74,000 lots owned or controlled, a decline of 19 percent. \"Given falling home prices, we believe it is necessary and prudent for the builders to keep trimming more recent lot positions,\" UBS analyst Margaret Whelan said in a note to investors. Toll Brothers said it expected to deliver between 6,300 and 7,300 homes for fiscal 2007, compared with its previous forecast of 7,000 to 8,000. The company expects to deliver between 1,500 and 1,800 homes in the current first quarter. The Horsham, Pennsylvania company is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter financial results on December 5 and did not update its previous forecast of earnings of $1.33 to $1.53 per share. Toll Brothers shares closed down 1 cent at $28.04, Beazer shares closed up 13 cents at $42.07 and Hovnanian shares closed down 57 cents at $29.04, all on the New York Stock Exchange.

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Consumers face ever higher oil prices in coming decades as investment in new supply is too slow to meet growing demand, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday in its annual World Energy Outlook. \\n\\n A barrel of crude may cost a nominal $57.79 in 2010 or $51.50 in real terms, up from a respective $40 and $35 expected last year, the IEA said. The nominal price may hit $97.30 in 2030, up from $65 expected last year. It could even reach $130.30 if investment falls short. \"We have revised upwards our assumptions for oil prices in this Outlook,\" said the adviser to 26 industrialized countries. \"This revision reflects the continuing recent tightness of crude oil and refined products markets.\" Oil in New York hit a record $78.40 in 2006, leaving consumer governments worried about their economies. Concern is also mounting over risks to energy supplies and climate change from burning fossil fuels. IEA Executive Director Claude Mandil told reporters on Tuesday he saw a moderate oil price as below $60 a barrel. The IEA\\'s 596-page study urges world leaders to enact policies that will leave the world consuming 10 percent less fuel in 2030 than if demand were unchecked. To meet the world\\'s thirst for oil, $4.3 trillion needs to be invested in oilfields and refineries by 2030 and it is far from certain all the investment will occur, the IEA said. Resource nationalism, the trend for countries such as Venezuela and Russia to seek more cash and control from companies that work their oil and gas fields, is among the factors that may restrain investment. The required investment of $164 billion a year is almost double actual spending of more than $100 billion a year in the first half of this decade, the IEA said. \"Investment needs to increase in each decade of the projection period as existing infrastructure becomes obsolete and demand increases,\" the report said. Most of the investment -- $125 billion a year -- would be for developing and exploring oilfields with some $30 billion devoted to oil refining. A shortfall in investment in new supplies would send oil prices even higher. The nominal crude price in 2030 would be $33, or 34 percent, higher than the $97.30 assumed should investment in OPEC oilfields fall short, the IEA said. The crude price referred to in the IEA study is the average oil import price for the agency\\'s members. It traded at an average discount of $5.97 to U.S. crude CLc1 in 2005.',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Group Inc., which owns the largest U.S. stock exchange, said on Wednesday it will slash 520 jobs, or nearly 18 percent of its work force, in the latest sign of wrenching changes in the once not-for-profit exchange sector. \\n\\n Four hundred employees and 120 full-time consultants at the New York Stock Exchange and other business units will be affected by the cuts, the company said in a statement. An NYSE spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement\\'s contents. The cuts aim to reduce costs and get rid of duplicate services following the NYSE\\'s March takeover of electronic trading platform Archipelago Holdings Inc., a deal which turned it into a publicly listed company. That takeover brought more automation to the storied exchange, which has also come under increasing competitive pressure from its biggest rival, the all-electronic Nasdaq  ( NDAQ.O ). Over 950 out of 3,484 employees have lost jobs at the NYSE since March 2005, bringing the layoffs to about 35 percent of its work force, the company said. The latest cuts are unlikely to be the last. \"This move was almost overdue. And there\\'s more on the way,\" said Richard A. Herr, analyst at financial services firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. In a long-anticipated move last week, the NYSE said it will shut down one of its five trading rooms around Wall Street, citing its hybrid trading platform and cost cutting efforts as reasons. That plan meant probable layoffs for the specialist firms whose employees have traditionally handled stock trading, rather than jobs at the exchange itself. Herr said the latest cuts, the largest to date, were a sign of how the NYSE is adapting to Archipelago\\'s electronic model, adding that he still expects the exchange to maintain some form of floor trading. The job cuts also signal the exchange\\'s focus on profitability, now that it is a public company, said John Jakobson, a former seat holder at the NYSE. \"This is all to make this place extraordinarily profitable for shareholders. That has been the objective since the beginning and John Thain has made no mistake,\" Jakobson said. The NYSE had previously outlined cost savings of $200 million over 2 years. \"They told us the numbers, they just didn\\'t tell us how they would get there. Now we know,\" Herr said. The NYSE said about 150 employees of the Securities Industry Automation Corp. included in the latest job cuts will join the American Stock Exchange. NYSE said last month it was buying the remaining portion of SIAC that it did not own from the Amex. The NYSE Regulation operation will not be affected by this move.',\n",

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Google Inc. Chief Executive Eric Schmidt on Tuesday denied a widely circulated rumor that his company had set aside $500 million to settle copyright claims by media companies as part of its deal to acquire video-sharing site YouTube Inc. \\n\\n Speaking to more than 500 Internet industry insiders at the annual Web 2.0 Summit, Schmidt said an anonymous blog post asserting YouTube has reserved $500 million for legal claims, out of the $1.65 billion takeover price, was \"not true.\" Web and sports entrepreneur Mark Cuban, an outspoken critic of the Google-YouTube deal, late last month posted a claim from an anonymous blogger that he had inside information on the secret reserve plan. The blogger claimed to be a digital media industry veteran with inside knowledge of the deal. Cuban introduced the rumor on his Blog Maverick site, saying he had not verified the details, but that the rumor \"rings true\" and he trusted the source. The rumor was circulated around the Internet by blogs and picked up by technology industry publications Cnet and ZDNet and a top Google-watching site, Search Engine Watch. Schmidt was interviewed on stage at a session of the three-day Web 2.0 event by conference organizer John Battelle. In a two-part question, Battelle asked whether Google\\'s deal included a secret reserve for legal claims and, secondly, what progress Google was making in striking licensing deals with media companies to avoid threats of legal action. \"The former is not true,\" Schmidt said in response to the question of whether \"a very large sum of money was set aside to buy peace\" between YouTube and big media companies. \"The latter is,\" the Google CEO continued. \"We have visited as many media companies as we can\" to reach copyright licensing deals that can insulate both YouTube and Google, he said. Television and video producers, along with music labels, are angry that pirated versions of their copyrighted programming are frequently posted by users to YouTube\\'s site and have become a prime attraction of the video site.

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - IBM ( IBM.N ) is combining software and services to attract smaller, more-profitable tech outsourcing and consulting work even as two recent contracts signal that the era of large deals is not yet over, a senior executive said on Tuesday. \\n\\n The big contracts with Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ) and French shipper CMA CGM Group could give International Business Machines Corp. its best quarter of technology services deals in nearly two years, analysts said. But Ginni Rometty, senior vice president of IBM global business services, one of two divisions in the group\\'s largest unit, cautioned that one quarter does not yet make a trend. \"The very large deals are very intermittent and not always predictable,\" she told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. \"You have both dynamics coming at the same time. In general, there is a trend of clients doing things in more bite-sized pieces.\" IBM of Armonk, New York, may report that fourth-quarter contracts for technology outsourcing and consulting deals rose at least 13 percent from a year earlier to an estimated $13 billion, according to Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, who has an \"outperform\" rating on the stock. Rometty, who reports to Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano, said recent large contracts do not yet signal a return of the megadeals of the past, but they do supplement the growth of smaller, shorter signings that are typically more profitable. IBM is offering about 40 so-called business solutions that combine software and services for specific client problems, Rometty said. These include claims-processing for insurers as well as ways to track products from manufacturers to buyers. IBM and other companies recently announced a service dubbed \"Beer Living Lab\" to track cargo shipments of Heineken beer from Europe to the United States using satellite and cellular technology. The goal is to reduce the reams of paperwork and red tape now required for such shipping, Rometty said. Expected growth in fourth-quarter services signings would counter a series of disappointing quarters for IBM in which services deals dipped as low as $9.6 billion in the second quarter, down 34 percent from a year earlier and the lowest since the third quarter of 2002. IBM services signings are a closely watched barometer of future revenue growth. Revenue in services rose just 2.7 percent in the third quarter, compared with 8.9 percent growth in computer hardware and 8.5 percent growth in software. \\'BIG HURDLE\\' Even at $13 billion, IBM\\'s fourth-quarter services signings would still fall short of the four-year, fourth-quarter average of $14.9 billion, according to figures compiled by Sacconaghi. \"There\\'s still a big hurdle ahead of them,\" said Alexander Motsenigos, a program director at market researcher IDC who studies technology services contracts. Technology services make up about half of IBM\\'s revenue and are its biggest business, but the segment\\'s profitability lags software and hardware. Bookings were down nearly 12 percent in the first nine months against the same period in 2005. \"Fourth-quarter bookings, critical if IBM is going to try to reestablish better growth prospects for services, are likely to be solid enough to remove it as an issue, at least for the current quarter,\" wrote Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Laura Conigliaro, who has a \"buy\" rating on IBM shares. Investor concern over services bookings has been a drag on IBM shares, according to Conigliaro. The stock is up about 13 percent this year compared with the 35 percent gain of competitor Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ). IBM trades at 14 times expected 2007 earnings per share compared with HP\\'s 16. In the Vodafone deal, announced on October 5, the British mobile phone service provider outsourced information technology functions to IBM and Electronic Data Systems Corp. EDS.N. Vodafone did not disclose the contract size, but Sacconaghi estimates it is worth some $2 billion to IBM over seven years. Also last month, IBM and Marseilles, France-based CMA CGM, the world\\'s third-largest shipper, set up a joint venture to provide CMA with IT systems and support. Sacconaghi estimates the deal\\'s value to IBM at $590 million over 10 years.',\n",

The stock edged up less than 1 percent.

The company reported a net profit of $715.7 million, or $6.43 a share, compared with a loss of $9.2 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier. Net profit in the quarter was boosted by the closing of the sale in September of rights to open a Macau casino to Australia\\'s Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd. PBL.AX for $900 million. Excluding that gain and some other special items, Wynn posted an adjusted loss of 1 cent per share. Wall Street expected 6 cents per share profit, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. \"It\\'s a lot of below the line stuff,\" said Joseph Fath, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price Associates, which owns Wynn shares, explaining the difference between Wynn\\'s results and Wall Street\\'s forecasts. \"It\\'s meaningless in this company because it is a development-stage enterprise.\" Wynn Resorts, created by casino mogul Wynn, opened its first casino in April 2005, the $2.7 billion Wynn Las Vegas, which set a new standard for luxury hotels in the U.S. gambling capital. It opened its second casino in Macau in September, which is finally expected to cost about $1.2 billion. The company is expanding its Macau casino as well as building a $1.74 billion, 2,042-room casino-resort, called Encore, next to its Las Vegas property. Wynn, who has shown an interest in the Atlantic City, New Jersey market, declined to give details of his plans for the oceanside resort. \"The potential exists for Atlantic City to become fashionable and exciting,\" Wynn said. \"I think that market can be broadened.\" Wynn Resorts said net revenue during the quarter rose 26.5 percent to $318.1 million. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates expected it to post sales of $303.9 million. Net casino revenue at Wynn Las Vegas increased to $131.9 million from $123 million. Table win percentage -- the amount of money won from gamblers -- was 22.3 percent, slightly above the expected range of 19 percent to 22 percent.

Crude stocks rose 400,000 barrels, below the forecast for a 700,000-barrel build. \"The bullish tone is diluted by the fact that, in the distillate breakdown, heating oil stocks actually rose by 300,000 (barrels),\" BNP Paribas said in a note. High inventory levels have worried members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. On Wednesday, Gulf members of the producer group, who met in Abu Dhabi, said they were fully committed to the cut of 1.2 million barrels per day agreed upon in Doha last month. \"All of OPEC is committed (to the cuts),\" United Arab Emirates Oil Minister Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli said. Several ministers, including Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi, have said the market remains oversupplied and that further cuts could be agreed on at OPEC\\'s next meeting on December 14. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Wednesday that OPEC\\'s cut has stabilized the oil price between $55 and $60. High inventory levels, combined with skepticism about OPEC\\'s commitment to production cuts, have helped to pull prices down by around 25 percent from the record high of $78.40 for U.S. crude hit in July. But Goldman Sachs said inventories were progressively being eroded by stronger-than-expected demand. \"We continue to believe that the recent, lower oil price levels will prove short-lived, particularly as the lower prices have contributed to exceptionally strong demand growth in the U.S.,\" the investment bank wrote in a report.

Cisco rose 0.7 percent, or 16 cents, to $24.84 on Nasdaq after hitting its highest level in nearly two years, on news that UBS raised its price target on the stock and before what is expected to be a strong earnings report on Wednesday. Cisco shares were among the biggest positive influences on the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq.  DOW TAKES FLIGHT WITH BOEING Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) was a strong influence on the Dow, jumping 5.4 percent, or $4.37, to $84.85 on the New York Stock Exchange after the plane deal was announced. The Financial Times also reported that Boeing will boost production rates for its new 787 long-range aircraft in response to higher-than-expected demand.

Cablevision re-affirmed its forecast for basic video subscriber growth of 3.5 percent to 4.0 percent in 2006, and total revenue growth in the high teens percentage. It also said it sees capital expenditure of $750 million. Its net loss slimmed to $59.2 million, or 21 cents a share, in the third quarter from $62.9 million, or 22 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $1.41 billion from $1.24 billion. Analysts, on average, expected the company, which also owns the Madison Square Garden arena in New York and cable TV networks AMC, IFC and WE, to post a loss of $38 million, or 13 cents per share, on revenue of $1.41 billion. Cablevision, which serves 3 million households in the New York metropolitan area, said average monthly revenue per basic video customer rose to $111.13 from $96.69 a year ago.

Clear Channel Outdoor, the majority-owned unit of Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ) has a market value of $8.9 billion. Private equity groups Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. are in advanced talks to buy Clear Channel Communications, the largest U.S. radio company. A deal could put the outdoor business in play, as the winner would use the sale to pay down debt. Paris-based JCDecaux has expressed its interest in recent conversations with at least two of the private-equity teams, the Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. \"Combining Clear Channel Outdoor and JCDecaux would create one of the few global media companies in the world with a lot of potential growth,\" said Jean-Francois Decaux, JCDecaux co-chief executive, in the Journal interview. \"Of course, we\\'re interested.\"',\n",

( CCO.N ) in a deal that would create a billboard powerhouse. \\n\\n A merger could make strategic sense for JCDecaux, analysts said, creating a group with consolidated sales of roughly $5 billion and a stock market value of nearly $15 billion. \"We have always said we were interested by CCO,\" a JCDecaux spokeswoman told Reuters. \"Our interest (for CCO) relates to their entire outdoor business.\" A CCO spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. CCO\\'s future has been in question since parent Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ) started talks with private equity groups Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which are interested in buying the radio company. This in turn has fueled speculation that whoever buys Clear Channel Communications could sell all or part of its 90 percent interest in its outdoor advertising affiliate to pay off debt. JCDecaux has expressed its interest in recent conversations with at least two of the private-equity teams, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar with the matter. It was widely known that JCDecaux was interested in joining forces with one of its two U.S. based rivals, CCO or CBS Outdoor, which is owned by CBS Corp. ( CBSa.N ). Some analysts, however, voiced concern over a potentially high price tag, the funding of the deal and regulatory hurdles -- notably in Europe, where CCO is JCDecaux\\'s main competitor. Clear Channel Outdoor has a market value of $8.9 billion while JCDecaux has a market capitalization of $5.9 billion. If JCDecaux managed to grab CCO it would become \"the unmistakable leader in the outdoor business with around 45 percent of the worldwide market and an even higher market share in street furniture,\" Fortis Bank analysts said in a note. But Fortis Bank said issues remained, such as the scope of any deal, the possible dilution of the family controlling shareholders\\' stake and the price that JCDecaux would pay. The Decaux family owns over 70 percent of the group\\'s capital. In afternoon trading, JCDecaux shares fell 2.26 percent to 20.36 euros, while CCO shares fell 12 cents to $25.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. A BOLD DEAL UBS said a deal would be a \"bold move\" for JCDecaux and require a combination of cash and shares, with the JCDecaux family likely to lower its stake below 50 percent. Ixis Securities said it expected \"strong synergies\" in billboard and transport advertising if a deal came through. \"Combining Clear Channel and JCDecaux would create one of the few global media companies in the world with a lot of potential growth,\" JCDecaux Co-Chief Executive Jean-Francois Decaux told the Journal. \"Of course we\\'re interested.\" Analysts said that JCDecaux might only be able to buy or interested in purchasing part of CCO. Whether that would be its U.S. or international business was a subject of debate. Deutsche Bank said in a research note on Wednesday that a \"transaction would make sense, especially overseas,\" but that whether CCO would want to sell its domestic U.S. business would be an important issue. \"We believe a sale of the international unit separately is a possibility,\" Deutsche Bank said. Decaux is strong in Europe and Asia but weaker in the United States, so there should be few U.S. antitrust concerns. But authorities could look at local markets for overlap. But Exane BNP Paribas cautioned in a recent note that JCDecaux might run into trouble acquiring the European business of CCO since both companies \"have a very significant market share\" in many European countries. \"It could however be interested in the U.S. business,\" the note said.

News Corp. took a non cash charge of $1 billion to reduce the value of its television stations federal licenses in the year earlier period. Revenue rose 4 percent to $5.9 billion. Wall Street expected the company to post a profit of 21 cents per share and revenue of $5.9 billion. Operating income fell 6 percent to $851 million, from $909 million a year earlier, dragged by lower revenue at its movies division. Film division operating income fell 35 percent to $239 million from $368 million as the year earlier quarter included strong revenue from syndication fees for Fox TV shows and DVD sales from \"Robots\" and \"Hide and Seek\". Its television division operating income rose 20 percent to $192 million primarily from its U.S. advertising sales at its Fox TV network. Its cable network operating profit rose 26 percent to $249 million mainly on an advertising sales gain from its Fox News network and regional sports networks.

The results set the stage for a hot contest in the fourth quarter, when Sirius and rival XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. XMSR.O will battle to woo holiday shoppers to sign up or give the radios as gifts. Both offer subscriptions at up to $13 a month. \"Sirius reported a solid result that mirrored peer XM\\'s in its notable absence of disappointments,\" Sanford Bernstein analyst Craig Moffitt said in client note. \"With their release coming five weeks into the fourth quarter ... their affirmation of year-end guidance is likely to be a welcome sign that the fourth quarter is already off to a strong start.\" Sirius\\' net loss narrowed to $162.9 million, or 12 cents a share, from $180.4 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 14 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue for the New York-based company was $167.1 million, just shy of the analysts\\' view of $168.6 million. Both Sirius and XM are growing rapidly, but losing money as they beef up their technologies and enlist top-shelf entertainment, such as Sirius deals with the National Football League, Nascar and Stern. Both companies earlier this year briefly halted making some models because they were not compliant with federal guidelines. This week, each voiced optimism about the holiday season, saying that they will have enough product to meet demand. \"What we have seen in each year is that the holiday season has loomed large,\" Sirius Chief Financial Officer David Freer told Reuters in an interview. \"We have seen huge gift-volume in each of the last three years and we are anticipating that will be the case again this year.\" During the third quarter, Sirius added about 441,000 net subscribers for a total of 5.1 million. The cost of acquiring each customer decreased 23 percent to $114 from $149, due to the reduction in average subsidy rates as the company continued to reduce manufacturing and chip set costs. On Monday, XM, whose offerings include Major League Baseball and an Oprah Winfrey channel, said it also had pared its quarterly loss and ended the quarter with 7.2 million subscribers. Sirius shares rose 1.2 percent, or 5 cents, to $4.14 on Nasdaq late on Wednesday.

The court scrapped the Commission\\'s initial fine because the European Union executive had not sent a statement of objections to the interested company, at that time called Arbed SA, in 1992. Arbed has since changed its name to Arcelor Luxembourg SA. \"The Commission decided to re-open the procedure as regards Arbed SA and issued a statement of objections on 8 March 2006 correcting the procedural error,\" it said in a statement. The other two units of Arcelor included in the fine are Arcelor International SA, formerly TradeArbed SA, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Arbed, and Arcelor Profil Luxembourg SA, formerly ProfilArbed SA. \"Between 1988 and 1991, the companies fixed prices, allocated quotas and exchanged confidential information in the steel beams industry covering the whole of the single market,\" the Commission said. In determining the size of the fine, the Commission took into account the size of the European Community market for the product in 1990, the last complete year of the infringement, the duration of the cartel and the size of the firms involved. \"Under normal circumstances the fine would have been at least 20 million euros, plus an increase for the duration,\" it said. \"However, by way of exceptional circumstances, the Commission considers that it has already taken a position on the amount of the fine for Arbed SA in its 1994 decision, which the Court of First Instance reduced to 10 million euros. The total fine imposed in this case is therefore 10 million euros.\"',\n",

Microsoft will pay an additional $108 million upfront for use of patents, Novell said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Last week, Microsoft and Novell entered a broad set of business and technological agreements to make their products work together better to serve corporate customers using both Linux and Windows computer servers. Linux is the most popular variant of open-source software. Unlike proprietary software, open-source software lets developers share code and add functions, and users only pay for custom features, maintenance and technical support. Microsoft agreed not to sign a similar agreement with any other Linux distributor for three years. Microsoft's pact with Novell dealt a blow to other Linux distributors such as market leader Red Hat Inc. RHAT.O, according to analysts. Under the pact, which will run until at least 2012, Novell will also pay Microsoft at least $40 million over five years for use of Microsoft's patents based on a percentage of its revenue from open-source products. Microsoft also agreed to spend $12 million a year to market scenarios where users can virtually run Linux on Windows machines and vice versa. Microsoft will also spend $34 million over the life of the agreement to put in place a sales force devoted to the combined offering, Novell said. Prior to the filing, Microsoft shares rose 11 cents to $28.95 in Tuesday Nasdaq trade. Novell, up more than 10 percent since news of the pact last week, fell 12 cents to $6.50.\",\n",
       "  ' SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.\\'s Windows Vista, the software giant\\'s first major upgrade of its operating system in five years, is complete and will be available to retail customers on January 30, a senior executive said on Wednesday. \\n\\n Plagued by a series of development delays, Windows Vista is front and center of a new product cycle at the world\\'s largest software maker that includes a new version of its Office business software suite. Jim Allchin, co-president of Microsoft\\'s platforms and services division, said it expects consumers to make a \"fast and immediate\" switch to the new Windows. \"On January 30, you will be hard pressed to find a machine that doesn\\'t have Windows Vista available,\" said Allchin in a conference call with reporters and analysts. In the first year of release, Vista will be installed on more than 100 million computers worldwide, according to research firm IDC. Windows already sits on more than 90 percent of the world\\'s computers. Microsoft originally targeted a 2005 launch for Vista, then pushed the release out to 2006 before announcing in March that Vista would again be delayed. There was also speculation among analysts that Microsoft would have a hard time meeting its early 2007 target. \"One of the biggest downside risks between now and year-end was any sort of delay in the Vista introduction,\" said Romeo Dator, portfolio manager at US Global Investors, a Microsoft shareholder. \"The worst-case scenario would have been if Microsoft had said \\'we\\'re delaying it again.\\'\" Shares of Microsoft rose to their highest level since late 2004 after the news, before paring those gains. The stock, up more than 25 percent since June, closed up 3 cents at $28.98 in Nasdaq trade after touching a high of $29.23. MORE SECURE? Microsoft also said it will put Vista in the hands of large volume business customers on or before November 30 when it will hold a ceremony in New York to mark the availability of Vista, Office 2007 and 2007 Exchange e-mail server. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said Vista has already been completed in five languages including Spanish, French, Japanese and German. By the end of January, Vista will be available in 18 languages and eventually in 100 languages. Allchin, who will retire from Microsoft after Vista ships, said business customers will be drawn to the improvements in performance, reliability and security. \"In my opinion, it is the most secure system that is available and it\\'s certainly the most secure system that we\\'ve ever shipped,\" said Allchin. \"I have incredible confidence in the quality of the operating system.\" Among the new features in Windows Vista will be a new user interface with translucent windows and three-dimensional scrolling and a new search capability to look for information on the PC and across the network. In late October, Microsoft started an upgrade program so customers who buy a PC running Windows XP during the holiday shopping season can get Windows Vista at a discount or for free when the new operating system becomes available.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.\\'s ability to convert occasional players of online video games into regular gamers is key to growth for the next-generation Xbox 360 console, a company executive said on Tuesday. \\n\\n He was speaking at a conference a day after the software giant announced the debut of a video download service for its Xbox Live online service that will make some television shows and movies available in high definition video by November 22. \"The real growth here is getting to that moderate gamer. We need to bring them to the box,\" Peter Moore, vice president of Microsoft\\'s entertainment and devices division which oversees Xbox, told investors at the BMO Capital Markets conference in New York. Moore was referring to users who occasionally play video games online but have yet to spend at least $400 to buy the Xbox for their homes. Microsoft\\'s new video service, which will start initially offering about 1,000 hours of movies to rent and shows to buy, is designed to keep existing Xbox customers glued to the screen and places the video game machine at the center of the living room media hub. Moore told Reuters in an interview that it was likely the service would announce more programming partners, but he did not give any further details. \"I guarantee you that if I had three more weeks (before announcing the launch), I would have 15 logos up there,\" Moore added, referring to the logos of programming companies that have struck video deals with Xbox. They currently include Time Warner Inc.\\'s Warner Bros. movie studios and Viacom Inc.\\'s MTV Networks. The service is designed to play up the lifestyle aspects of owning a game console, which mainly appeals to gamers seeking better graphics and more in-depth games. Although videos purchased or rented on the service will not immediately be viewable on Microsoft\\'s upcoming Zune portable media player, Moore told Reuters that Microsoft had not ruled that out. \"Zune -- that is in the future,\" he said, adding that there were no immediate plans. Microsoft\\'s Zune, which hits store shelves next week, is designed to compete against Apple Computer Inc.\\'s popular iPod music and video player. Moore said Microsoft\\'s head-start in connecting video game consoles to online gaming through its Xbox Live service should prove an advantage in tapping future growth. He cited data from tracking firm DFC Intelligence that forecast the number of video game consoles connected to the Internet to quadruple by 2010. Console-connected online gaming services are opening up new revenue streams, such as advertising and additional content sales for device makers and video game publishers. Microsoft has 4 million Xbox Live subscribers, who can download game demos, chat and compete with friends, buy new maps and weapons and, soon, download TV shows and movies. Rival Sony Corp. said 3 million of the 106 million PlayStation 2 owners use its online service. The company is revamping the service, called PlayStation Network, for its PlayStation 3 console that makes its U.S. debut on November 17. Moore confirmed Microsoft\\'s expectation that Xbox 360 shipments would reach 10 million by the end of 2006, and 13 million to 15 million by the end of its 2007 fiscal year.

       "  ' GABORONE  (Reuters) - The diamond industry\\'s watchdog has agreed to publish statistics for the first time, helping open up a secretive sector ahead of a Hollywood film some fear could trigger negative publicity, officials said on Wednesday. \\n\\n The so-called Kimberley Process agreed to a delayed release of annual production and trade data from each member country during closed-door annual meetings in Botswana involving government, industry and civic group participants. The Kimberley Process was set up six years ago to certify diamonds in order to halt an illicit trade which has financed civil wars and instability. \"We agreed to release (the data) after six months, in other words they will be released mid-year the following year,\" chairman Kago Moshashane of Botswana told Reuters. The diamond industry, backed by the U.S. government, had previously opposed the release of the data, but dropped their objections this year, delegates said. \"This is a very important development. That information has to be out there so academicians and others can monitor problems and discrepancies,\" said Corinna Gilfillan, an official of non-governmental organization Global Witness, who is attending the meeting as an observer. Releasing the data, until now only available to members, will allow external players to help pinpoint discrepancies, such as when a country is exporting many more diamonds than it produces, which could include smuggled gems. NERVOUSNESS OVER FILM The industry was probably prodded to become more transparent due to nervousness over the new film, \"Blood Diamond\", starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Gilfillan said. It is due to be released next month. The sector is worried that consumer demand might be affected by the film, which shows how diamonds helped fuel a brutal civil conflict in Sierra Leone in the 1990s. \"The fact that the film is out there makes the industry vulnerable, it\\'s changed the whole dynamic,\" Gilfillan said. \"At this meeting the industry has been much more proactive in strengthening the system than they have been before.\" A delegate from the European Commission, which will assume the chair of the Kimberley Process next year, hoped more data would become available in the future. \"This is only the starting point, we will try to expand it,\" said Alyson King, a member of the Kimberley Process statistics working group. The data in future might be broken down by quarter as well as by year and could include bilateral trade, she added. \"We can analyze to a certain extent our own statistics and identify problems.

FD.N reported a quarterly loss and weaker-than-expected sales on Wednesday, as the parent of Macy\\'s struggles to boost sales at the May Department Stores it acquired last year. \\n\\n Federated, which is also the parent of Bloomingdale\\'s, posted a loss of $3 million, or 1 cent per share, for its fiscal third quarter ended October 28, compared with profit of $436 million, or 90 cents per share a year ago. Excluding May merger integration costs and inventory valuation adjustments of $145 million, Federated said its third-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were 20 cents, below analysts\\' average estimate of 25 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. \"The May stores are proving to be a little more difficult to turn around than originally anticipated,\" said Arun Daniel, a senior analyst at ING Investment Management.\"... I think the market was clearly anticipating a much faster pace than the current pace that it\\'s happening.\" Shares declined 56 cents, or 1.4 percent to $39.76 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Federated\\'s shares have risen almost 22 percent year-to-date through Tuesday. Federated acquired May Department Stores last year and converted more than 400 former May stores, such as Foley\\'s, Hecht\\'s and Filene\\'s, to the Macy\\'s name in September, creating a national chain of more than 800 Macy\\'s stores. It is now working to improve sales at the old May chains, bringing in new merchandise, such as Macy\\'s own INC and Alfani brands, and tailoring the stores to fit the local market. In September, it unleashed the largest advertising campaign in its history to promote the new, national Macy\\'s chain. But the name change was not popular with all shoppers and investors are waiting to see if Macy\\'s will be able attract former May shoppers to its stores. On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said sales lagged in Macy\\'s home business, which accounts for roughly 15 percent of sales. \"In the new Macy\\'s (stores), it was the home store that was by far the most disappointing,\" she said. She said sales in that business were hurt in part by the lower promotional activity at Macy\\'s compared with May and \"the general industry softness in home categories.\" Federated said quarterly sales rose 6 percent to $5.89 billion, missing analysts\\' expectations of $6.11 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year -- a key measurement of a retailer\\'s health known as same-stores sales -- increased 5.9 percent. Federated had forecast total sales of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion for the third-quarter and a same-store sales increase of between 3 percent and 5 percent. Craig Johnson, president of retail consulting firm Customer Growth Partners, said the heat is now on for Federated heading into the holidays. \"This season will be the \\'show me\\' season,\" he said. \"There will be a lot of attention by investors and analysts on this season.\" For the fourth-quarter, Federated said it still expects a same-store sales rise of 3 percent to 5 percent, total sales of $9.1 billion to $9.4 billion and earnings per share, excluding merger integration costs and related inventory valuation adjustments, of $1.40 to $1.50. Analysts, on average, are expecting sales of $9.21 billion and earnings of it to $1.52 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. ( RL.N ) on Wednesday said second-quarter earnings rose 31 percent as the luxury apparel and home goods company benefited from increased demand for Ralph Lauren-branded products, and it raised its full-year earnings forecast. \\n\\n Sales at its wholesale and its stand-alone retail operations rose, and its shares jumped as much as 4 percent in mid-morning trade. \"Their business is absolutely smoking,\" said Pacific Growth Equities analyst Christine Chen, adding that the company is on track for a strong holiday selling season since \"fall trends are a general indication for holiday.\" For the quarter ended September 30, the company reported net income of $137 million, or $1.28 per share, compared with $104.2 million, or 97 cents per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Sales climbed 14 percent to $1.17 billion. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had expected the company to report an average profit of $1.06 per share, on revenue of $1.16 billion. The maker of Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo and Chaps clothing also said it agreed to buy the New Campaign group from Kellwood Co. KWD.N. The business has been a Polo Ralph Lauren licensing partner for the manufacturing and distribution of men\\'s and women\\'s belts and other small leather goods under the Ralph Lauren, Lauren and Chaps lines in the United States. EXPANSION The company said it plans to aggressively expand internationally, focusing on Western Europe, China, India and Japan. Currently, it does about 15 percent of its business in Europe, about 15 percent in Asia and about 70 percent in the United States. \"Our next three-year plan, I think, will have us investing more time, money, advertising, marketing and resources to accelerate those regions,\" said Roger Farah, president and chief operating officer, in a conference call with analysts and investors. Still, he added, \"To move from a 15-15-70 mix, to a third (in each region) is a long-term project and I think we need to understand it could be a five to 10-year time horizon.\" Polo Ralph Lauren also said that many new stores will carry the Ralph Lauren name, and that it will likely open more children\\'s stores. Any increase in children\\'s stores could have implications for other high-end kids apparel companies, such as Gymboree Corp.\\'s GYMB.O Janie and Jack unit or even Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\\'s ( ANF.N ) children\\'s line, Pacific Growth\\'s Chen said. OUTLOOK For the third quarter, the company said it expects revenue growth in the \"low double-digits\" on increasing sales at retail and wholesale units. Analysts had expected third-quarter sales of $1.11 billion, up 11 percent from the year-ago period. Polo Ralph Lauren also raised its full-year earnings-per-share forecast to $3.50 to $3.60, from $3.25 to $3.35. Analysts were looking for earnings of $3.37 per share. Shares rose $1.75 to $73.35. The stock is up 75 percent so far this year, compared with a 16 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\\'s textiles apparel index .GSPTEX. Shares of Polo Ralph Lauren are selling for 18.7 times next year\\'s expected earnings, while competitor Kellwood is selling for 15.2 times earnings.',\n",

But he added: \"We will have to take another decision whenever the customer\\'s made up their mind finally.\" He also said demand was currently higher than expected for the Airbus A330 and that the Power8 cost-cutting program was \"crucial\" for the funding needs of the planned A350 XWB.',\n",
       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) swung to a third-quarter operating loss after delays to the A380 superjumbo program that have scared off major customer FedEx ( FDX.N ) led to 1 billion euros ($1.28 billion) in charges. \\n\\n The loss before interest and taxes and before goodwill impairment and exceptional items was 239 million euros, compared with a year-ago profit of 559 million, EADS said on Wednesday. The charges relating to delays to the A380 sent the result well below the average forecast for an operating profit of 301 million euros in a Reuters poll of eight analysts. EADS gave no new full-year earnings forecast after scrapping it last month. \"The struggle to reverse the A380 problems imposes a severe burden on our financial performance,\" said EADS co-Chief Executives Tom Enders and Louis Gallois in a statement. \"This together with the dollar devaluation requires drastic measures to remain competitive. Therefore the Power8 (cost-cutting) program in Airbus and structural streamlining of the group has top priority,\" they added. FEDEX BLOW Airbus received a further major blow on Tuesday when FedEx said it canceled its order for 10 A380-800F freighter aircraft because of delivery delays, opting instead to buy planes from rival U.S. planemaker Boeing ( BA.N ). EADS finance head Hans Peter Ring meanwhile cast doubt over the A380 freighter version -- UPS ( UPS.N ) had 10 on order, while International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) had five -- on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. \"If you talk about the still remaining customers, we obviously need to get them reconfirmed, that\\'s clear because all of them are in the cancellation zone, I would say, with the announced delays,\" Ring said. \"Depending on that, the freighter development will continue or probably...we will have to take another decision whenever the customers made up their mind finally.\" The biggest buyer of the world\\'s biggest plane, Emirates EMAIR.UL, said last month it would send its own audit team to Airbus before entering talks to address the A380\\'s two-year delay. Emirates has 43 of the $300 million planes on order. DECISION TIME Investors are also keen to hear news on whether EADS plans to go ahead with the development of the A350 XWB mid-sized aircraft, crucial if Airbus wants to take on Boeing\\'s fast-selling 787 Dreamliner. EADS said on Wednesday its board would make a decision on the future of the A350 XWB \"in the weeks to come\". The Power8 program would be \"crucial\" for the funding needs of the A350, should it go ahead, Ring said. Depending on the decision, contract charges would have to be taken in the fourth quarter, he added. The A350 charge would be up to 800 million euros in the \"worst case\". EADS has repeatedly reassured investors in recent months that the Airbus A400M military transporter was on schedule. Ring said the company would share the conclusions of an internal technical assessment of the program in a few weeks. EADS failed to issue a new operating earnings forecast for the full year after withdrawing it last month amid a crisis over the A380 that the company said would create a 4.8 billion-euro profit shortfall in coming years. But it repeated its July forecast that EADS would achieve full-year revenues of \"well above 37 billion euros\" based on \"430 Airbus aircraft deliveries in 2006 and strong contributions from its helicopters, defense and space businesses\". Third-quarter sales grew 14 percent to 8.489 billion euros, beating the 8.290 billion forecast in the poll, boosted by all EADS\\'s divisions, EADS said. Airbus contributed 5.416 billion euros of revenues. Shares in EADS were 2.1 percent higher at 21.1 euros in Paris by 1009 GMT, supported by market talk that a Dubai investor is buying a stake, after falling 3 percent on Tuesday following the FedEx cancellation news. Excluding the \"one-off impact of the A380 issues, the underlying performance of Airbus is strong,\" Kepler Equities analyst Pierre Boucheny wrote. But he added: \"Market concerns will not be offset by them.\" EADS\\'s stock has been hammered this year, falling 30 percent in the last six months and currently trading at just 12.5 times estimated 2007 earnings, compared with multiples of 17 for Boeing and almost 14 for French defense electronics company Thales ( TCFP.PA ), according to Reuters data.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Big oil companies will be a top target of Democratic lawmakers when they officially take over the House of Representatives early next year. \\n\\n Democrats picked up enough seats in Tuesday\\'s U.S. election to win majority control of the House and have promised to roll back billions of dollars in tax breaks and other financial incentives extended to the oil industry in energy legislation Congress passed last year. Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who is poised to be the next Speaker of the House when the new Congress convenes in January, says oil companies have unfairly earned record profits by gouging consumers at the gasoline pump. Pelosi says taking away the financial relief given to Big Oil in last year\\'s Republican-written energy law will be among the six major tasks Democrats plan to tackle in the first 100 hours after she slams the gavel to convene the new House. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday on Capitol Hill, Pelosi said Democrats would move the United States \"toward energy independence, by repealing the subsidies to Big Oil and using the money for research into alternative energy resources.\" She has also said Democrats will go after oil companies by enacting tough laws to stop gasoline price gouging and, separately, increase ethanol use and the number of cars on the road that run on the fuel. Some Democrats also want to impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies. \"We\\'re going to move on the agenda that we laid out,\" said Rep. Rahm Emanuel, who heads the House Democrats\\' campaign committee. \"The American people are ready for a real energy policy.\" Environmental groups welcomed the election results. \"The American people\\'s vision of an energy future that is very different from current policies is the winner, and Big Oil is the big loser,\" said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters. \"Last night\\'s returns demonstrate that the American people want Congress to move America toward a new, cleaner energy future,\" said the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. The energy bill had about $2.8 billion in tax breaks and financial incentives for the oil and gas industry. The legislation allowed companies to speed up writing off exploration and drilling expenses, and immediately deduct half the cost of large oil refinery expansions. Legislation to repeal those tax breaks and other government financial incentives would also have to clear the Senate and then be signed by President George W. Bush. Bush could veto any legislation that House Democrats propose, raising the possibility of energy policy deadlock over the next two years. \"You\\'ve still got a Republican president so what can you get done?\" said Robert Ebel, an energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It\\'s probably going to be two years where nothing is going to happen\" on energy issues. TAX BREAK ROLLBACK? Repealing the financial relief affects domestic oil giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), and large U.S. operations of foreign firms such as BP Plc ( BP.L ) and Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ). Mark Kibbe, a tax policy analyst with the American Petroleum Institute, said the tax breaks make it more affordable for companies to search for oil and gas in the United States, instead of looking in other countries where production costs are generally much cheaper. \"You\\'re increasing the costs of those projects and you\\'re making U.S. companies that much less competitive in the world market,\" he said. Guy Caruso, who heads the federal Energy Information Administration, warned that taking away the government\\'s financial help could kill some energy projects. \"The more expensive the project, the more affected they will be from a rollback in tax incentives and breaks,\" he said. Costly projects like drilling for crude in the very deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico or developing the thick oil trapped in shale rock in the Rocky Mountain region could be shut down, said Caruso. \"There are some projects I\\'m sure would drop off the table,\" he added.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, a supporter of crop subsidies, is in position to become leader of the Agriculture Committee now that Democrats have won a majority in the House of Representatives. \\n\\n Peterson was a pre-election booster of $3 billion in disaster relief for farmers and ranchers because of drought in the Plains and western Corn Belt this year. He said that Congress would probably pass the aid later this month. During an October interview, Peterson said he thought most of the Agriculture Committee membership \"believes we should have a continuation\" of the comparatively generous crop and dairy supports now in place. Leaders of the Senate Agriculture Committee also leaned toward retention of crop supports that date from the Depression era. A coalition of fiscal hawks, small-farm advocates and fruit, vegetable, nut and nursery crop farmers want to put more attention -- and money -- into land stewardship and public nutrition programs such as food stamps. Private consultant John Schnittker said Peterson \"is generally a big subsidy guy\" with a constituency that opposes any cuts in subsidies. In October, Peterson was cool to proposals that would lower the current limit of $360,000 a year in subsidies per farmer, a stance that may be indicative of how he wants Congress to update a $20 billion farm law due to expire in September 2007. With Democratic gains, lawmakers are likely to give more support to \"green\" payments and public nutrition, said two analysts before the election. Two newly elected senators, Democrats Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, are supporters of mandatory country-of-origin labels on red meat. Klobuchar says she wants a seat on the Senate Agriculture Committee. Casey defeated Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, an Agriculture subcommittee chairman. In Minnesota, Democrat Tim Walz defeated Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht, chairman of a House Agriculture subcommittee. In early 2005, Peterson became the Democratic leader on the committee, succeeding Charlie Stenholm of Texas. Peterson was a co-founder of Blue Dog Democrats, a group of fiscally conservative House Democrats. A former accountant and occasional guitar player in an amateur rock band, Peterson, 62, was elected to his ninth term in the House on Tuesday. His district in western Minnesota is home to dairy and grain farms. Sugar beets are grown in the Red River valley adjoining North and South Dakota.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in defense companies fell on Wednesday after a strong showing by Democrats in mid-term elections soured the long-term outlook for U.S. military spending. \\n\\n \"This may make the outlook for the next presidential elections more favorable for the Democrats...and that could have long-term implications on defense spending,\" said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at aerospace and defense specialist JSA Research. But in the short-term there is little risk to the defense budget and he advised clients to buy on weakness. Standard & Poor\\'s Aerospace and Defense index .GSPAERO fell 0.8 percent in afternoon trading, led by declines in a major defense contractors Northrop Grumman ( NOC.N ), General Dynamics ( GD.N ), and Raytheon ( RTN.N ). In Tuesday\\'s elections, Democrats swept Republicans from power in the U.S. House of Representatives and were close to winning control of the Senate. Dissatisfaction over the war in Iraq was a key factor in the election, with the Democrats vowing a change of strategy, but not going so far as to promise an immediate withdrawal. The poor showing by the Republicans, U.S. President George W. Bush\\'s party, was quickly followed by the resignation of controversial Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Despite the departure of Rumsfeld and the setback for the Republicans, defense spending is expected to remain strong at least for the next two years. The U.S. defense budget is likely to top $500 billion in fiscal year 2007, plus separate requests to fund the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan \"This development should not, in our view, have much near-term impact on defense contractors beyond headline risk,\" Robert Stallard, an analyst with Bank of America, said in a note. \"Neither political party will want to be seen to be denying the troops with two years to run to the presidential election.\" On the New York Stock Exchange, Northrop Grumman shares were down 1.7 percent to $65.25. General Dynamics fell 1.6 percent to $70.86. Raytheon dipped 1.4 percent to $48.98.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The stocks most vulnerable to the Democrats\\' congressional gains are crowded in the defense, pharmaceutical, oil and insurance sectors, while alternative energy providers are clear early winners from the change. \\n\\n Money managers and analysts say the Democrats\\' takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives, and possibly the U.S. Senate, could auger higher taxes, a hike in the minimum wage and scrutiny of tax subsidies enjoyed by some sectors that benefited from Republican control of Congress. Democrat control of the House will lead to new leadership of key congressional committees, said George Schwartz, president of Schwartz Investment Counsel, manager of the Ave Maria Funds. \"The Dems will be targeting energy, insurance, pharmaceutical and defense, and they\\'re going to have a lot of power, especially if they\\'ve got their friends over in the Senate with a majority,\" Schwartz said. Following are sketches of how stocks in some sectors might fare under Democrat leadership after Tuesday\\'s U.S. elections. PHARMACEUTICALS Democrats want to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for its more than 40 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries, and step up oversight of the pharmaceutical industry. Both moves could be a source of negative publicity that could pressure stocks, analysts and other experts said. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, who is expected to lead the House, has vowed to pass in the first 100 hours a bill granting Medicare such power. \"She won\\'t be able to do it without (Bush) signing something. But if you now have a majority in the House in favor of reining in pharmaceutical prices in that way, I think something will emerge from that,\" said David Kelly, senior economic advisor at Putnam Investments in Boston. HEALTH CARE Democratic gains may lead to more spending on hospital and health-care services and policy changes that favor generic drugs, top health-care executives told Reuters. The Democratic Party \"tends to lead more toward expenditures,\" which could benefit the industry, said Alan Miller, chief executive of hospital company Universal Health Services. \"I think net it would be positive if we have more coverage of the uninsured, which is more likely to happen with Democrats,\" Miller said. Democrats were likely to protect payments to health care providers under the massive Medicare health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, said Jay Grinney, CEO of HealthSouth Corp. ( HLS.N ), the biggest operator of U.S. rehabilitation facilities. \"It is fair to say that historically, health-care providers do better under Democratic congressional control,\" Grinney said. \"Democrats tend to want to make sure that social programs are funded.\" Both Miller and Grinney spoke on Tuesday at the Reuters Health Summit in New York. ALTERNATIVE ENERGY Voter concern over the environment suggests there might be a push in Congress to find funding or tax incentives for alternative energy sources. There also might be another attempt to tighten emission controls on coal and other sources of greenhouse gases. To date, seven different bills have been proposed by Democrats, Republicans and independents in the Senate to address greenhouse gas emissions, but none has advanced. \"You\\'ve seen the price of oil take a tremendous increase in the last year, so anything that could help offset that or be an alternative to oil, could get a boost,\" said Bob O\\'Brien, head equity trader at Evergreen Investments in Boston. Ethanol producers, such as Archer Daniels Midland Co. ( ADM.N ), and producers of wind-generated power could see benefits because of the election, said Emanuel Weintraub, managing director of Integre Advisors, which oversees about $170 million, almost all in stocks. \"I do see a real push for alternative energy and energy independence,\" Weintraub said. OIL Democrats want to end tax subsidies directed to big oil companies and enact punitive laws to prevent what politicians say is price gouging, Merrill Lynch said in a note to investors. The huge increase in profits at many energy companies, a Democrat target over the past year, and the traditional heavy backing by Republicans of oil and gas companies suggests that sector will be under pressure, analysts said. \"Every oil and gas company in the S&P 500 and every one in the Russell 2000 has been a net contributor to the Republican party over the last 10 years. That\\'s the only industry for which that\\'s true,\" said Daniel Adamson, chief executive of Blue Investment Management. \"If one had to predict a sector that would fare the worst, given new leadership in the House, it would be that one,\" said Adamson. DEFENSE Investors had sold defense stocks thinking that a victory by the Democrats could mean cuts in military spending. But experts say Pentagon outlays will keep up their spectacular growth for at least two years, regardless of Tuesday\\'s outcome. In the run-up to the elections, Pentagon suppliers\\' shares took a small beating. In the past two weeks, the Standard & Poor\\'s Aerospace and Defense index .GSPAERO had dipped nearly 4 percent from a record high on October 16, while the S&P 500 moved higher. \"If you look at what they\\'re (the Democrats) saying, and if they can get these things to pass, I would imagine you\\'re going to see the defense sector weaken. They\\'re talking about how they can exit Iraq sooner,\" said Jim Huguet, president and co-chief executive of Great Companies Inc., which oversees about $400 million, primarily in equities.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) slipped on Wednesday as some investors worried that big political wins by Democrats could bring higher payroll costs and derail the retailer\\'s efforts to open a bank. \\n\\n Democrats took control of the U.S. House of Representatives in Tuesday\\'s election and were on the brink of taking the Senate. Analysts widely expect a minimum wage hike to be high on the list of priorities for the next Congress. This would be both good and bad for Wal-Mart, the world\\'s biggest retailer and largest U.S. private-sector employer. While a higher minimum wage may increase labor costs, it would also put more money in the pockets of Wal-Mart\\'s core lower-income shoppers. ThinkEquity Partners analyst Edward Weller pointed out that a higher minimum wage would affect far more customers than workers. \"It is not at all clear to us that anything much would change about market share or profitability,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"We would guess that most, if not all, moderate-priced retailers would see payroll pressures of the same order of magnitude, and generally speaking, it would not change Wal-Mart\\'s low-cost competitive position,\" he said. Wal-Mart became a political target this election year, with key Democrats accusing the company of providing inadequate wages and benefits while earning billions of dollars in profit. The retailer, which has been a heavy contributor to the Republican party, launched a voter registration drive and provided election information to its 1.3 million employees. Wal-Mart spokesman David Tovar said the retailer thinks the federal minimum wage should be increased from the current $5.15, but it was up to Congress to decide how much. The retailer\\'s average full-time hourly wage is $10.11. It has not disclosed the average wage for part-time workers. BANKING, HEALTH CARE Chris Kofinis, spokesman for WakeUpWalMart.com, which has pressured Wal-Mart to improve pay and benefits, said the retailer could expect more scrutiny on hot-button issues, including health care and banking. \"This is a company that is going to face a seriously different political environment, which means a lot of the terrible things they\\'ve been able to get away with over the last 12 years are now going to face serious inspection and oversight,\" Kofinis said. Wal-Mart\\'s Tovar said the retailer was a \"bipartisan company, and we partner with elected leaders from both sides of the aisle. \"We find the doors open to us across the political spectrum when we share the good things we are doing as a company to make a difference in America, like environmental sustainability, providing $4 generic drugs, job creation, and the millions of dollars that we give to local charitable organizations.\" Voters tossed out the Republican governor of Maryland, who had sided with Wal-Mart against legislation that would require the retailer to spend more on health care. The Maryland legislature overrode Gov. Robert Ehrlich\\'s veto, but a judge struck down the law in July. Other states have considered similar legislation, and politicians may be emboldened after Democrats won a majority of U.S. governors\\' offices for the first time since 1994. Wal-Mart is one of several companies seeking permission to operate a bank known as an industrial loan corporation. The company has said it wanted to process credit card transactions, but opponents worry that it has bigger banking ambitions. Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank, who is set to take control of the House Financial Services Committee, has said he wanted federal banking regulators to extend a moratorium on industrial loan corporations. Tovar said the bank bid should be approved, noting that similar applications were approved for some 60 other firms. Wal-Mart shares edged down 39 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $47.26 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Independent power producer Dynegy Inc. ( DYN.N ) on Wednesday posted a third-quarter net loss as charges related to a write-down of a Kentucky power plant cut into gains in its Midwest operations. \\n\\n The company, which will spend more than $2 billion to buy power plants from private equity fund LS Power Group, said the net loss applicable to common stockholders was $69 million, or 14 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $23 million, or 6 cents per share. Excluding special charges, Dynegy, which provides power to the Midwest, Northeast and South, earned 6 cents per share, falling short of analysts\\' average forecast of 10 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 24.5 percent to $581 million from $770 million. With the purchase of the LS Power plants, Dynegy\\'s generating capacity will jump to 20,000 megawatts from nearly 13,000 MW currently. Daniele Seitz, an analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co, said the quarter was weaker than expected because \"power prices crashed pretty quickly toward the end of the quarter.\" But the company benefited from improved margins and lower interest costs, said Seitz, who has a \"buy\" rating on Dynegy. Average market prices for power declined nearly 30 percent from the year-earlier period, President Steve Furbacher told a conference call. The company\\'s net volume, or the sales volume of generated power, fell 20 percent, pushed down by planned production outages and reduced operations. These were somewhat offset by stronger realized prices in the Midwest due to existing contracts and by benefits from unrealized gains in its hedge portfolio. Shares of Dynegy were down 21 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $6.01 in early morning trading in the New York Stock Exchange. CHARGES WEIGH The Houston-based company said current results included $98 million in special after-tax charges. These items included a $61 million write-down of the value of its Bluegrass peaking plant and a $23 million charge related to a debt exchange. The Houston company also took a $14 million charge as part of a $44 million payment to Enron Corp. to settle outstanding claims dating back to 2001 with the now-defunct power trader. Dynegy, which backed out of a planned purchase of Enron in the weeks before Enron\\'s collapse into bankruptcy, underwent a management change and restructuring that enabled it to avoid financial ruin in the wake of the power markets collapse of 2001-2002. Dynegy cut the forecast for 2006 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its power generation business to between $475 million and $505 million from $570 million to $630 million. That would bring its expected net loss applicable to common shareholders to $305 million to $325 million versus the previous forecast of a loss of $215 million to $260 million.

       "  ' HANOI  (Reuters) - Intel Corp., the world\\'s largest chip maker, is to more than treble its investment in building two plants in Vietnam to $1 billion, sources familiar with the firm\\'s plan said on Wednesday. \\n\\n \"The license for the increased investment to $1 billion will be handed to Intel on Friday,\" said a source close to the management board of Saigon High-Tech Park, where Intel\\'s Vietnam unit is building its first plant. When licensed in February for an initial investment of $300 million, Intel\\'s project to package and test microchips that power personal computers and mobile phones was the biggest investment in Vietnam by a U.S. company. Vietnam, which has one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies after China, became the newest member of the World Trade Organization on Tuesday and many economic analysts expect investment to increase. Next week, the Communist-run country\\'s thriving economy will be on show when Hanoi hosts the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders\\' week, with hundreds of company executives attending. A second source familiar with the deal said that initially, California-based Intel had an option to build a second phase for its plant that would double the investment to $605 million. \"But now it wanted to bring the investment up to $1 billion in the second phase,\" said the source, who declined to be identified due to a lack of authorization to give details. Intel Products Vietnam said in an invitation received by Reuters that Intel Deputy Chairman Brian Krzanich would announce the new investment level at a ceremony in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\\'s commercial center, on Friday. In February, Intel Chairman Craig Barret said production at the Vietnam plant, its seventh in the world, would start in the second half of 2007. RISING INTEREST Industry officials say the Intel project would help Vietnam draw foreign investors, including those in related businesses. \"The attraction of U.S. group Intel to invest in the high-tech park,\" the park\\'s board said in a statement, \"immediately created an attractive force to many companies and partners to survey on investment opportunity at the park\". Vietnam\\'s technology sector is relatively small, but the country has become the world\\'s top producer of robusta coffee and black pepper, the second-largest rice exporter and Southeast Asia\\'s third-biggest crude oil producer. The International Monetary Fund said in its annual review of Vietnam\\'s economy published on Tuesday that WTO membership would create opportunities for expanding non-oil exports and foreign direct investment, a big driver of the economy. This year, pledges are expected to rise 19 percent from 2005 to $6.6 billion despite graft and lack of transparency in auditing and information.',\n",

The announcement came as 3M announced separately that it had\\nagreed to sell its pharmaceutical operations across the world to\\nvarious buyers. Meda shares rose sharply on the news and were up\\n11.6 percent at 212 crowns by 1041 GMT.  \"It (the division) fits like a glove. We were extremely\\nhappy when we saw this opportunity, \" Meda Chief Executive\\nAnders Lonner told Reuters.  Meda said the 3M division had sales of about 2 billion\\ncrowns and 330 employees. It said the acquisition would\\nstrengthen its position in key markets such as cardiovascular,\\ndermatology and oncology drugs.  \"It is a good acquisition at a good price, and with good\\nsynergies from the looks of it,\" said HQ Bank analyst Jesper\\nNorberg. Meda said it expected the acquisition to result in\\nannual cost savings of more than 150 million crowns.  The Swedish firm, which had sales of 3.9 billion crowns in\\nthe first nine months of the year, said it would finance the\\nacquisition with bank loans and a new share issue worth 1.8\\nbillion crowns, which it will then use to repay some of the\\nloans.  Meda said the acquired pharmaceutical portfolio included\\nthree specialist products used to fight skin diseases, cardiac\\narrhythmia and angina pectoris.  During the last two years Meda has bought product rights to\\ndrugs from companies such as Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) and\\nNovartis ( NOVN.VX ).   It has a track record of big acquisitions. In 2005 it bought\\nGermany\\'s Viatris for 750 million euros, a company with more\\nthan double its own sales at the time, and nine times as many\\nemployees.  Since the acquisition of Viatris, Meda\\'s shares have more\\nthan tripled in value as it has successfully integrated that\\ncompany and sharply increased profitability.  Instead of developing entirely new drugs from scratch, Meda\\nacquires or signs license agreements for existing products.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The group cautioned that it could incur additional\\nprovisions tied to losses on a large outsourcing contract with\\nelectrical equipment supplier Schneider ( SCHN.PA ) but it\\ninsisted this did not threaten its full-year goals.  By 1152 GMT, Capgemini shares -- which have gained 37\\npercent since the start of the year -- were off 2.4 percent at\\n45.68 euros, underperforming a 0.3 percent rise in the European\\nsector index .SX8P.  \"Overall it\\'s positive but good news has been largely\\nfactored in the share price,\" Fideuram Wargny analyst Lionel\\nPellicer said.  Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Dufourcq said consensus on\\n2006 operating margins was 5.64 to 5.7 percent. \"We will be\\nwithin that consensus but not above it,\" he told a conference\\ncall.  The group had forecast a margin of above 5.5 percent for\\n2006 against 3.2 percent in 2005.  \"The third-quarter was extremely strong and the\\nfourth-quarter is looking good... So our target of 10 percent\\n(revenue growth) becomes 11 percent,\" Dufourcq said.  Last month Capgemini pre-released its third-quarter revenues\\nalong with news it would buy technology services group Kanbay\\nInternational KBAY.O for $1.25 billion.  Third-quarter sales rose a forecast-beating 12.4 percent to\\n1.881 billion euros ($2.40 billion). Like-for-like sales growth\\nwas 13.5 percent, with outsourcing up 20 percent. Outsourcing\\naccounted for 41 percent of group revenue in the quarter.  \\n  HALF-WAY ON OUTSOURCING MARGIN PLAN  A year ago, Capgemini launched a three-year plan to bolster\\nits outsourcing division margin. Although a strong contributor\\nto revenue growth, outsourcing has suffered from start-up costs\\nof several large contracts, including the Schneider contract.  Chief Executive Officer Paul Hermelin said the plan was on\\ntrack and that Capgemini was confident it would reach its\\n4-percent operating margin target for the division in 2006.  This would put Capgemini half-way to its goal to reach a\\ndivisional margin of 8 percent by the end of the plan.  For 2007, Capgemini targets an operating margin for the\\ndivision of 5 to 5.5 percent, including the Schneider contract,\\nand of more than 7.5 percent excluding Schneider.  These targets -- which Capgemini calls the divisional margin\\n-- are before corporate costs and other administrative expenses.  \"We have proven the benefits of a great year one of a three\\nyear programme. If we have the same progress in 2007, which I am\\nexpecting, we should be able to say business as usual, let\\'s\\nmove on,\" outsourcing chief Paul Spence told Reuters.  The plan includes changing the business mix towards more\\nvalue-added offerings, renegotiating some contracts with clients\\nor suppliers, rebalancing outsourcing contracts between large\\nand smaller-sized deals and focusing more on mid-sized deals.  It also includes cost-savings at production sites worldwide\\nand on support functions, speeding up outsourcing outside North\\nAmerica to India and reducing purchasing spending and the use of\\ncontractors.  Capgemini had said the plan would cost about 70 million\\neuros in 2006, a figure Hermelin confirmed during the call. It\\nis expected to cost around 35 million euros in 2007.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The company said it had achieved 85 percent of its revenue and cost savings target of $3 billion by the end of the quarter and plans to exit Chapter 11 in the first half of 2007. \"It points clearly to their progress,\" said Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant. \"They are on a dead run to get out of Chapter 11.\" Delta, the No. 3 U.S. carrier, reported a net profit in the third quarter of $52 million, compared with a net loss of $1.13 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding a net noncash gain of $98 million related to reorganization, the carrier posted a loss of $46 million. In the year ago quarter, the company posted a loss of $438 million excluding special items. Total operating revenue in the third quarter increased 8.1 percent to $4.66 billion. Fuel costs increased 3.2 percent to $1.24 billion. As of October 31, Delta said it had hedged 71 percent of its planned fuel consumption for the fourth quarter and expected its average fuel price for the quarter to be $2.03 per gallon. Delta said it had $3.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, of which $2.8 billion was unrestricted.

       "  ' TURIN, Italy  (Reuters) - Italian industrial group Fiat ( FIA.MI ) laid out ambitious growth and profit targets for its core Fiat Auto business on Thursday, mapping out a plan to extend the division\\'s earnings rebound through 2010. \\n\\n But its stock fell when Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, architect of Fiat\\'s escape from crisis, said he intended to let someone else run Fiat Auto next year while he remained at the helm of the group. \"I think I\\'ll do it in 2007 and I think there\\'s enough talent in the group,\" he told analysts at a presentation of the group\\'s 2007-2010 strategy at its head offices in Turin. \"I won\\'t hire anyone from outside the company.\" He said he would still follow Fiat Auto\\'s progress closely. Marchionne said the group -- which also makes trucks, tractors and construction equipment -- expected to earn net income of between 3.4 billion and 3.6 billion euros on revenue of 67 billion euros in 2010. He said he favored share buybacks as long as earnings per share rose and the group could maintain a strong balance sheet. Fiat shares, which have been the best-performing stock this year in the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP, fell 1.7 percent to 14.95 euros by 1203 GMT while the index eased 0.7 percent. JP Morgan analyst Philippe Houchois said investors were likely to be taking profits following the stock\\'s strong rise in the days ahead of the presentation. Marchionne told investors he would consider a strategic deal with another carmaker but no such transaction was imminent. \"If one of the options in the medium to long term is an association with another (carmaker) that would guarantee the future (of Fiat Auto) we will look at it,\" he said, adding at this stage it was \"foolish to speculate\" on such a transaction. For 2010, Marchionne set a revenue target of 32.5 billion euros for the Fiat Auto division from 19.5 billion euros in 2005. No estimate was given for 2006. For the division\\'s trading profit margin, he aimed for 4.5-5.3 percent in 2010 from an expected 0.8-1.3 percent for 2006. Fiat raised Fiat Auto\\'s 2006 operating profit target to 275 million euros excluding one-off items from 250 million. Marchionne said Fiat Auto looked to increase its market share in western Europe to over 11 percent by 2010 from around 8 percent this year, adding its global new car registrations would rise to 3.5 million units by 2010 from 2.12 million in 2006. The forecasts exclude Fiat\\'s light commercial vehicles business, while registrations include cars made by joint ventures. The Fiat Auto division aims to launch 23 new models by 2010 as it fuels profitable growth. Both its Lancia premium brand and sporty Alfa Romeo brands set sales targets of 300,000 units. Since a major restructuring overseen by Marchionne and the launch of new models like the Grande Punto, the division has had some of the strongest sales growth among European auto manufacturers this year. Fiat Auto stands to make good money once its production volume reaches 2.8 million units a year, Marchionne said. \"The way to make money here is to increase utilization of the infrastructure. We start making decent money when we start doing about 2.8 million cars,\" he said.',\n",

The second-largest U.S. automaker, which posted a third-quarter loss of $5.8 billion, plans to close 16 plants and slash nearly 45,000 jobs. It is offering buyouts to about 75,000 union workers as part of its restructuring. Ford in October said it would cut North American production by as much as 12 percent in the first six months of 2007. The production cut at the Wayne plant, which makes the Ford Expedition and Lincoln navigator SUVs, is in addition to the previously announced cuts. \"We see the overall volumes in the segment declining,\" Gattari said. \"And we will be able to meet the demand with one shift.\" Expedition sales have fallen nearly 30 percent this year, while Navigator sales have slipped almost 15 percent. The plant is Ford\\'s largest in Michigan, with about 2,800 workers. The automaker said it was too early to tell how many jobs would be lost as a result of the cut.',\n",

( F.N ) said on Thursday it was delaying the filing of its quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission while the company completes a restatement of past results. \\n\\n Ford said last month it would restate results from 2001 to the second quarter of this year because of an accounting change related to interest-rate swaps that were taken out to hedge against the company\\'s long-term debt. Ford, which plans to close 16 plants and cut nearly 45,000 jobs to adjust to its sliding share of the U.S. auto market, said it planned to file its report for the third-quarter with the SEC by Tuesday. A company spokeswoman declined further comment. Ford posted a preliminary net loss of $5.8 billion for the third quarter, compared with a loss of $284 million as originally reported for the same period a year earlier. \"While the restatement process is not yet complete, we do anticipate changes, in some cases significant, in prior period results,\" Ford said in a filing on Thursday with the SEC, announcing the delay in its quarterly report.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT.N, the largest U.S. tire maker, on Thursday posted better-than-expected quarterly results on higher prices and sales of more expensive tires, sending its shares up as much as 17 percent. \\n\\n Goodyear, contending with a five-week-old strike by the United Steelworkers union in North America, revealed details of its latest contract offer, said it hoped to resume talks and remained committed to cutting North American production. The union said in a statement it was \"pleased that the possibility of a different tone for our talks exists\" and it would be prepared to resume talks if Goodyear abandoned plans to close plants covered by its contract and would fully fund proposed changes to retiree health care  . Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan said Goodyear\\'s third-quarter results were solid, noting the company\\'s strategy of cutting back on sales of low-profit private-label replacement tires and concentrating on sales of more expensive Goodyear brand tires. \"The hard work is ahead in terms of reducing capacity and aligning their cost structure in North America,\" Tynan added. \"The strike, depending on how it plays out, will obviously be crucial to the company\\'s cost structure.\" Excluding restructuring charges, a gain from a settlement with a supplier, and accelerated depreciation, Goodyear earned 42 cents per share in the quarter. Analysts\\' average forecast was 24 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 5 percent to $5.28 billion, topping analysts\\' average forecast of $5.25 billion. Goodyear posted a net loss of $48 million, or 27 cents per share, for the quarter. Raw materials costs rose 17 percent, or $249 million, but may have peaked, Goodyear said. Materials such as steel cord, natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and fabric make up about 35 percent of the cost of goods sold. Volume fell 4.5 percent to 55.8 million tires worldwide as Goodyear cut back on the private-label tire business. But revenue generated from each tire rose 8 percent. In North America, sales rose 2.6 percent to $2.43 billion, but operating income fell to $19 million from $58 million a year earlier, reflecting weak consumer replacement demand, reduced private-label tire production, and higher costs. European Union unit sales rose 11.7 percent to $1.26 billion, and operating income rose $1 million to $81 million. In the fourth quarter, Goodyear said it expects market conditions in North America to continue to improve, largely on declining gasoline prices. It also expects continued strong winter tire sales in Europe due to early snow there. STRIKE IMPACT About 15,000 union workers at 16 Goodyear plants in the United States and Canada went on strike October 5 after rejecting the latest contract proposal from the Akron, Ohio-based company. The union opposes closing any plants, while Goodyear has said that in order to be competitive, it must cut a Tyler, Texas, plant covered by the union master agreement. The company has proposed protecting all other contract plants. Goodyear said it was losing $30 million to $35 million a week in operating income early in the strike, but losses are expected to ease as more production comes back on line. The company is using salaried and temporary workers for production at struck plants, has increased output at nonunion plants, and plans to bring in more tires from plants abroad. Present North American production is not quite half of pre-strike levels. Goodyear plans to cut more than $1 billion of costs through 2008 by closing high-cost plants, buying more materials from low-cost countries, and reducing other expenses. Goodyear\\'s contract summary included details on benefits, job security, a proposed $660 million contribution to create a trust fund for retiree health care, and minimum investment of $447 million to master contract plants. Shares of Goodyear were up $2.42 at $17.59 on the New York Stock Exchange and reached $17.75 earlier, the highest level since late January. Before Thursday, the shares had risen more than 6 percent since the day before the strike began.',\n",

Lenovo\\'s global business should stay weak for the foreseeable future -- in the fiscal second quarter, shipments in second-largest market the United States slid 9 percent -- as the company faces difficulty gaining brand recognition among consumers outside of its Asian stronghold, analysts said. It has been grappling with expenses arising from the US$1.25 billion purchase of IBM\\'s PC arm, amid competition from bigger rivals Dell Inc. DELL.O and Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ): a burden that should persist into coming quarters, analysts said. And, like its rivals, it might have to contend with slower global PC shipment growth in 2006 and 2007. The firm, one of an increasing number of Chinese corporations trying to craft a global brand, earned US$38 million in the second fiscal quarter ended September, versus US$45.2 million a year ago, according to Reuters\\' calculations off previously reported data. That followed a sharp fourth-quarter loss and a slim US$5 million first-quarter profit. Lenovo vastly underperformed Acer Inc.\\'s ( 2353.TW ) 6 percent earnings dip over the same period. Its second-quarter result lagged a consensus forecast for a net profit of HK$335.3 million ($43.08 million), according to six analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. \"The result is disappointing,\" said Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Chuang. \"They just booked a $2 million restructuring cost so I expect more to come in the following quarters, and competition is a problem.\" \"In terms of valuation, Lenovo is a lot more expensive (than rivals). There\\'re better choices out there.\" For further first-half earnings details, please click  here HOME TEAM Executives argued on Thursday that the benefits of a post-IBM overhaul encompassing job cuts and costing some $100 million should begin to show up in the second half, adding that they would not book related charges after the current fiscal year. \"The next step of improvement won\\'t come from just synergies or job cuts, but a turnaround of our overseas business... fundamentally improving our product structure, sales model and competitiveness,\" Chairman Yang Yuanqing told reporters. \"Reform is a painful experience and needs patience.\" Turnover edged 1.3 percent higher to about $3.7 billion in the fiscal second quarter. \"Revenue is very much in line with my expectations, it\\'s just the net profit\" that is disappointing, said a JP Morgan analyst. Asian technology shares rose on Thursday in the wake of better-than-expected quarterly profit at Cisco Systems ( CSCO.O ). Lenovo\\'s shares had gained nearly 4 percent on Thursday morning. Shares of the company -- the worst performer in Hong Kong\\'s blue-chip Hang Seng Index  .HSI  until September, when the firm was dropped from the benchmark gauge -- have recovered since posting better-than-expected first-quarter results.

But its stock now trades at a lofty 26 times prospective earnings, versus Acer\\'s 13 and HP\\'s 18, according to Reuters Estimates. Despite strength on its home turf -- Lenovo commands over a third of the Chinese PC market, the world\\'s largest after the United States -- the firm is struggling to expand beyond Asia and ranks a distant third to Dell and HP with a near-8 percent global market share.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and gave a strong outlook on Wednesday as Internet traffic growth boosted orders for network equipment, pushing its shares up 7.5 percent. \\n\\n Scientific Atlanta, the cable set-top box maker it bought in February, also showed strong sales growth, validating Cisco\\'s expansion into the consumer market from its traditional business of making routers and switches. Fiscal first-quarter revenue rose 25 percent to $8.2 billion, with Scientific Atlanta contributing $584 million. Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected $7.9 billion in revenue, according to Reuters Estimates. \"It\\'s a very impressive quarter. I think there was certainly some expectation for upside and they delivered considerable upside,\" said Erik Suppiger, an analyst at Pacific Growth Securities. Chief Executive John Chambers told analysts on a conference call he expected second-quarter revenue growth of 24 percent to 25 percent over a year ago, or 14 percent to 15 percent growth excluding Scientific Atlanta. The market consensus forecast had been for second-quarter revenue growth of about 21 percent. First-quarter profit before special items rose to $1.9 billion, or 31 cents per share, from $1.6 billion, or 25 cents per share, a year ago. That beat the average analyst forecast of 29 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. YOUTUBE AND IPTV Chambers said a key growth driver was telecommunications and cable service providers upgrading networks to handle rising consumer demand for Web-based video, such as on YouTube.com. Phone companies launching Internet-based TV services, or IPTV, are also bolstering sales, he said. Orders from U.S. service providers grew about 30 percent. \"I think the deployment of IPTV and next-generation carrier networks is going to be a pretty strong market opportunity for Cisco,\" Pacific Growth\\'s Suppiger said. Cisco has expanded into the consumer video market in the past few years. Besides Scientific Atlanta, it has also bought video-on-demand software maker Arroyo Video Solutions and launched a high-definition video conferencing system, TelePresence. Analysts say it was important for Cisco to diversify as phone carriers are merging, a trend that could eventually lead to slower spending on network equipment. But Cisco said it did not see much of an impact of such consolidation so far, with first-quarter revenues for routers up 13 percent and switches up 15 percent year-over-year. Analysts said there also appeared to be no impact from a recent slowdown in the U.S. economy. \"It\\'s hard to tell how the slower overall economy is impacting them when their results are so strong,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management. Chambers said balanced geographic growth was helping, with orders from emerging markets up more than 40 percent. He expected sales to Japan, a key market that is starting to build next-generation networks, to gain momentum this quarter. Having closed at $25.10 on Nasdaq, Cisco shares rose in extended trade to $26.99, a level not seen since early 2004. The stock has risen 50 percent in 2006, compared to a 6 percent rise in the Nasdaq 100 and a 16 percent fall in rival equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc. Cisco also said it had repurchased 66 million shares of common stock at an average price of $22.85 for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion during the quarter.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc.\\'s ( CSCO.O ) strong results suggest that rising consumer demand for Internet video and phone services is helping to offset slower spending by phone carriers as they merge, analysts said on Thursday. \\n\\n Cisco and other network equipment makers may now have fewer clients due to consolidation, but orders for routers and switches remain strong as phone and cable providers upgrade their networks to cope with bandwidth-heavy services. The rising popularity of online video entertainment, such as the popular YouTube.com, as well as Web-based calling services, helped Cisco post a 25 percent jump in fiscal first quarter revenue on Wednesday. \"Everyone was afraid of consolidation, and that it was going to hurt capital spending. But things are clearly moving in the opposite direction for Cisco,\" said Kenneth Muth at Robert W. Baird & Co. Cisco\\'s shares rose 6.4 percent to close at $26.71 on Thursday, and shares of other telecommunication equipment makers also rose. Smaller rival Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR.O, for example, gained 5.1 percent to $19.65. While some investors are betting that the telecoms equipment sector is more resilient than expected, analysts warned that Cisco is taking market share from rivals like Juniper and Lucent Technologies Inc. LU.N. \"Cisco (is) continuing to gain wallet share of overall IT spending... we believe end users are beginning to adopt Cisco\\'s converged network product strategy,\" A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Aaron Rakers said in a report. Even as companies like AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) merge with smaller carriers, Cisco said its sales to U.S. service providers rose 30 percent year-on-year in the quarter ended October 28. The growth was driven in part by strong sales of CRS-1, a high-capacity core router. CRS-1 orders rose 500 percent from a year ago to $150 million, the company said. Looking ahead, analysts said the recent launch of Internet-based television services, called \"Internet protocol television (IPTV), by phone carriers would further drive Cisco\\'s sales in coming years. Both AT&T and Verizon have launched such services, which feature high-definition video and various downloading options, bundling them with their phone and Internet services to compete with similar services offered by cable providers. In addition, analysts said Cisco\\'s strength in overseas markets would likely help the company weather any impact from a slower U.S. economy. Japan is seen as being particularly crucial in the coming year as the country starts to build next-generation networks. Analysts also said Cisco\\'s acquisition of cable set-top box maker Scientific Atlanta was another source of its strong growth and reflects the company\\'s expansion into the consumer market from its business of making routers and switches. For the second quarter, Cisco said it expected year-on-year revenue growth of 24 percent to 25 percent, or 14 percent to 15 percent excluding Scientific Atlanta. \"Cisco seems to be gleaning even more benefit from the Scientific Atlanta acquisition than we envisioned,\" said Ehud Gelblum, analyst at JP Morgan Research.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) shares rose as much as 9 percent on Thursday after the leading network equipment maker reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results and gave an upbeat forecast for the current period. \\n\\n The stock was up $1.82, or 7.3 percent, at $26.92 in early Nasdaq trade after rising to $27.44, its highest level since January 2004. After Wednesday\\'s market close, the company said profit before special items rose to $1.9 billion, or 31 cents per share, in the first quarter ended on October 28 from $1.6 billion, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. That beat the analysts\\' average forecast of 29 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates, and prompted several analysts to upgrade their views on the stock. Chief Executive John Chambers had also forecast second-quarter revenue growth of 24 percent to 25 percent from a year earlier, saying the company was enjoying broad-based growth, including at its traditional routers and switches business and its cable set-top box unit Scientific-Atlanta. Banc of America raised its price target on Cisco to $30 from $27, reiterating a \"buy\" rating. Prudential Equity Group raised its target price to $26 from $24, and reiterated an \"overweight\" rating. \"We believe Cisco continues to gain share in its core markets, while also building a meaningful, and increasingly dominant, presence in new markets, such as video and IP communications,\" Prudential Equity analyst Inder Singh said in a report. \"Given their recent momentum, and Cisco\\'s strong results this quarter, we would not be surprised to see shares trade above our price target over the remainder of calendar 2006,\" he said. However, he added that he was wary of applying a higher valuation as the stock had already rallied strongly this year. Cisco shares have risen nearly 60 percent since the start of the year, compared with a 7 percent rise in the Nasdaq 100 .NDX and a 11 percent fall in Juniper Networks JNPR.O. Juniper shares rose nearly 6 percent in early trade to $19.76, helped by Cisco\\'s news.',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment weakened slightly in early November, a report showed on Thursday, as consumers scaled back their view of their current and future financial conditions. \\n\\n The declines in the latest survey\\'s readings were small but just enough to cast worries on how consumers would spend during the holiday shopping season. \"This is in-line with what we are looking at with the retailers and it confirms the weakness on the retail side,\" said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates in Hinsdale, Illinois. The University of Michigan\\'s preliminary reading on consumer sentiment in November was 92.3, down from October\\'s reading of 93.6, said sources who saw the subscription-only report. The median forecast of Wall Street economists polled by Reuters was for a reading of 93.6. Falling gasoline prices have brightened consumer mood but not enough to elevate them again in early November, economists said. Retail gasoline prices averaged $2.23 a gallon last week, 3.5 cents lower than a week earlier and 50 cents below a year ago, the Energy Information Administration said earlier this week. The University of Michigan survey\\'s index of current conditions slipped to 106.5 in early November from 107.3 in October, while consumer expectations dipped to 83.2 from 84.8 in October. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, but in recent years confidence measures have been a weak guide to actual spending. Consumers\\' expectations for increased inflation fell in early November the report said, according to the sources. The University of Michigan\\'s preliminary November reading on one-year U.S. inflation expectations was 3.0 percent, down from 3.1 percent in October. Median expectations for inflation over a five-year horizon fell to 3.0 percent from 3.1 percent in October.',\n",

Wholesale inventories were led by gains in unsold stocks of durable goods, which rose by 1.5 percent during the month. Inventories of nondurable goods, such as food and apparel, fell 0.4 percent, the Commerce Department said. Inventories of automobiles jumped 1.9 percent to $37.34 billion in September after a 0.9 percent August decline. Overall wholesale sales fell by 1.2 percent in September, its first decline since November 2005 and its largest since April 2003. Sales were up 0.7 percent in August. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a gauge of how long it would take to deplete existing stocks at the current sales pace, rose to 1.18 months' worth in September. That was after hitting 1.16 months' in August and was the highest level in more than a year. Overall sales were dragged down by a 7.1 percent drop in petroleum during September after a 2.8 percent decline in August. However, the value of petroleum inventories rose 2.4 percent to $10.44 billion.\",\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than expected in September as oil import prices fell, and U.S. consumer sentiment weakened slightly early this month, according to data on Thursday. \\n\\n Taken together, the two reports sent mixed signals on the U.S. economy, and did little to change the market outlook for monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. The Commerce Department said the U.S. trade gap totaled $64.3 billion in September, below Wall Street expectations for a $66 billion shortfall and down 6.8 percent from August. The University of Michigan\\'s preliminary reading on consumer sentiment in November was 92.3, down from October\\'s 93.6, said sources who saw the subscription-only report. The median forecast of Wall Street economists polled by Reuters was for a reading of 93.6. The dollar rose after the trade data but then slipped against the euro after the weaker-than-expected sentiment index. U.S. blue chip stocks also rose on the trade data, but then headed lower as oil futures prices rose and technology shares pared earlier gains. U.S. government debt prices edged up because the Michigan data hinted at ebbing inflation. OIL IMPORT PRICES DOWN Oil import prices fell for the first time in five months to $62.52 per barrel in September from $66.12 in August, as the U.S. summer driving season came to a close and oil inventories rose. The volume of oil imports also declined in September. However, the modest improvement in the deficit was not taken as signal of a trend of narrower deficits. \"The improvement was attributable to a decline in the price and volume of oil imported, while the trade deficit with China widened again -- in the months ahead, oil imports will increase, and new record trade deficits will be set,\" said Peter Morici, economist and professor at the University of Maryland\\'s Robert H. Smith School of Business. Other analysts said the trade numbers could prompt the Commerce Department to raise its reading of third quarter U.S. economic growth. \"The number is going to add $4 billion to $5 billion to the third-quarter GDP in the next revision,\" putting growth at an annual rate of 1.8 percent from 1.6 percent originally reported, predicted Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. A second government report suggested falling oil prices could continue to help narrow the trade gap. U.S. import prices fell 2 percent in October, or twice as much as analysts expected, due mainly to an 8.3 percent drop in petroleum prices, a Labor Department report showed. DEFICIT WITH CHINA GROWS Imports of high-technology products rose to a record $26.2 billion and imports from China increased 3.3 percent to a record $27.6 billion. The trade deficit with China also widened 4.6 percent to a record $23.0 billion. The year-to-date trade deficit with China totaled $166.3 billion, keeping it on a pace to easily surpass last year\\'s record of $202 billion. Also, the number of U.S. workers applying for jobless benefits fell to 308,000 last week, according to data on Thursday. Data from the Commerce Department showed inventories at U.S. wholesalers rose by a larger-than-expected 0.8 percent in September, while sales fell for the first time in nearly a year. Analysts polled by Reuters projected wholesale inventories -- unsold stocks held by U.S. businesses or companies for resale to retailers -- to rise 0.5 percent after a 1.2 percent August gain.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ), the world\\'s largest insurer by market value, said on Thursday net income more than doubled in the third quarter, making it the latest insurer to benefit from the absence of hurricanes this year. \\n\\n The company also beat analysts\\' expectations by 10 cents a share, sending its shares higher in aftermarket trading. \"AIG rode the same wave as the rest of the property casualty industry,\" said Donald Light, an analyst with Celent  LLC. One of AIG\\'s four major lines of business is property casualty, where the company suffered $1.6 billion in losses last year as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast. This year, there were no significant catastrophes, the company said. AIG said net income was $4.22 billion, or $1.61 a share, in the third quarter, up from $1.75 billion, or 66 cents a share, in the year earlier quarter. \"AIG doesn\\'t disappoint very much,\" said Matt Nellans, an insurance analyst with Morningstar. Its ratio of premiums to losses and expenses for the first nine months improved by 4 percentage points, even without including the negative effect of the hurricanes in the year ago period. Life insurance premium income rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter. Life insurance policyholder contracts were $7 billion in the first nine months of the year, a steady source of fee income, Nellans said. A FEW NEGATIVES There were a few negatives. In its domestic retirement services, net flows were negative, meaning people took money out. Individual fixed annuities, contracts based on the bond market, had slow sales, AIG said. \"Market conditions in Japan remain challenging due to increased competition,\" AIG Chief Executive Martin Sullivan said in his statement, a trend that had started earlier this year. But he said AIG was lining up products in anticipation of a full deregulation of the Japanese market. \"Everyone breathed a sigh of relief that there were no special charges,\" said Cathy Seifert, an insurance analyst with S&P Equity Research. \"It sounds like they are getting back to their old style of business, although they are not immune to macro-competitive pressures.\" New York City-based AIG, which also has a financial services unit that specializes in aircraft leasing and an asset management unit, said adjusted net earnings were $4.02 billion, or $1.53 a share. Analysts, on average had expected the insurer to earn $1.43 a share, according to Reuters estimates. Adjusted net excludes realized capital gains and losses and accounting for hedging activities. In the year ago quarter, AIG had adjusted net income of $1.86 billion, or 71 cents a share. In aftermarket trading, AIG\\'s shares initially rose as much as 1.7 percent and are currently trading at $68.50, up from its close of $68.04. Since the start of the year, AIG\\'s shares have been trading about flat at $68, compared with a 4.6 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\\'s insurance index. But AIG\\'s stock fell to a year low of $57.52 in July and then began to recover in August after second quarter earnings beat analyst expectations. It trades at a price to earnings multiple of 11.8, a slight premium to a group of similar insurers. Other insurers have also beaten estimates because of lower catastrophe losses. These include Chubb Corp. ( CB.N ) and Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. ( HIG.N ).',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumers will share in a $336 million settlement of a lawsuit accusing several banks and credit card groups of conspiring to charge excessive fees on foreign currency transactions, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday. \\n\\n The settlement covers holders of U.S.-issued MasterCard or Visa credit cards or debit cards, and Diners Club credit cards who made foreign transactions from February 1, 1996 to the present. Tens of thousands of cardholders, including companies whose employees travel internationally, may recover money. Judge William Pauley of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan said the class-action settlement appeared to be the result of serious negotiations by experienced counsel, and was \"fair, reasonable and adequate.\" Defendants in the five-year-old case include credit card groups Visa and MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ), as well as Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ) and several affiliates. Cardholders accused them of colluding to fix charges and of poor disclosure. \"Every time you go overseas, you would be charged 1 percent by Visa or MasterCard and another 2 or 3 percent by your bank to convert a transaction into U.S. dollars,\" said Patrick Coughlin, a partner at Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP in San Francisco, who represented the plaintiffs. \"The cost (to defendants) to do these transactions was about one-quarter of 1 percent,\" he said. Citigroup spokesman Samuel Wang said the settlement avoids the uncertainty of litigation, and that the bank\\'s portion was covered by existing reserves. HSBC spokesman Stephen Cohen declined to comment. Visa spokeswoman Rhonda Bentz said the card association was pleased that the judge approved the settlement. Washington Mutual spokesman Alan Elias said the settlement was not a material issue for the company. Other defendants did not immediately return requests for comment. Coughlin said one benefit of the litigation was that card issuers now break out currency charges as a separate item on customer bills. \"This makes banks competitive in setting those charges,\" he said. Lawyers for the plaintiffs had announced a pending settlement in July. Pauley\\'s approval is preliminary, and carries several conditions. A hearing to enter a final judgment was set for November 2, 2007.',\n",

The circumstances entitled him to more than $44.4 million of payments, it has said. Sidhu remains nonexecutive chairman through year end. Sidhu left after criticism over his leadership and Sovereign's stagnant share price, including by the Philadelphia-based thrift's largest shareholder, Relational Investors LLC. Critics also faulted a June transaction in which Sovereign sold a nearly 20 percent stake for $2.4 billion to Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano ( SAN.MC ), and paid $3.6 billion for Brooklyn, New York-based Independence Community Bank Corp. Joseph Campanelli, who had led the bank's New England unit, is now interim chief executive. Sovereign disclosed the expected charge in its quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Last quarter, Sovereign posted an after-tax profit of $184 million, or 37 cents per share. Operating profit totaled 41 cents per share.

InBev, whose key brands include Stella Artois, Beck\\'s and Brahma, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were 1.209 billion euros ($1.54 billion), compared with 966 million euros a year earlier. InBev said the like-for-like increase was 19.0 percent, while sales gained 10.9 percent, or 7.1 percent on a like-for-like basis, to 3.542 billion euros. InBev\\'s profit was above the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 12 analysts for EBITDA of 1.144 billion euros. The average sales forecast was 3.54 billion euros. Volume growth of some 7.0 percent in Latin America and 14.2 percent in central and eastern Europe, with strong spikes in Russia and Ukraine, helped push up overall turnover. Consolidation of acquired units, Quinsa in Latin America and Fujian Sedrin in China, also helped. The company\\'s savings program in western Europe swelled the bottom line by trimming costs by 26 million euros in the third quarter. The program is partly to offset sluggish regional volumes. They fell 2.3 percent in the third quarter. Volumes also dropped 2.5 percent in North America, another mature market. MARGIN IMPROVEMENT Margins improved in all zones, as did revenues per hectoliter, with the exception of those in the Asia Pacific. InBev has so far not given a 2006 forecast, saying only it is aiming for an EBITDA margin of 30 percent in 2007, a target set when Interbrew and AmBev merged to form InBev in 2004. The margin after nine months of this year was already 31.8 percent. Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said that, with one quarter left, InBev was confident of achieving the 30 percent target ahead of plan. \"It\\'s a good result. At the margin level it is a very impressive improvement,\" said KBC Securities analyst Wim Hoste, referring to growth of 34.1 percent in the third quarter from 30.2 percent a year earlier. \"What is important is margin evolution and you know they have so much more to come,\" he added. KBC raised its share price target to 49 euros from 45. InBev plans to roll out its zero-based budgeting savings plans to eastern Europe and Asia. InBev also said its AmBev AMB4V.SAABV.N unit intended to make a voluntary offer to buy the shares it does not already own in Latin American brewer Quilmes Industrial SA LQU.N. It already has an economic interest of 91 percent. InBev shares have risen some 26 percent so far this year, outperforming the DJ Stoxx European food and beverage index, which is up 13 percent. SABMiller ( SAB.L ), the world\\'s second-largest brewer and maker of Miller Lite, Castle and Peroni, also released figures on Thursday. Its half-year earnings grew 7 percent, in line with expectations. InBev trades at over 17 times forecast 2007 earnings, a slight premium to rivals such as Heineken ( HEIN.AS ) and SABMiller due in part to its exposure to fast-growing markets, notably Latin America.',\n",

The brewer confirmed its underlying beer volumes rose 9 percent in the half-year as it posted strong growth in Europe and Asia/Africa but suffered a slowdown in its biggest market, South Africa, and continued volume declines at Miller. The brewer, which bought Colombia\\'s Bavaria for $7.8 billion in October 2005, said its South American beer volume growth exceeded its expectations, while it saw \"excellent\" beer volume growth in China and India. However, Miller reported a 12-percent plus fall in earnings after suffering price cuts from competitors, market share gains by imported and craft beers and a significant rise in commodity costs such as higher aluminum can prices. Miller accounts for around 14 percent of group profits. The London-based group also reported half-year earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) rose 41 percent to $1.781 billion, and proposed a half-year dividend up 8 percent at 14 U.S. cents a share. SABMiller makes over a third of its earnings in rand from beer and soft drinks, and the South African currency has depreciated sharply against the dollar so far this year to put pressure on its reported earnings in dollars. SABMiller shares have underperformed both the blue chip FTSE 100 Index  .FTSE  and the DJ Stoxx European food and beverage index .SX3P by around 11 percent so far this year.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - HealthSouth Corp. ( HLS.N ), still struggling with the fallout from an accounting scandal, posted a bigger quarterly loss on Thursday after one-time expenses, while revenue fell due to more stringent Medicare payments to its rehabilitation hospitals. \\n\\n Shares dropped 8 percent in morning trading. \"The overall operating trends continue to deteriorate,\" said Frank Morgan, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. \"Almost all business segments are negative.\" Recent new rules under Medicare, the federal health insurance program for 43 million elderly and disabled, have restricted the types of patients that quality for reimbursement at its rehabilitation facilities, and depressed HealthSouth revenues. Admissions to the biggest U.S. owner of rehabilitation facilities also dropped on fewer referrals from general hospitals. The rising numbers of uninsured patients and weaker employer-sponsored benefits have pushed down patient volume to general hospitals. The third-quarter net loss rose to $82.6 million, or $1.04 per share, from $11.5 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, adjusting for a one-for-five reverse stock split, HealthSouth lost about 4 cents per share, according to Morgan, who rated the stock as \"hold.\" Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates, on average, looked for a loss of 3 cents per share. HealthSouth, still emerging from a $2.7 billion accounting fraud that led to a restatement of several years of results, also faces pressure from tighter requirements under Medicare, the federal health insurance for 43 million elderly and disabled. Total revenue fell 4.6 percent to $731.2 million. Revenue in its biggest division -- inpatient rehabilitation -- dropped 4.6 percent. The Birmingham, Alabama-based company is selling its outpatient, surgery and diagnostics units to help pay down about $3.2 billion in debt that was amassed as it restated. The accounting scandal led to investigations by U.S. regulators and the ouster of founder and chief executive Richard Scrushy. It has settled charges over its financial reporting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department, and has agreed to pay $445 million to settle investor class-action lawsuits. The latest results included expenses of $28.4 million related to government, class action and other lawsuits. In March, HealthSouth entered into a credit deal to swap 50 percent of its long-term debt to fixed rates, which resulted in a net loss of $28.7 million in the third quarter. The company was relisted on the New York Stock Exchange in mid-October. Its CEO has said he expected the company to be profitable in the first half of 2007, once it divests three of its units. The company was delisted in March 2003 by the NYSE as the accounting fraud unfolded. Fifteen HealthSouth executives eventually pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a scheme to inflate earnings, though Scrushy was acquitted on charges he engineered the fraud. The stock fell $1.75 to $20.25 on the NYSE. Shares are down about 8 percent this year.',\n",

Last week, Microsoft and Novell NOVL.O entered a broad set of business and technological agreements to make their products work together to serve corporate customers using both Linux and Windows computer servers. On Tuesday, Novell said Microsoft would make up-front payments to it of $348 million under the deal. Ballmer, on a visit to India, said while he believed software would be increasingly downloaded and managed off the Internet, it would still also be sold through a more traditional chain. \"I think some software will be bought, some will be subscribed to and some will be monetized through advertising,\" Ballmer said in the interview in New Delhi. \"I would say we are moving to a world where there is a lot more electronic distribution. It is a new style of software, not the old-style distributed electronically.\" On Wednesday, Microsoft said Windows Vista, the software giant\\'s first major upgrade of its operating system in five years, would be available to retail customers on January 30. 2007. Plagued by a series of delays, Windows Vista is key to a new product cycle at the world\\'s largest software maker that includes a new version of its Office business software suite. Ballmer said people would be impressed by the new software, and also by Microsoft\\'s new portable media player, Zune. \"Lot of people will be impressed with what we offer in Zune. Lot of people are already impressed with what they have seen in XBox 360,\" he said of the gaming console. Zune, which hits store shelves next week, would compete against Apple Computer Inc.\\'s ( AAPL.O ) popular iPod music and video player, and Ballmer was confident of its success. \"The notion that iPod is an island is what plays into one of the strengths of Zune in what we can do,\" Ballmer said, also downplaying the threat posed by Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ). \"People point to Google because Google is the emblem for somebody who has embraced a different business model than we have,\" he said. \"The next frontier for us is to embrace a new business model.

Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa said the selling price was lower then he expected, but added that he was glad to see the company dump a non-core asset. Graceway Pharmaceuticals Inc. will buy 3M\\'s pharmaceutical operations in the United States, Canada and Latin America for $875 million. Graceway is a portfolio company of Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR Golder Rauner. Swedish drugs group Meda AB ( MEDAa.ST ) will buy 3M\\'s pharmaceutical business in Europe for $857 million. Meda shares surged in Stockholm by 10 percent after the news. Australian private equity firms Ironbridge Capital and Archer Capital will acquire 3M\\'s pharmaceutical operations in the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa, for $349 million. In a research note, Tusa said the deals represented multiples of about nine times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and less than three times sales. That compares with average multiples of 10.5 and 3.7, respectively, in the pharmaceutical sector, he said. But the analyst, who has an \"overweight\" rating on 3M shares, added, \"From a strategic perspective, however, the completion of the deals will be a meaningful step toward refocusing the portfolio around core technology strengths. Pharma did not fit well with the profile of the rest of the portfolio.\" 3M, known best as the maker of Scotch tape, Post-It notes, Thinsulate insulation and a host of other products, said the deals were expected to close in the fourth quarter. It said it would record a gain and charges as a result of the transactions. Of the 1,050 employees in the division, about 70 percent will be offered jobs with the acquiring companies, 3M said. 3M shares were off 46 cents at $79.06 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange and are up about 18 percent since hitting a 52-week low of $67.06 on July 25. BETTER OFF WITH SOMEONE ELSE On April 4, 3M said it was exploring the sale of the drug business, which develops and sells branded drug products related to dermatology, women\\'s health, cardiology and respiratory medicine. To be competitive, 3M said, its drugs business needs a broad pipeline of new products and significant investment, and would fit better with a dedicated pharmaceutical company.

Its branded pharmaceuticals include Difflam, Duromine, Tambocor, Maxair, Metrogel-Vaginal and Minitran. 3M, which was advised by Goldman Sachs in the deals, does not disclose the division\\'s annual sales, but Morningstar has estimated them at $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Last December, St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M tapped George Buckley as chief executive, replacing James McNerney, who departed for Boeing Co. ( BA.N ). Analysts said at the time that they expected Buckley to prune some businesses. The drug business is part of 3M\\'s health-care unit, which posted almost $4.4 billion in sales last year and is one of the company\\'s six major units.

       "  ' MUNICH  (Reuters) - Germany\\'s Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) struck a confident note on the current fiscal year and said on Thursday it would raise its dividend after fourth-quarter operating earnings beat forecasts, boosting its shares. \\n\\n The industrial conglomerate said a reshaping of the group was almost complete and reiterated that all its businesses would meet profitability targets in 2007, while sales would grow twice as fast as the world economy. Shares in Siemens rose on the news, despite uneven results at the group\\'s 11 units whose products range from hearing aids to trains. By 0940 GMT, they were up 3.8 percent to 74.51 euros, the top gainer in a flat German blue-chip index  .GDAXI . \"2006 was a year of restructuring. In 2007, we will see execution and increased emphasis on profitable growth,\" Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser told reporters. Siemens\\'s fourth-quarter operating profit rose by a forecast-beating 35 percent. It was lifted by strong results at healthcare unit Med, where Siemens has spent more than $7 billion on acquisitions in the last year, and factory-automation unit A&D. The results were also flattered by the fact that Siemens failed to book high restructuring charges that had been expected at its struggling IT services unit SBS, which narrowed its loss. Executives declined to say whether the charges would be booked in the current quarter but said the bulk of restructuring provisions had now been made as the group settles into its new shape, minus most of the telecoms business on which it was founded. They gave no update on the planned sale of corporate telecoms division Enterprise Networks, ahead of a news conference. Sources close to the talk have told Reuters in the past days that some of the last potential bidders have abandoned the sales process. Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ), one would-be buyer which the sources said has walked away from Siemens, reported better-than expected profits on Wednesday boosted by Internet traffic growth, sending its shares up 7.5 percent. SCEPTICISM ON TARGETS Since taking the helm at Siemens in January 2005, Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld has set about reshaping the 159-year-old company, eschewing short-term targets but promising to deliver on profitability goals next year after the revamp. Some analysts still doubt that Siemens will be able to hit operating profit margin targets ranging from 4 to 13 percent at all its units by next April, as promised. In the July-September quarter, five of 11 units met their goals. \"We are still skeptical whether all the remaining divisions will reach their targets in April 2007, although Siemens management sounds very confident,\" Merck Finck analyst Theo Kitz wrote in a note. Others said Siemens was backing up its words with deeds. \"They\\'re raising the dividend, which is a sign they\\'re very confident about 2007,\" said one London-based analyst who asked not be named. \"But it\\'s a very mixed bag of results again.\" Siemens said it would raise its dividend to 1.45 euros from 1.35 euros. It posted quarterly operating profit of 1.251 billion euros ($1.60 billion) compared with an average of 1.202 billion euros forecast in a Reuters poll of 21 analysts. New orders fell 4 percent to 22.616 billion euros in the quarter despite a resurgent economy in Europe, where Siemens makes about half its sales. That was below average market expectations of new orders at 24.204 billion euros. Sales rose 8 percent to 23.92 billion euros in the quarter, beating expectations for an average 22.93 billion euros, while income from continuing operations rose 29 percent to 640 million euros, less than expected. Telecoms unit Com swung to a loss despite higher sales, and took 195 million euros in severance charges. SBS narrowed its loss to 27 million euros on sales that fell 15 percent. Siemens shares trade at just under 14 times expected 2006/07 earnings, according to Reuters data. Rival conglomerates Dutch group Philips ( PHG.AS ) and General Electric ( GE.N ) of the United States trade at higher forward multiples of 19 and 15 respectively, reflecting uncertainty about Siemens\\'s ability successfully to transform its portfolio and become more profitable.

London Brent LCOc1 rose $1.73 to $61.32 a barrel. OPEC is lowering output and some members have said the group may cut supply further in December. The cutback comes as oil demand is nearing its seasonal peak in the Northern Hemisphere winter. \"There is rising product demand, rising crude demand and OPEC is cutting output,\" said Mike Wittner, analyst at investment bank Calyon. \"Global demand will get us back to mid-$60s crude by December.\" Gulf members of OPEC said on Wednesday they were fully committed to the 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) cut agreed from November, but said markets remained oversupplied for now. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf OPEC members have said they see scope for further supply cuts when the producer group next meets on December 14 in Nigeria. \"Definitely, OPEC will do what it takes to defend $60,\" said Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that OPEC\\'s existing plan to cut oil production could drain U.S. crude inventories more than normal. U.S. distillate stocks, including heating oil, fell last week by 2.7 million barrels, more than the 500,000-barrel draw expected, the U.S. government said on Wednesday. But this level still left stocks about 11 percent up on a year ago -- ahead of peak winter demand for fuel <EIA/S>. \"We\\'re seeing continuing reaction to the inventory reports,\" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Alaron Trading. Oil\\'s gains came as other commodities rose, with gold and silver hitting two-month highs. Platinum prices jumped more than 3 percent after the dollar fell on news that China\\'s central bank is planning to diversify its reserves. Further strength came from a rally in U.S. natural gas after data showed domestic supplies fell last week. Democrats, who swept Republicans from power in the U.S. House of Representatives, have pledged to roll back billions of dollars in tax breaks and financial incentives extended to the oil industry in energy legislation Congress passed last year.

Expectations for the company have risen in the year since Chief Executive Robert Iger took over and began an aggressive series of moves including buying Pixar Animation Studios, cutting production and staff at the film division, and offering TV shows and movies for sale on the Internet. In the fiscal fourth quarter, studio entertainment posted the biggest rise in revenue of all Disney units, growing 33 percent to $2.0 billion, and turned an operating profit of $214 million, compared with a $313 million loss a year earlier. In July, Disney cut about 20 percent of its studio workforce and said it would trim movie output by about half. Disney reported a fourth-quarter net profit of $782 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with $379 million, or 19 cents per share, a year before. Revenue rose 14 percent to $8.8 billion from $7.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected net earnings of 33 cents per share and revenue of $8.7 billion for the fourth quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Media networks revenue, boosted by higher advertising rates at sports network ESPN and for ABC primetime hits such as \"Desperate Housewives\" and \"Grey\\'s Anatomy,\" were up 10 percent and operating profit rose by 18 percent.

The results prompted Liberty Global, which is part of cable mogul John Malone\\'s vast media empire, to say it was on track to exceed full-year guidance targets of $6.2 billion of revenue, $2.2 billion of operating cashflow and 1.4 million new customers of individual services, or revenue generating units (RGUs). \"In particular, we should meaningfully exceed our guidance for RGU additions given the trends we are seeing so far in the fourth quarter, as we added over 150,000 RGUs in the month of October alone,\" Chief Executive Mike Fries said. Operating cashflow, a key figure watched by investors in the sector, was $599 million for the quarter and revenue rose to $1.62 billion from $1.1 billion. Liberty Global also posted a quarterly net profit -- a less significant measure in the industry -- of $445 million, or $1.03 a share, reversing a year-ago loss of $127.9 million, or 27 cents a share, after selling its French unit. The company\\'s loss from continuing operations widened. Among its 357,000 new RGUs in the quarter, gains were highest for high-speed Internet services, followed by telephony. Liberty Global ended the quarter with 18.25 million RGUs. Average monthly revenue per customer, known as ARPU, increased 7.7 percent from a year ago to 20.29 euros. It continues to seek acquisitions in central and eastern Europe after a busy year of deals including sales of operations in Sweden and France and additions in Switzerland, Australia and the Czech Republic. Fries continued to stump for his company\\'s share price, which he regularly claims is undervalued compared with its peers and given the company\\'s relative growth prospects. The shares, which trade on the U.S.-based Nasdaq, have gained 21 percent on the year, after closing on Wednesday at  $26.85.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) has agreed to pay Universal Music Group a fee for each new Zune digital music player it sells when the iPod rival launches next week, the companies said on Thursday. \\n\\n The groundbreaking deal could redefine the digital music business pioneered by Apple Computer Inc. ( AAPL.O ) Rivals including cell phone makers eventually could pay for hardware sales as well as for the music itself, Universal said. Microsoft is trying to break into an industry closely aligned with archival Apple, which is credited with nearly single-handedly building the legal Web music world with its iPod players and iTunes music store. But Apple does not give a cut of sales of iPods to music companies. It only pays labels for songs sold on its iTunes music store. \"We felt that any business that\\'s built on the bedrock of music we should share in,\" said Doug Morris, chief executive of Universal, owned by French media giant Vivendi ( VIV.PA ). He did not disclose the amount of the fee for the Zune, which launches next Tuesday. The iPod has a nearly 80 percent share of digital media player sales, and its iTunes music downloads site is also the dominant online music store. That has given Apple founder Steve Jobs a strong hand in negotiations with the music industry to date. \"We were very early in working with Steve on the launch of the iPod and he\\'s been a very good partner and done a lot for the industry,\" Morris said in an interview with Reuters. Like other record companies, Universal has a revenue-share deal with iTunes but no share of iPod sales. \"We have a current contract with him and at the end of that I\\'m sure we\\'ll negotiate,\" said Morris, whose company accounts for nearly one in three CDs sold in the United States. Morris said the deal could set a precedent in negotiations with other device manufacturers, including mobile phone makers, who are increasingly seeing music as important to the future of their businesses. Microsoft, which has already had early talks with other labels about the fee, said it is keen to work closely with artists in the development of Zune. Apple has benefited from working with artists including Universal act U2 -- with whom it developed a special version of the iPod. Chris Stephenson, general manager for global marketing at Microsoft Entertainment, said the fee was not a new idea. \"It\\'s not a new conversation, it\\'s been out there in the industry for a while,\" he said. \"We\\'ve been careful in thinking about it from an economic point of view from day one.\" There have been calls for a so-called iPod tax in some countries including Canada, Netherlands and the UK to help music companies who have lost sales to digital piracy, mainly through peer-to-peer file sharing over the Internet. Microsoft\\'s 30-gigabyte Zune will launch at a retail price of $249.99 with songs available for download at the Zune Marketplace service at 99 cents each. The Redmond, Washington-based software giant has said it will invest hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and market the Zune, and that it may take a while to be profitable.',\n",

The possible timeline on MySpace\\'s China ambitions comes on the heels of an announcement on Tuesday that News Corp has struck a joint venture deal with Softbank Corp. ( 9984.T ) to launch a version of MySpace in Japan. Chernin also said the company was seeking to buy Internet applications that could work with MySpace, although it was not on a \"big hunt.\" News Corp, which bought MySpace, one of the fastest-growing Internet properties, for about $580 million last year, has watched its stock soar 26 percent since it announced the deal. Shares were little changed after the latest results. It reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of $843 million, or 27 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $433 million, or 13 cents a share a year earlier, when it booked a $1 billion non-cash charge to reduce the value of its television stations federal licenses. Profit was boosted by advertising sales at the Fox TV network and Fox News network, as well as by a $261 million gain from the sale of its interest in Sky Brasil and the China-focused Phoenix Satellite Television Ltd. ( 8002.HK ). Revenue rose 4 percent to $5.9 billion. Wall Street expected the company to post a profit of 21 cents per share and revenue of $5.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. TV OFFSETS WEAK FILMS UNIT The television division\\'s operating income rose 20 percent to $192 million. Its cable network operating profit rose 26 percent to $249 million, mainly on an advertising sales gain from news and regional sports networks. \"The results were overall very positive. It\\'s a strong way to begin the year,\" UBS analyst Aryeh Bourkoff said, highlighting the cable networks performance. Operating income fell 6 percent to $851 million, from $909 million a year earlier, dragged by its movies division. That unit saw operating income fall 35 percent to $239 million as the year-earlier quarter included syndication fees for Fox TV shows and DVD sales from \"Robots\" and \"Hide and Seek\". Most big U.S. media stocks have rallied this year on investors\\' belief that the Internet will be a profit growth opportunity for years to come, with News Corp. outperforming the pack. Its enterprise value currently trades at 13-times its fiscal 2007 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared to Walt Disney Co.\\'s ( DIS.N ) 10 times and Time Warner Inc.\\'s ( TWX.N ) 9 times. News Corp. reaffirmed its fiscal 2007 outlook for operating income growth of 14 percent to 16 percent, excluding a $140 million gain from a U.K. property sale. Company executives also said it had no plans for an initial public offering for its Sky Italia satellite TV service.

VIAb.N said on Thursday it planned to create new digital networks for adults, as it reported a lower quarterly profit from continuing operations, dragged down by disappointing box-office results. \\n\\n As part of a management overhaul that saw the ouster of former Chief Executive Tom Freston in September, Chief Financial Officer Michael Dolan is leaving at the end of the year and will be succeeded by Chief Administrative Officer Thomas Dooley. Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone, who has taken a more active role in the businesses he built, appointed Dooley and another close associate, CEO Philippe Dauman, in September to craft an aggressive Internet strategy. Dauman said annual digital sales from the Internet, video games and mobile programming could reach $500 million as early as next year, after rising 73 percent in the third quarter. He repeated that the company would not make big Web acquisitions, preferring to build new properties internally and talk to early-stage companies. \"I will not clear an acquisition unless it has a strong return on capital,\" Dauman told analysts on a conference call. Viacom is expected to announce a slate of new \"multiplatform\" digital networks geared for adults, Dauman told analysts, but declined to say more. The targeting of older demographics, even as it continues to court youth viewers, comes after Viacom lost a bid for teenage social networking site MySpace.com to Rupert Murdoch\\'s News Corp. NWSa.N last year. The hugely popular teen hangout has shaped News Corp.\\'s online strategy and boosted its market value by a quarter. News Corp. on Wednesday forecast more than $500 million in Internet division revenue for fiscal 2007. In sharp contrast, Viacom\\'s Class B shares have fallen 5 percent this year, after splitting off its broadcast divisions and as its Internet strategy failed to excite investors. The stock was down 67 cents, or 1.7 percent, at $39.0 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. MTV UNDERPINS PROFIT Viacom, owner of the Paramount film studios and various cable networks, said third-quarter earnings from continuing operations fell to $356.3 million, or 50 cents per share, from $449.8 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time compensation charges and discrete tax benefits, earnings per share was 51 cents, beating the average analyst forecast of 47 cents according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 7 percent to $2.66 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $2.64 billion. \"The quarter illustrates the underlying strengths of the cable network business, with subscription fees up double digits and advertising up high single digits,\" Pali Capital analyst Richard Greenfield said. Cable network revenue rose 10 percent to $1.8 billion, as operating profit increased 14 percent to $778 million on higher advertising sales at the MTV group. The film division reported an operating loss of $6 million, compared with a year-earlier profit of $108.2 million, as revenue rose 1 percent to $856.5 million. Box office sales for such third-quarter releases as \"World Trade Center\" failed to surpass those for year-earlier titles, which included \"War of the Worlds.\" Corporate expenses also rose after a $62 million severance payout for Freston. \"I am confident that you will see further operational success in the not too distant future,\" Redstone said in a statement. Viacom affirmed its full year 2006 financial outlook, which calls for a double-digit percentage rise in revenue and operating income. The company also expects to post full-year earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.00 from continuing operations, excluding items.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Japan\\'s antitrust watchdog has told Qualcomm Inc.\\'s ( QCOM.O ) Japanese subsidiary that it may investigate its licensing and chip business practices in Japan, Qualcomm said on Thursday, sending its shares down more than 3 percent. \\n\\n Japan\\'s Fair Trade Commission did not say when it might investigate the company or identify any complainant, Qualcomm said. Qualcomm President Steve Altman said the company would cooperate with the commission. The company\\'s shares fell $1.27, or 3.5 percent to $32.01 on Nasdaq on Thursday afternoon. The news comes after sources said last week that the European Commission is likely to intensify its investigation of Qualcomm\\'s patent licensing rates for a new generation of mobile phone technology. Qualcomm sells technology licenses and chips based on CDMA, the dominant technology standard for U.S. cell phones, as well as those for GSM, the world\\'s most widely used cell phone technology. Its patents are also used in W-CDMA, known as the high-speed, third-generation (3G), standard that is more advanced than GSM. Some of the world\\'s biggest wireless technology firms had complained to European regulators that Qualcomm was charging too much to license patents for the 3G equipment. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. ( 6752.T ), Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ), NEC Corp. ( 6701.T ), Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N and Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) have said Qualcomm\\'s fees were far higher than the agreed-upon standard of \"fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory.\" In the United States, Qualcomm has been locked in a bitter legal fight with rival Broadcom over chip patents. The two companies have accused each other of patent infringements.',\n",
       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Sporting goods maker Adidas cut its 2007 profit outlook as it pours extra cash into its U.S. acquisition Reebok, triggering a sharp fall in its shares that wiped off a tenth of its market value on Thursday. \\n\\n A 16 percent fall in orders at Reebok overshadowed an otherwise solid third quarter at Adidas, the world\\'s second-largest sports goods firm after U.S. rival Nike. Brokers rushed to cut their recommendations on the stock, which is now this year\\'s worst performer on Germany\\'s DAX of top 30 shares. \"More work is needed at Reebok,\" Chief Executive Herbert Hainer told reporters in a conference call. Adidas said net income growth would approach 15 percent in 2007 instead of a previously forecast 20 percent, blaming lower profit expectations at Reebok and investment in new products and advertising to beef up flagging sales. Adidas bought Reebok for $3.8 billion last year to take on Nike in its home turf, but it has yet to convince investors that the acquisition will pay off. Adidas said Reebok orders were unlikely to start rising before the second half of 2007, even though the U.S. firm would post profits this and next year. \"The order decline is disappointing. We\\'ll probably have to wait until the second half of 2007 to see noticeable improvements at Reebok,\" said fund manger Joerg Dehning at Pioneer Investments, Adidas\\' second-biggest investor according to Reuters data. Merck Finck analyst Nils Lesser, who cut the stock to hold from buy, was skeptical: \"It will take longer to put Reebok on track.\" SHARES PLUNGE Adidas shares fell 11 percent in early trade and were down 8.4 percent at 37.56 euros at 1229 GMT, wiping out gains made in October on upbeat result expectations. The trading volume was 9 times above the 90-day average. Dehning said he would not use the fall to buy into the stock. \"We\\'ll keep Adidas shares for the time being. I don\\'t see any reason to stock up despite the fall,\" he said. The Reebok news soured euphoria triggered by the soccer World Cup in Germany that helped Adidas\\'s sales surge in the second quarter, and lifted the stock to above 43 euros in May. Adidas bought Reebok to complement its strength in classical sports wear such as soccer boots and its strong position in Europe with Reebok\\'s focus on the U.S. market and lifestyle fashion, a segment tapped successfully by rival Puma But investors have been skeptical from the start about the Reebok deal, questioning Adidas\\'s ability to ensure a smooth integration of a company on the other side of the Atlantic. Adidas has launched a revamp for Reebok\\'s product line and sales strategy and said it stuck to its goal of achieving annual savings of 175 million euros from the takeover from 2009. But HVB analysts said no improvement at Reebok was in sight, cutting Adidas shares to \"neutral\" from \"outperform\" and lowering their price target to 39 euros from 45.50 euros. The problems at Reebok overshadowed a solid third quarter, with Adidas\\' net income rising 13 percent to 244 million euros, above the average forecast of 231 million in a Reuters poll. Quarterly sales rose by 53 percent to 2.949 billion euros, driven by growth in Europe, North America and Asia, above the average analyst forecast of 2.877 billion.

The company, which is moving to transform its image from a stodgy retailer into a trendy one with fashionable merchandise, reported net income of $287 million, or $1.26 per share, up from $234 million, or 94 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, had been expecting it to earn $1.23 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. J.C. Penney and rival Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) are working to grab a larger share of business from middle-income Americans by introducing more stylish and exclusive merchandise, and by opening stores closer to their shoppers. The efforts are paying off, with sales at both retailers rising, and the National Retail Federation predicting that more college-age shoppers will be heading to department stores for their holiday gift buying this year. For the fourth-quarter, Penney forecast earnings per share of approximately $1.94, compared with analysts' current view of  $1.91. Penney said total net sales rose 6.7 percent to $4.78 billion, in line with analysts' estimates. Sales at department stores open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer's health known as comparable store sales, increased 5.2 percent. Penney said its gross margin improved by 80 basis points to 42.6 percent of sales, helped by its private brands and better inventory management. Penney has been working hard to improve the range and quality of its private and exclusive merchandise, which now account for more than 50 percent of its revenue and typically offers better margins than name-brand items. It has introduced new brands like East 5th for women and X-Games clothes for boys. It is also opening new stores, many in locations outside of malls, which it says gives it better access to the convenience shopper who wants to stop by the store on the way home from work instead of driving to a mall. In the third quarter, Penney said it opened 25 new stores, with 22 in the off-mall format. As of October 28, it operated 1,037 department stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Penney's shares have risen almost 41 percent this year, compared with a 51 rise for Kohl's and an 8.4 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's Retailing Index .GSPMS.\",\n",

Kohl's said its quarterly sales rose 16.6 percent to $3.6 billion, which was above analysts expectations of $3.55 billion. Its comparable store sales -- a key retail gauge that measures sales at stores open at least one year -- increased 8.5 percent. Kohl's has added more contemporary and exclusive clothing brands like Chaps and Candie's to increase its sales and attract a wider range of shoppers to its stores.

       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - When Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) launches the PlayStation 3 in Japan this weekend, they will likely fly off store shelves in no time. But the road to profitability is expected to be a long and rocky one for Sony\\'s game business. \\n\\n Sony will roll out the latest version of its blockbuster games machine in Japan on Saturday in a three-way showdown with Microsoft Corp.\\'s ( MSFT.O ) Xbox 360 and Nintendo Co.\\'s 7974.OS upcoming Wii in the nearly $30 billion video-game market. The stakes are high for Sony. With its Walkman music players trailing far behind Apple Computer Inc.\\'s ( AAPL.O ) iPod in a market the Tokyo-based company created more than a quarter of a century ago, losing its leading position in another key market would be nothing less than a nightmare. Sony, which has dominated the game market over the past decade, packs the PS3 with its cutting-edge technology including a Blu-ray high-definition DVD player and the Cell microchip, dubbed a \"supercomputer on a chip\". The advanced functions and components guarantee lifelike graphics to please hard-core gamers. But they come at a price. Sony, which calls the PS3 its most important strategic product of the year, plans to sell a basic model for 49,980 yen ($424), almost double the price of the Wii and 26 percent higher than the Xbox 360. Still, Sony is expected to rack up a loss for every PS3 it sells, and the electronics maker forecast an operating loss of 200 billion yen at its game unit for the year to March. \"The game business has been such a huge cash-cow operation for Sony,\" Shinko Securities analyst Hideki Watanabe said. \"As the market moves onto new-generation machines, focus is on whether or not the next big wave is coming for Sony, and if the wave is as big as the one it rode at the time of the PS2. I, for one, am quite pessimistic.\" Sony has shipped more than 100 million units of PlayStation and more than 110 million units of the PS2. In the third and fourth year of the PS2 launch, the two years to March 2003, its game unit earned about 60 percent of Sony\\'s group operating profit. Game makers often post losses at the initial stage of a console launch by setting prices low to spur sales. But this time around, Sony is likely to have a difficult time turning its PS3 business profitable even in the medium term due to its high prices and the strong performance of its rival machines, as well as competition from handheld games, the Internet and mobile phones for customers\\' limited time and money, analysts say. LONG-TERM PROJECT Expectations are high that Nintendo will repeat the success of its hot-selling DS handheld machine with the Wii, which is slated for launch on November 19. The company developed the Wii not to please hardcore gamers with true-to-life graphics but to entice game novices with innovative but easy-to-play games -- the same concept that helped the DS far outsell Sony\\'s PlayStation Portable (PSP). Nintendo last month raised its sales forecast for the DS to 20 million units from 17 million for the year to March, while Sony slashed its PSP shipment target for the same period by 25 percent to 9 million, boding ill for the PS3. \"I\\'m afraid the population Sony is targeting does not exactly match the population that is actually doing games,\" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. \"There always is a group of devoted game players out there, and they are eagerly awaiting the PS3. But that type of market is quite limited,\" Akino said. Microsoft, the other rival, became the first company to launch the latest-generation game console by offering the Xbox 360 late last year, beating Sony by a year in time to market. By the end of calendar 2006, the world\\'s largest software maker expects its Xbox 360 shipments to reach 10 million, running far ahead of the PS3\\'s expected shipment of 2 million units. Some analysts said, however, advanced technologies loaded in the PS3 will likely give the console a long life span, and the game gear should not be judged solely by its initial performance. \"Unlike what happened to the PS2, it will be difficult for the PS3 to achieve an annual shipment of 20 million units,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Masahiro Ono said. \"But if you think about its Blu-ray function, network capability and hard disk scalability, its product life span can be as long as 10 years. There is a chance that the PS3 will eventually surpass the total PS2 shipment of 110 million.\"',\n",

       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) hopes to capture up to 40 percent of the customers for its new Buick Enclave from rival brands as it pushes to reestablish Buick in the luxury car market, a spokesman said on Friday. \\n\\n \"We are very encouraged we will draw customers from competitors,\" Buick spokesman Dave Darovitz said. \"It could be as high as 40 percent, although it\\'s always hard to put a number on that.\" The 2008 Enclave, a five-door luxury crossover sport utility vehicle, will compete with Honda Motor Co. Ltd\\'s ( 7267.T ) Acura MDX, Toyota Motor Corp.\\'s ( 7203.T ) Lexus RX 350 and DaimlerChrysler AG\\'s DCXGn.DE Mercedes R Class 350. While Buick has not announced the pricing of the model yet, Darovitz said the new Enclave would be \"several thousand dollars cheaper\" than the 2007 Acura MDX, which has a base price of $39,995. The world\\'s largest automaker will use cutting-edge soundproofing technology to make the vehicle one of the quietest on the road, Darovitz said. Global Insight analyst George Magliano said he had \"very high\" expectations for the Enclave because of its fuel efficiency and smooth ride. \"GM is basically is moving into a segment all on its own,\" he said, referring to the large crossover SUV segment. Sales of car-based \"crossover\" utility vehicles -- which offer the high ride and roomy cabins of an SUV with the handling and fuel mileage of a passenger car -- are on track to reach 2.4 million units this year, according to analysts. The segment has been one of the few bright spots in a slowing U.S. auto market. Overall sales have dropped 3 percent so far this year and many analysts expect the slump to deepen in 2007. GM, which lost $10.6 billion last year, is trying to reverse a slide in market share in part by more sharply differentiating its eight brands to reduce the overlap of models. GM is working to group the GMC and Buick brands under one dealership, making Buick the luxury brand. Buick\\'s U.S. sales fell 15 percent in the first 10 months of 2006. \"The Enclave will bring Buick back,\" Darovitz said. GM will build the Enclave at a plant near Lansing, Michigan. The new vehicle goes on sale in mid-2007, but GM will unveil the production version this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Golf star Tiger Woods, who signed a five year promotional deal with GM, is expected to be central to the marketing effort for the Enclave, which GM hopes will take Buick to a younger and more affluent set of buyers. IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle said the Enclave showed the strength of GM\\'s pipeline of launches under the automaker\\'s product chief Bob Lutz. \"The Enclave is really the first true Lutz product for Buick,\" Merkle said. Merkle expected the three GM crossovers that share the same platform -- the Outlook, Acadia and Enclave -- could sell over 200,000 units in their first year on a combined basis. \"What\\'s important is that they finally have some crossovers that are going to be profitable,\" he said of GM. Merkle said a full revival for the Buick brand would depend on the launch of new sedans for the brand that are not expected to arrive until 2009. \"The Enclave is definitely a huge leap in the right direction,\" he said.

       "  \" CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Negotiators for the United Steelworkers and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. are set to meet next week for the first time since union members went on strike in North America five weeks ago, the union and company said on Friday. \\n\\n The full negotiating teams from the union and the company are scheduled to meet Tuesday morning at a neutral site in Cincinnati, the union and Goodyear said separately. Goodyear said in a statement it would be the first formal negotiations since the strike began. Union spokesman Wayne Ranick stopped short of calling it a resumption of talks. Shares of Goodyear have jumped 18.8 percent since Thursday morning, when it released better-than-expected quarterly earnings, and said it was willing to resume talks. About 15,000 United Steelworkers members went on strike October 5 at 12 Goodyear facilities in the U.S. and four in Canada after the union rejected Goodyear's latest contract offer, citing concerns about plant closings and other issues. Goodyear, the largest U.S. tire maker, on Thursday said it remained committed to reducing high-cost production in North America under a restructuring plan that includes cost cuts and a focus on more profitable Goodyear brand tires. In late October, Goodyear said it would close a Tyler, Texas, plant covered by the union contract where 1,100 workers produce mainly private label tires. Its most recent proposal would protect all contract plants except Tyler. Ranick said the union remains open to discussions, but opposes the closing of plants covered by the contract. Goodyear reported losing $30 million to $35 million a week in operating income early in the strike and said North American production has been less than 50 percent of pre-strike levels. The company's contingency plan has included increasing imports from its overseas operations, running nonunion plants in North America at full capacity and using salaried and temporary workers at its struck plants. Shares of Goodyear rose 48 cents, or 2.74 percent, to $18.02 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.\",\n",

With congressional elections out of the way, analysts say there is reason to be optimistic about the coming holiday shopping season. \"The fall in gas prices has psychologically been better for people and the unemployment rate is very low, so there are people out there who can spend,\" said Scott Vergin, portfolio manager at Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis. \"Plus, with Rumsfeld out, there\\'s hope things will change for the better with the war and that may help sentiment during the Christmas season,\" he added, referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld\\'s resignation on Wednesday, a day after the Democrats\\' big election victory. Rumsfeld said he quit because the political climate changed after the Democrats\\' win, which was driven by anger over the Iraq war. The Democratic sweep of Congress in Tuesday\\'s midterm elections prompted some investors to worry that it would bring about a wave of legislation unfriendly to various business sectors. Still, stocks achieved their best weekly performance in a month. \"A tone will come out of Washington of cooperation or friction. In some parts, friction and gridlock is favorable to the markets -- don\\'t make any new laws and let\\'s have a stable environment,\" said Robert Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts. On Friday, stocks ended the week higher.

The Nasdaq gave its best performance in two months, with a weekly gain of 2.53 percent. It ended Friday at 2,389.72. Fred Dickson, director of retail research at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon, said he believes the October readings on the U.S. Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index will be fairly benign. \"I don\\'t think we\\'ll get any big surprises in inflation,\" Dickson said. \"We\\'ll probably continue in a trading range environment, with the Dow holding in the 12,000 level, maybe even a little higher.\" PPI, FED MINUTES AND CPI Next week\\'s economic calendar heats up on Tuesday, with the Labor Department\\'s October report on the Producer Price Index. That will be followed on Wednesday with the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s most recent policy meeting on October 24-October 25, when it held its benchmark fed funds rate steady at 5.25 percent for the third consecutive time. And on Thursday, the Labor Department will release the October Consumer Price Index. Brett Gallagher, deputy chief investment officer with Julius Baer in New York, said, \"The rally since the summer has been built on the change in perception that the Fed may not have to continue raising rates, and in fact after a period of pause, (it) may be getting ready to lower rates. \"That drove the market and that can only happen if inflation remains in check, so I think the inflation numbers are the biggest factor,\" Gallagher said. Economists polled by Reuters expect the overall PPI to decline 0.5 percent in October, after a drop of 1.3 percent in September. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the forecast calls for core PPI to rise 0.1 percent in October, following a 0.6 percent gain in September. \"Due to the fact oil and gasoline prices have come down, we\\'ll probably see the headline numbers on both PPI and CPI come down,\" said Dickson of D.A. Davidson & Co. \"The core CPI number will be up in the 0.2 (percent) or 0.3 (percent) range, flat versus a month ago, and equity investors will look at that and see inflation on a moderating course and earnings will drive the market.\" Overall October CPI is forecast to drop 0.3 percent, following September\\'s 0.5 percent decline, according to the Reuters poll. Core CPI is pegged at an October gain of 0.2 percent, matching September\\'s rise of 0.2 percent.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve continues to monitor money supply gauges for clues on the economy even though the measures are no longer reliable as forecasting tools for economic growth or inflation, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday. \\n\\n \"Forecast errors for money growth are often significant, and the empirical relationship between money growth and variables such as inflation and nominal output growth has continued to be unstable at times,\" Bernanke said in prepared remarks to a European Central Bank conference in Frankfurt. Bernanke did not comment on the outlook for interest rates, inflation or economic growth in his prepared comments, which were made available in Washington. Despite concerns, money growth may still contain important information about future economic developments, Bernanke said. \"Attention to money growth is thus sensible as part of the eclectic modeling and forecasting network used by the U.S. central bank,\" he said. The money supply measures the liquidity of different types of money, including currency, bank deposits and money market mutual funds. The Fed publishes data on money supply and has in the past set targets for money supply growth. But it abandoned that practice when a statutory reporting requirement lapsed in 2000 because the relationship between money supply growth and the performance of the U.S. economy had become unreliable. The rapid pace of financial innovation in the United States is one reason for the instability of the links between measurements of money supply and aspects of the economy, Bernanke said. Overseas holdings of a substantial portion of the U.S. currency has also contributed to this instability, he said. Bernanke\\'s comments come on the heels of a warning by ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet against completely rejecting the use of monetary aggregates by central banks as a tool in setting policy. \"A model of monetary policy that includes no role for money is incomplete in some important respects,\" Trichet wrote in the Financial Times on Thursday.',\n",
       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - China will diversify its $1 trillion foreign exchange reserves, the largest in the world, across different currencies and investment instruments, including in emerging markets, Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Friday. \\n\\n His remarks sent the dollar tumbling for a second day and fueled a growing debate about how China should best use its fast-growing reserves, which are about 70 percent in U.S. debt securities, bankers estimate. \"(Diversification) includes currencies, investment instruments, including emerging markets,\" Zhou told Reuters on Friday on the sidelines of a monetary conference here. Asked about selling U.S. dollars, he said: \"We do not have any new preparations for selling any currencies.\" He said gold sales were not under consideration. Changes in China\\'s massive stockpile of money are being closely watched because it could ripple through financial markets worldwide, risking a steep dollar fall if U.S. debt floods onto the market, which could push up U.S. interest rates and slow global growth. These fears caused the U.S. dollar to hit a 2-1/2 month low against the euro <FRX/>, while gold prices rose to fresh two-month highs but emerging market debt was largely unaffected. In comments published on Friday, Chinese researchers said the country\\'s huge pile of reserves was a double-edged sword. On the one hand it increased foreign confidence in China\\'s economic stability and laid the foundation for China to make the yuan  CNY=CFXS  fully convertible in future. On the other hand the reserves symbolized China\\'s growing economic imbalances, including a record trade surplus, and so helped spark friction with its main trading partners. It also exposed China to more market risks, generated upward pressure on the yuan, raised the risk of inflation and made it harder for the central bank to conduct monetary policy, they said. \"China now faces a dilemma. It either keeps the exchange rate stable or sacrifices sound economic growth,\" Dou Erxiang, a researcher at Peking University, told the official newspaper Financial News. GROWTH SLOWDOWN Speaking on a panel with the world\\'s leading central bankers in Frankfurt, Zhou said that a mushrooming trade surplus meant China needed stronger policy adjustment both on the yuan and through boosting internal demand. But he said any changes to the yuan would be gradual to avoid unbalancing the domestic economy. He also said the Chinese economy was showing signs of slowing and declined to talk of further interest rate rises at this stage. China depegged the yuan from the dollar in July last year, allowing for a 2.1 percent revaluation. It has since appreciated more but many analysts say it is still greatly undervalued, given China\\'s trade surpluses and foreign capital inflows. \"The reason why we adopt a gradual approach for exchange rate reform is because China has a very large amount of labor working in the trade-related sector,\" Zhou said. \"So we have to consider this. We should avoid too much or too sudden closing-down or bankruptcies of enterprises and laying-off of workers. \"We are trying to manage to adjust the balance of payments and meanwhile to keep domestic economy in the good (state).\" China is growing at its fastest pace since 1995, driven by a boom in exports and investment that is feeding on cheap money, but Zhou expressed satisfaction that the pace of growth was easing from the first quarter\\'s 11.3 percent. \"It has already slowed down to some extent so we have reached the expected result of macro-economic adjustment,\" he said. In August China raised interest rates for the second time in four months to help tame a boom in credit and investment than some fear could end in a hard landing for the economy. Asked whether or not rates will rise further, Zhou said: \"It is not convenient to say right now.\" The central bank was also waiting to see the impact of the increase in bank reserve requirements, tightened by half a percentage point last week for the third time in five months. Zhou brushed off a jump in China\\'s trade surplus to $23.83 billion in October, a third more than economists had forecast. \"Recent trade surpluses to some extent are related to season because now it\\'s close to Christmas... We should observe average monthly trade surplus,\" Zhou said. (Additional reporting by  Natsuko Waki  and  Ilona Wissenbach )',\n",
       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - The economic outlook for the Group of Seven industrial nations has improved, an OECD report released on Friday showed, but it also pointed to slowing growth in the euro area. \\n\\n The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said its composite leading indicator for the G7 area rose to 105.6 in September from a revised 105.2 in August. Italy was the only one of the seven countries to post a decline. The figure for the 30-nation OECD area also improved, to 109.6 in September from a revised 109.1 the previous month. A less volatile measure, the six-month rate of change, rose by 2.5 percent in September for the OECD area compared with 2.1 percent in August. But that same indicator for the euro zone countries rose 2.7 percent, slower than the 3.1 percent rise in the previous month. \"The latest composite leading indicators suggest that slow economic expansion lies ahead in the OECD area,\" the OECD said. \"September 2006 data show improved performance in the CLI\\'s (composite leading indicator) six-month rate of change in the United States and Japan, but weakening performance in the Euro area.\" The 6-month indicator for the United States climbed 2.6 percent after rising 1.4 percent in August and for Japan, the fall was less steep in September -- a drop of 2.0 percent compared with a 2.4 percent fall the previous month. The OECD also said the data for non-member economies pointed to a weakening outlook for Russia and India, moderating growth in China and steady expansion in Brazil.

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Surging demand and lower OPEC production may start to deflate world fuel stockpiles that have been filling at the fastest rate in 15 years, the International Energy Agency said on Friday. \\n\\n The rebound in consumption will come after fuel use grew less quickly than expected in the first nine months of the year, prompting the Paris-based agency to cut its 2006 global demand growth forecast by 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 900,000 bpd. The outlook for world demand growth next year was steady at 1.45 million bpd to 85.9 million bpd, with China driving the expansion. \"Demand growth in the fourth quarter is expected to be exceptionally strong,\" said Lawrence Eagles, head of the IEA\\'s Oil Industry and Markets division. \"And that is not even allowing for a cold winter. If we see a cold winter it will be even stronger.\" Stocks have begun to decline, but it would take severe weather to make a dent in OECD inventories that rose by 1.15 million bpd in the third quarter, the biggest rise since 1991, the energy advisor to 26 industrialized nations said. It is high stockpiles that spurred the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries into its first output reduction in two years, effective from November 1. Even before the 1.2 million bpd cut, OPEC was pumping less. October output from the group that pumps more than a third of the world\\'s oil was 29.4 million bpd, down 335,000 bpd from September and 400,000 bpd below the requirement for its crude during the fourth quarter, the IEA said. At the same time, the world\\'s thirst for oil will rise 2.4 million bpd from the third quarter, the IEA said, 400,000 bpd higher than its forecast last month. \"We would expect to see stock falls in winter anyway, but the OPEC cut doesn\\'t help the situation,\" said Eagles. Lower OPEC output lifted the group\\'s spare capacity to 2.15 million bpd in October, up 210,000 bpd on the previous month. ECONOMIC HEALTH? Adding to OPEC\\'s concerns that the market is not in balance, there are signs the economy is under strain in top consumer the United States, where stockpiles are weighing particularly heavy. This year\\'s demand data is distorted because year-ago comparison are skewed by last year\\'s hurricane season, which had a major impact on oil and gas production in the U.S. Gulf. Until September, the U.S. was showing a weaker-than-expected demand recovery, but since then cheaper prices at the pump have encouraged consumption. On Friday, U.S. oil was trading at just above $60 a barrel, roughly 25 percent lower than its July peak of $78.40. Regardless of any slowdown in the U.S. economy and oil consumption, China, the world\\'s second biggest consumer, is expected to take up the slack. \"Even if the U.S. economy were to slow down, the world economy (and global demand) are likely to hold their ground,\" the IEA said. \"The structural support of Chinese consumption, economic growth, is still strong and likely to remain so, at least in the short term.\" Producers outside OPEC are expected to meet an increasing share of demand, but this year they have failed to deliver. The IEA cut its 2006 non-OPEC supply growth forecast by 90,000 bpd to 900,000 bpd. Next year, however, non-OPEC production is predicted to grow by 1.78 million bpd to 52.7 million bpd, helping to reduce OPEC\\'s burden by about half a million bpd to 28.3 million bpd, the IEA said.',\n",
       "  ' MANADO, Indonesia  (Reuters) - Prosecutors asked on Friday for a three-year jail sentence for the president director of an Indonesian unit of U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corp., on trial over pollution charges in a controversial case. \\n\\n Environmentalists see it as a test of whether Indonesia is serious about tackling pollution, while some business groups say the charges are unjustified and the action will scare off foreign investors. Chief prosecutor Purwanta told the Manado district court in North Sulawesi province that Newmont Minahasa Raya (NMR) had polluted the environment and its president director, American Richard Ness, did nothing to stop it. The prosecutor also demanded the company be fined 1 billion rupiah ($110,000 dollars) and Ness pay 500 million rupiah or serve an additional six months in prison. Ness told reporters after the hearing: \"The recommendation is absolutely a complete mockery of your court system.\" \"It seems like whoever wrote those charges never sat at this court... They just don\\'t understand the evidence,\" he said. Newmont\\'s lawyer Luhut Pangaribuan said in a statement issued by the company that the prosecution had failed to prove any of its allegations. Under Indonesian law, a prosecution sentencing demand serves as a strong recommendation for the court. But judges have the right to ignore the advice when considering their verdict. The maximum sentence for Ness allowed by law would be 10 years. Prosecutors accuse NMR of dumping toxic substances into a bay near its now defunct gold mine, making villagers sick. A team led by Indonesia\\'s Environment Ministry said in 2004 that arsenic and mercury content in tailings dumped by Newmont in Buyat Bay had contaminated sediment and entered the food chain. However, other tests failed to find abnormal levels of pollutants, and the company says its practices were safe and authorized by the government. Newmont opened the North Sulawesi gold mine in 1996 and closed the site after the last ore was processed in August 2004. The company also operates Asia\\'s second-largest copper mine, Batu Hijau, on eastern Sumbawa island, which produced 718 million pounds of copper and 719,000 ounces of gold last year.',\n",

This means Bank of America could acquire another $54 billion in deposits. Bove wrote that Bank of America would be precluded from buying the 11 top depositories in the United States but it could buy any of the 9,000 other banks in the country. \"If one assumes that the government might let Bank of America sell off enough deposits after a merger to get under the 10 percent deposit ceiling required by law, then there are really only 9 banks it could not acquire in a realistic sense,\" Bove wrote. Bank of America spokesman Terry Francisco said the company did not comment on speculation, but pointed out that chief executive Kenneth Lewis has said the company sees no strategic imperative to make an acquisition. KeyCorp spokesman Bill Murschel said the company does not comment on analyst speculation. As to where Bank of America is likely to acquire, Bove wrote that the U.S. Midwest would seem likely as it is the only region of the country the bank does not blanket with branches. \"Who might the bank buy? Not U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ), it is too big,\" Bove wrote. \"Everyone else in the market is possible and KeyCorp might even be probable.\" KeyCorp has a market value of about $14.75 billion.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of New York Stock Exchange owner NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N shot to a new high on Friday, given a boost by various factors such as speculation it could remove trading fee caps, according to one analyst. \\n\\n Shares of the company, which became publicly traded in March through its acquisition of electronic rival Archipelago Holdings Inc., ended up 7.9 percent at a closing high of $94.48 on the NYSE, after reaching an intra-day high of $96.75. The shares started trading in March at around $64. Other exchanges also got a lift, such as Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ), up 4.9 percent at $37.79, and International Securities Exchange Inc. ISE.N, the largest U.S. equity options market, up 4.8 percent to $49.31. Richard Herr, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, cited speculation that the NYSE was considering removing trading fee caps. Dealers trade for free after reaching a certain threshold in trading volume, said Herr, and removing the cap would open up opportunities for the NYSE to get paid on all the volume. An NYSE spokesman declined to comment. Herr also cited developments in NYSE\\'s bid to buy Paris-based exchange Euronext ENXT.PA. Euronext management in June accepted a takeover proposal by NYSE and rejected a rival offer by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ). The NYSE bid will soon be put to vote by Euronext shareholders. The Wall Street Journal said on Friday that Deutsche Boerse faces a potential new hurdle in its campaign to buy Euronext, with two European Union officials saying antitrust regulators doubted whether they should review Deutsche Boerse\\'s preliminary offer. That could help the NYSE\\'s offer, Herr said. In addition, the WSJ reported that business had won the battle to ease one of the most controversial requirements mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate-reform law -- which the paper said could be good news for U.S. stock exchanges. Separately, analysts and dealers said NYSE shares got a boost after Wall Street pundit Jim Cramer told CNBC that the stock could rise. Herr said the exchange sector as a whole was being boosted by the NYSE\\'s rise. \"If the NYSE is moving up, to some extent you can make the case that the space is being revalued today and valuations are moving higher.\" Meanwhile, shares of the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) have been actively traded in the past few sessions as investors position themselves for a possible fresh bid for the exchange, possibly coming on Monday, analysts and dealers told Reuters in London. Nasdaq had its offer for the LSE rebuffed earlier this year. It has since built up a stake of about 25 percent in the LSE. LaBranche & Co. Inc. LAB.N, the NYSE\\'s largest market maker, rose 10.6 percent to $9.67. Analyst Richard Repetto at Sandler O\\'Neill said its shares were up because it has a large shareholding in the NYSE. LaBranche owns about 3 million shares of NYSE, according to Reuters data.',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The American Heart Association on Friday said it would not allow Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) to present a study on its closely watched drug torcetrapib at the organization\\'s scientific meeting next week after the drugmaker broke an AHA embargo. \\n\\n The heart association had pulled an abstract with data from the study of the cholesterol drug from its meeting planning Web site in response to Pfizer issuing some of the data in an October 31 news release. But on Thursday had said the official presentation would go ahead as planned at next week\\'s meeting in Chicago. The association reversed that decision on Friday, issuing a statement saying that it has decided to pull the torcetrapib presentation from its scientific session. \"Prior to this decision the meeting planners had removed the abstract from the on-line meeting planner while internal discussions were underway,\" the AHA statement said. \"Today after discussions among AHA staff and leadership the AHA has decided to pull (Pfizer\\'s) presentation in accordance with AHA embargo policy.\" Pfizer did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Torcetrapib, a drug designed to raise levels of HDL, or \"good\" cholesterol, is by far the most important experimental medicine in Pfizer\\'s developmental pipeline. The world\\'s No. 1 drugmaker is looking to torcetrapib to counter revenue declines when Lipitor loses patent protection in 2011. Lipitor, which lowers levels of LDL, or \"bad\" cholesterol, is the world\\'s top-selling prescription medicine with annual sales of about $13 billion. The late-stage study that was to be presented compared torcetrapib plus Lipitor against Lipitor alone in patients with high cholesterol. In its October 31 news release, Pfizer said the combination raised HDL levels and lowered LDL levels significantly more than Lipitor alone. But existing concerns about torcetrapib were heightened by another signal that the drug also raised blood pressure, a risk factor for heart attack.',\n",
       "  ' DUESSELDORF, Germany  (Reuters) - Corus Chief Executive Philippe Varin on Friday defended the 4.3 billion pound ($8.20 billion) agreed takeover offer from Tata Steel that would create the world\\'s fifth-largest steelmaker. \\n\\n \"We think it is definitely a good offer,\" he said at an industry conference in Germany. \"It is the right partner at the right time.\" The Anglo-Dutch steelmaker last month approved the Tata offer, which Varin said remained on track. Official offer documents could be published later on Friday or on Saturday, he said, expressing confidence the deal could close by January. Standard Life Investments, Corus\\'s biggest shareholder with a 7.9 percent stake, said at the time that the offer of 455 pence per share did not represent \"significant value\". \"It has happened that shareholders say \\'It is not enough\\',\" Varin said, but added it was not up to him to comment on any potential counteroffers. People close to the deal have played down prospects for a counteroffer, although some bankers think the combined entity could be an attractive takeover target one day. Corus shares traded at 470.50 pence at 1028 GMT, suggesting the market still factored in prospects for a higher offer. Varin pointed out that Tata\\'s bid represented a 26 percent premium to Corus\\'s share price over the past 12 months. A six-person committee, evenly divided among representatives of the companies and led by Tata Steel Chairman Ratan Tata, would drive the integration, Varin said. He declined to discuss potential synergies from the transaction. Asked about job cuts, he said the deal was more about growth than about reducing Corus\\'s 47,000 staff. The deal, India\\'s largest ever foreign takeover, extends a wave of consolidation in the fragmented steel sector and follows Mittal Steel\\'s $33 billion acquisition of rival Arcelor this year. Consolidation in the steel sector is set to continue, said Varin, who is also head of European steel association Eurofer. He cited China and Russia in particular as places where merger activity could accelerate, but said more steps were also possible in Europe. Varin said he was confident that demand for steel in Europe would remain strong but added the sector had to keep an eye on imports from China and on energy prices.',\n",

In the monthly IEA report, the advisor to 26 industrialized countries said stockpiles in OECD countries grew by 1.15 million barrels per day in the third quarter, the biggest third-quarter rise since 1991. The IEA also said the world\\'s demand for crude oil from OPEC will fall by about 500,000 bpd due to growth in production from non-OPEC nations -- a factor that could dull the impact of OPEC\\'s recent output cuts. \"There were a lot of negatives in the IEA report but the two that stand out were the Q3 oil stock build of 1.15 million barrels per day, the highest Q3 increase since 1991, and the call on OPEC crude reduced by half a million bpd,\" said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president, Macquarie Futures USA. Tempering the weakness in the market, the IEA added that world\\'s thirst for oil will rise 2.4 million bpd in the last three months of this year from the third quarter, 400,000 bpd higher than forecast last month. Friday\\'s losses come after oil prices had rallied on Thursday, supported by OPEC supply cuts that came into effect this month and a drop in fuel stocks last week in the United States, the world\\'s top oil consumer. Gulf members of OPEC said on Wednesday they were fully committed to the 1.2 million bpd supply cut agreed from November, but said markets remained oversupplied for now. The producer group next meets on December 14, and some members have said they see scope for a further cut in supply then. U.S. weekly data showed a 2.7 million-barrel fall in distillate stocks, stirring concerns over heating fuel supplies as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.

( XOM.N ), which limited a broader market advance. The Nasdaq turned in its best weekly performance in two months, with strong results this week from technology bellwethers such as Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ), the Internet network equipment maker. Healthy profits and outlooks from big tech companies helped push the Nasdaq up on Thursday to 2,401.33, its highest level in almost six years. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 5.13 points, or 0.04 percent, to finish Friday at 12,108.43, after shifting to a slight gain for the day in the session\\'s final minutes.

AIG said its results benefited from an absence of major hurricanes hitting the United States this year. But shares of Disney dropped 3.5 percent, or $1.18, to $32.40 on the NYSE, dragging on both the Dow and the S&P 500. Disney, the No. 2 U.S. entertainment company and a Dow component, posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit late on Thursday.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bids are due in the coming days for Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), the largest U.S. radio company, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday. \\n\\n Clear Channel, which has about 1,150 stations, said last month in response to reports that it was considering offers to be taken private that it had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) to help it evaluate strategic alternatives. Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters at that time that two private equity consortiums were looking at bidding for the company, which has a market valuation of more than $17 billion based on Thursday\\'s closing price of $34.67. Private equity groups Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone BG.UL and KKR KKR.UL make up one consortium. The rival group consists of Bain Capital, Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL and Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL. Other parties have been speculated to be interested. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Apollo Management and Carlyle, and Cerberus Capital and Oak Hill Partners were two other bidding groups, but that these had largely faded from the process. It was unclear which day the bids were due, with various media reports saying final bids were due either Friday or Monday. The Financial Times and Wall Street Journal reported that final bids could lead to a deal being announced as early as next week. One source familiar with the situation told Reuters that final bids were due in the coming days. A separate source said that bids were due by Monday. KKR and Blackstone declined comment, as did Thomas H. Lee, Texas Pacific and Bain. Providence and Goldman Sachs were not available for comment. Clear Channel declined comment. Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, Texas, last week forecast strong fourth-quarter radio advertising sales and posted a 9.5 percent drop in third-quarter profit, reflecting the spin-off of its entertainment unit. The company is a dominant player in many U.S. radio markets, where it often owns a number of stations playing different formats from music to talk. Advertising-driven radio broadcasters such as Clear Channel have been challenged to develop new formats and technology in the face of growing competition from satellite radio, the Internet and personal digital music players. Private equity firms typically buy companies with a small portion of their own cash and borrow the rest. They usually hold a business for 3 to 5 years, restructure it, and sell it later either to a buyer or on the open market in an initial public offering. Sometimes buyout firms \"flip\" an investment in a year or less when they think they can make a good profit on the sale. (Additional reporting by  Sue Zeidler  in Los Angeles)',\n",
       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) said on Thursday its profit doubled, thanks to growth from its theme parks and movies and TV shows such as \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and \"High School Musical\", but its shares fell 2 percent after touching a five-year high. \\n\\n Disney said U.S. hotel bookings were flat in the current quarter, and some analysts said investors were concerned the company would not be able to maintain its growth spurt. \"They had an absolutely outstanding year and it\\'s just going to be hard to beat that,\" David Miller of Sanders Morris Harris said. \"When you\\'re this large, it\\'s hard to grow fast.\" The shares on Thursday had hit their highest level since mid-2001, and were trading at a small premium to Disney peers. Expectations for Disney have risen since Chief Executive Robert Iger took over last year and began an aggressive series of moves such as buying Pixar Animation Studios, making cuts at the film unit, and offering content for sale on the Internet. Disney reported a fourth-quarter net profit of $782 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with $379 million, or 19 cents per share, a year before. Revenue rose 14 percent to $8.8 billion. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 33 cents per share and revenue of $8.7 billion for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Disney does not give quarterly forecasts, but this year it projected double-digit earnings per share growth through 2008. Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said hotel bookings at domestic parks for the quarter to December were in line with a year ago, when Disney had record holiday attendance. \"I think that (they) over-delivered on fiscal 2006 and people are thinking, \\'How do we get to that double-digit growth for fiscal 2007?\\'\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeff Logsdon said. In the fiscal fourth quarter, studio entertainment posted the biggest rise in revenue of all Disney units, growing 33 percent to $2.0 billion, and turned an operating profit of $214 million, compared with a $313 million loss a year earlier. Media networks revenue, boosted by higher advertising rates at sports network ESPN and for ABC primetime hits such as \"Desperate Housewives\" and \"Lost,\" were up 10 percent and operating profit rose by 18 percent to $883 million. Iger told analysts on a conference call that Disney was close to signing a long-term programming deal with Compacts Corp. ( CMCSA.O ) in the next week, in which Disney would provide access to its main products like ESPN and the Disney Channel. Iger said Disney may also create unique material for Compacts. Another pending deal, the sale of ABC radio assets to Citadel Broadcasting Corp. CDL.N, was expected to close in the first half of calendar 2007, Staggs said, adding that Disney discussed possible modifications to the deal to facilitate Citadel\\'s post-closing financing. Spot TV ad sales were \"solid\" in the current quarter, with primetime ad rates pacing ahead of 2006 advance ad rates by low single digits, Staggs said. Ad sales at Disney owned-and-operated TV stations were up by double-digit percentages this quarter due to political advertising. Attendance rose at parks and resorts in the fourth quarter, along with per capita spending and hotel occupancy, driving up division revenue by 8 percent and operating income by 28 percent to $396 million. Consumer products revenue rose 9 percent, while operating profit rose 1 percent over a year ago to $139 million. Fiscal 2007 earnings drivers include a third installment of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and the Disney-Pixar animated film \"Ratatouille.\" Disney plans to lift capital expenditure by $400 million to $500 million in 2007, with about half for park improvements and much of the remainder on new media initiatives at ESPN, Staggs said. Spending on video game development would rise 30 percent in fiscal 2007, he said. Disney was looking for Internet and download revenues of about $700 million in fiscal 2007. The stock rose 28 percent in fiscal 2006 and 8 percent last quarter and traded on Thursday at 19.6 times estimated fiscal 2007 profit, while Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) trades at 19.4 times forward earnings and Viacom Inc. VIA.N at 17.5. Disney shares fell to $32.89 in after-hours trading from a close of $33.58.',\n",
       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - After a busy first year spent buying Pixar Animation Studios and slashing costs, Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) Chief Executive Bob Iger is under pressure to produce a strong second act to keep profit growth in double-digits. \\n\\n Quarterly results on Thursday pleased the Wall Street crowd, and Disney reiterated a double-digit earnings growth forecast for the fiscal year that opened in October. But investors sold off the stock on Friday on worries about whether Disney\\'s performance will continue to justify a stock price that hit a five-year high the previous day. \"Disney is selling off because people are afraid it\\'s going to be hard to do an encore,\" said Jim Awad, chairman of Awad Asset Management in New York. A number of analysts said on Friday, however, that they expect Disney to maintain the strong growth, given its holiday DVD releases, the next \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film in the summer and strength at the parks and television units. Iger took over last October from Michael Eisner, who after early success left with a mixed legacy from 21 years as CEO. Prudential Equity analyst Katherine Styponias wrote that she still saw Disney as the \"best strategically and financially managed company in our entertainment coverage universe.\" She wrote in a note that she saw a greater chance of Disney exceeding Wall Street\\'s fiscal 2007 targets than missing them. Analysts also forecast increases in advertising revenue in 2007 at Disney\\'s top-rated ABC TV network and its ESPN sports cable network, which lately has enjoyed record ratings for its Monday Night Football franchise. Lower pension costs coupled with higher ticket prices and per-capita spending at Disney\\'s theme parks could offset difficult comparisons with last year\\'s record attendance from Disneyland\\'s 50th Anniversary celebration promotions. \"Performance of Disney\\'s U.S. theme parks is the biggest concern,\" Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"Given strong booking trends in (the first quarter of 2007) and continued high occupancy rates, we do not expect a deterioration in the coming year.\" The company on Thursday reported flat advance bookings at domestic parks for the current quarter versus last year\\'s record-setting holiday attendance. Sanders Morris Harris analyst David Miller had warned clients in a note that the market might \"penalize\" Disney on Friday since investors were used to seeing annual growth in advance bookings in the \"high-single digits\". Analysts were counting on Disney\\'s summer movies, including Disney-Pixar\\'s \"Ratatouille\" and a third \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" as well as DVD sales for \"Cars\" and the second \"Pirates\". Lower overhead and marketing costs from staff and film output cuts would further strengthen the studio division. Miller reiterated a \"hold\" rating on Disney shares and raised his fiscal 2007 earnings forecast, but said the stock was not as \"blatantly attractive\" as it was earlier this year. Disney stock is now up 35 percent this year, and trades at nearly 20 times estimated fiscal 2007 earnings, roughly in line with rivals News Corp. NWSa.N, and Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ). Reif Cohen, who has a \"buy\" rating on Disney, said in her note that she anticipated \"continued operating momentum and an attractive long-term growth profile will drive the stock.\" Disney shares fell 3.5 percent to $32.40 on Friday.

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Richard Branson, the biggest shareholder of UK cable operator NTL Inc. NTLI.O, has thrown his support behind a merger with broadcaster ITV ( ITV.L ), a person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday. \\n\\n In the increasingly cutthroat market for TV and Internet customers, Branson believes a deal would create a stronger rival to satellite operator BSkyB ( BSY.L ), added the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"He\\'s quite excited about it,\" the source said. Branson became NTL\\'s largest shareholder with about a 12 percent stake and a seat on the board after he sold Virgin Mobile to the cable operator earlier this year. A spokesman for the billionaire enterpreneur\\'s Virgin Group could not immediately be reached. W.R. Huff Asset Management Co., another major NTL shareholder, also was briefed on the approach to ITV ahead of time and endorsed it, another source familiar with the situation said. A call to Huff\\'s offices in Morristown, New Jersey, was not returned. A combination of the two companies would give NTL access to ITV\\'s library of programs to distribute over its TV, Internet and mobile phone services. INITIAL MEETING NTL said on Thursday that it had approached ITV and scheduled an initial meeting to talk about merging the companies. ITV confirmed receipt of a \"highly tentative expression of interest\" from NTL, and said it was willing to listen. ITV\\'s shares were down 1.3 percent at 110 1/2 pence at 1210 GMT. They had risen as much as 8 percent on Thursday before closing with a 6.2 percent gain, at 112 pence. NTL shares dropped 2.5 percent to $26.59 on the Nasdaq on Thursday. NTL\\'s approach surprised many in the industry, with analysts struggling to see the rationale for such a deal. ITV has been struggling with a dismal advertising market and losing viewers to the growing number of digital channels offered in Britain. It is also without a CEO after Charles Allen stepped down earlier this year. NTL has also been tackling the integration of both fellow cable operator Telewest and Virgin Mobile. It will rebrand itself Virgin Media in early 2007. The New York-listed cable TV, Internet and telephone service provider said it had recorded a net loss of 37,300 customers in the third quarter. The company has 3.3 million customers using its pay-TV service, 4.2 million taking the telephone service and 3 million taking broadband. BSkyB said last week it had 8.2 million subscribers to its pay-TV service, following a net increase of 82,000 in the first quarter, which was its highest first-quarter net subscriber growth since 2003. It has signed up 74,000 customers to its new broadband service which was launched in July and has around 1 million registrations of interest.

TNOX.O as planned. \\n\\n \"If Genentech is successful in acquiring Tanox, our rights in this partnership will not change and any royalties paid to Tanox will then be paid to Genentech,\" Novartis spokesman John Gilardi said. \"Our rights under this agreement will not change.\" Genentech, which is majority owned by Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ), said on Thursday it plans to buy Tanox for about $919 million to boost income from the anti-asthma treatment. Genentech, Tanox and Novartis have been working together since 1996 to develop and market the drug. Genentech said that by acquiring Tanox it would eliminate royalties it pays to Tanox in connection with Xolair, a treatment for moderate to severe allergic asthma. Novartis\\'s current royalty payments to Tanox will go to Genentech if the deal goes through, but there will be no change in the amounts, Gilardi said. Novartis shares had fallen in early trade on Friday on concerns that the planned Tanox deal might affect Novartis\\'s royalty payments from the drug. Stocks were also hit by U.S. election results, as gains by Democrats could hurt the drug sector if the party fulfils a promise to let Medicare negotiate lower prices for medicines.',\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. cut prices on small appliances including microwaves and coffee makers on Friday, the latest in a series of markdowns aimed at luring customers during the vital holiday shopping period. \\n\\n The world\\'s biggest retailer, which had previously lowered prices on key toys and electronics, also said it would offer \"special values\" on a holiday collection from its trendy Metro 7 clothing line, which posted sluggish sales in recent month. The moves come as Wal-Mart looks for ways to reinvigorate growth after back-to-back months of disappointing sales. Remodeling projects disrupted hundreds of its U.S. stores, and Metro 7 clothing sold poorly. Wal-Mart executives told analysts last month that they were not satisfied with the recent sales performance, but remained confident that aggressive price cuts would revive growth during the November-December holiday season, the biggest shopping period of the year. The latest markdowns were taken on almost 50 small appliances and included a Mr. Coffee 12-cup programmable coffee maker for $37.88, down from $42.48, and a Sharp .08 cubic foot microwave reduced to $49.88 from $54.88. CIBC analyst Joseph Altobello said the price cuts were already factored into earnings expectations for Jarden Corp., which makes Mr. Coffee. Jarden\\'s shares were up 12 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $36.16 in midday New York Stock Exchange trading. The Metro 7 women\\'s apparel prices included a \"faux\" fur vest for $19.94, and a leather jacket for $59.94. Wal-Mart launched Metro 7 one year ago, and reported very strong demand when it was tested in a few hundred stores. But sales have not met Wal-Mart\\'s expectations since it rolled it out to more locations, and the retailer recently acknowledged that it probably expanded too far, too fast. Wal-Mart had previously lowered prices on products ranging from plasma televisions to board games, raising concerns of a price war and pressuring shares of rival retailers. The retailer said it would continue to roll back prices this holiday season, and listed toys, electronics and apparel as the key categories. Wal-Mart\\'s stock, which had fallen nearly 6 percent this month after disappointing October sales, was up 9 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $46.48 on the NYSE.

The breakthrough removes an irritant in the U.S.-Russia relationship, but is likely to set off a fight in the new Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress next year over a key provision of the deal. It comes just a few days before Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Bush meet in Moscow and again at an Asia-Pacific regional summit next week in Hanoi. U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab and Russian Trade Minister German Gref are expected to sign the new pact at the summit. \"Our agreements with the United States are of a very balanced character,\" Gref told reporters in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk during a stopover on his way from Shanghai to Moscow. \"We have managed to reach compromise and understanding with our partners on all the issues of paramount importance to us,\" he said. U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said the Bush administration was still consulting with members of Congress about details of the agreement in principle, but called it \"a clear indication of Russia\\'s effort to participate fully in and benefit from the rules-based global trading system.\" HOME STRETCH U.S. business groups welcomed the pact, which Schwab\\'s office said removes longstanding Russian obstacles to U.S. beef, pork and poultry exports and requires Moscow to cut tariffs on a long list of agricultural and manufactured goods. Russia also agreed to open up its services sector, including in the politically-sensitive area of banking and insurance, and to take stronger action to stop piracy and counterfeiting of foreign goods before it joins the WTO. The deal sets the stage for a potential battle in Congress next year to extend \"permanent normal trade relations\" to Russia by removing a Cold War provision known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment. That legislation linked normal trade relations with communist countries to the rights of Jews and other religious minorities to emigrate. It remains on the books for Russia even though it has not been applied for years. Democrats, who captured Congress from Republicans in elections this week, have taken a more skeptical view of trade agreements. Russia had hoped to announce a WTO deal with the United States at the summit of the G8 group of leading industrialized nations in St Petersburg in July but was unable to overcome the negotiating hurdles. Dan Glickman, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" the agreement requires Russia to bring its copyright laws and enforcement system into line with WTO intellectual property rights rules. Keith Rockwell, a spokesman for the WTO in Geneva, welcomed the breakthrough but cautioned that Russia may not make it into the club as quickly as many expect. China, he said, took 20 months to get in after completing its bilateral deals. \"Even after Russia completes all its bilaterals, it must still gain consensus from the multilateral Working Party, where much work remains to be done and where some complications have arisen,\" Rockwell told Reuters. Arkady Dvorkovich, head of the Kremlin\\'s economic staff, said Russia could wrap up a final entry deal within months. \"It\\'s in the interests of Russia because we receive the opportunity to operate in foreign markets, and introduce foreign countries to the Russian market on the basis of established rules,\" he told Reuters. \"Our foreign partners ... will be able to work in the Russian market on the basis of better-known, more-defined rules. We are already used to tough competition, so our companies have nothing to fear.\" Accession would stimulate Russian service industries such as telecoms, banking and insurance, and encourage reforms by Russian companies, said Peter Westin, chief economist at MDM-Bank in Moscow.

All of Ford\\'s blue-collar workers represented by the United Auto Workers union have been offered buyout packages to leave the company\\'s payroll. Those offers, which are central to Ford\\'s plan to cut costs in response to its sliding market share, are open to consideration until November 27. \"I would say we are a little bit ahead (of schedule),\" Mulally told the Detroit Free Press. \"We\\'re getting a really good response about the way we\\'re doing it and that they have choices and they can do it in a timely manner and move on or stay.\" Ford\\'s larger rival, General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), surprised Wall Street analysts earlier this year when it convinced some 28,000 of its unionized workers to take a similar buyout package. Some industry observers had questioned whether Ford would have equivalent success with the program given that its workforce is younger on average than GM\\'s. \\'LEVERAGE AND SIMPLIFY\\' Separately, Mulally said in his interviews with the Detroit newspapers that he had not decided whether to shed some of Ford\\'s car brands. But he indicated that there was potential to cut costs by streamlining Ford\\'s management and planning process. \"There is no plan to do that tomorrow,\" he told the Detroit News. \"But we have got to leverage and simplify and use the resources we have around the world.\" The Detroit Free Press quoted Mulally as saying he saw unlimited potential to save money by simplifying and unifying Ford\\'s operating structure, which is now broken up by geography and product line. \"We have a lot of opportunity to improve.

       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) hopes to capture up to 40 percent of the customers for its new Buick Enclave from rival brands as it pushes to reestablish Buick in the luxury car market, a spokesman said on Friday. \\n\\n \"We are very encouraged we will draw customers from competitors,\" Buick spokesman Dave Darovitz said. \"It could be as high as 40 percent, although it\\'s always hard to put a number on that.\" The 2008 Enclave, a five-door luxury crossover sport utility vehicle, will compete with Honda Motor Co. Ltd\\'s ( 7267.T ) Acura MDX, Toyota Motor Corp.\\'s ( 7203.T ) Lexus RX 350 and DaimlerChrysler AG\\'s DCXGn.DE Mercedes R Class 350. While Buick has not announced the pricing of the model yet, Darovitz said the new Enclave would be \"several thousand dollars cheaper\" than the 2007 Acura MDX, which has a base price of $39,995. The world\\'s largest automaker will use cutting-edge soundproofing technology to make the vehicle one of the quietest on the road, Darovitz said. Global Insight analyst George Magliano said he had \"very high\" expectations for the Enclave because of its fuel efficiency and smooth ride. \"GM is basically is moving into a segment all on its own,\" he said, referring to the large crossover SUV segment. Sales of car-based \"crossover\" utility vehicles -- which offer the high ride and roomy cabins of an SUV with the handling and fuel mileage of a passenger car -- are on track to reach 2.4 million units this year, according to analysts. The segment has been one of the few bright spots in a slowing U.S. auto market. Overall sales have dropped 3 percent so far this year and many analysts expect the slump to deepen in 2007. GM, which lost $10.6 billion last year, is trying to reverse a slide in market share in part by more sharply differentiating its eight brands to reduce the overlap of models. GM is working to group the GMC and Buick brands under one dealership, making Buick the luxury brand. Buick\\'s U.S. sales fell 15 percent in the first 10 months of 2006. \"The Enclave will bring Buick back,\" Darovitz said. GM will build the Enclave at a plant near Lansing, Michigan. The new vehicle goes on sale in mid-2007, but GM will unveil the production version this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Golf star Tiger Woods, who signed a five year promotional deal with GM, is expected to be central to the marketing effort for the Enclave, which GM hopes will take Buick to a younger and more affluent set of buyers. IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle said the Enclave showed the strength of GM\\'s pipeline of launches under the automaker\\'s product chief Bob Lutz. \"The Enclave is really the first true Lutz product for Buick,\" Merkle said. Merkle expected the three GM crossovers that share the same platform -- the Outlook, Acadia and Enclave -- could sell over 200,000 units in their first year on a combined basis. \"What\\'s important is that they finally have some crossovers that are going to be profitable,\" he said of GM. Merkle said a full revival for the Buick brand would depend on the launch of new sedans for the brand that are not expected to arrive until 2009. \"The Enclave is definitely a huge leap in the right direction,\" he said.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - It\\'s time to update the way you give to charity. \\n\\n Americans are as charitable as they\\'ve ever been, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Last year they donated some $62.7 billion to the largest U.S. charities -- matching the highest year-over-year percentage gain in gifts since the publication started tracking those numbers 16 years ago. But donors are different than they used to be. The idea of just writing one check to United Way is far less popular than it once was. So is the idea of sending dozens of small checks of $15 for every group\\'s appeal that arrives in your mailbox. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -- created by the Microsoft chairman and his family to help reduce inequities around the world -- has inspired many to start planning their donations the way they plan their retirements. At the same time, Congress used this year\\'s pension legislation to tighten up the tax rules governing charitable gifts. Starting in 2007, the Internal Revenue Service will not allow write-offs for cash donations unless they are documented. Instead of tossing cash into that Salvation Army bucket, you\\'ll have to write a check. And remember to save your checking account statement, since your bank probably isn\\'t sending back your canceled checks anymore. Here\\'s what you can do now to make sure your donations (and your tax deductions) work the way you want them to. -- Give now, choose later with a charitable gift fund run by a mutual fund company or broker. It\\'s significant that the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund (www.charitablegift.org/) was the sixth-biggest donation-getter in 2005, according to the Chronicle\\'s figures. This fund and others like it run like this: The mutual fund itself is organized as a charitable organization. You can open an account and give it a name like \"The Smith Family Fund\" for instance. When you contribute to your account, you get a tax deduction for the amount of your contributions. You can leave the money there as long as you want and add to it whenever you want. It gets invested and grows. When you are ready to donate some or all of it, you simply let Fidelity know and the company cuts a check on your behalf. The charity knows it\\'s you (or not, as you wish), but you don\\'t get any additional tax break for the check that goes to the charity. Funds like this are also run by Charles Schwab (www.schwabcharitable.org/), T. Rowe Price (www.programforgiving.org/), and Vanguard Investments (www.vanguardcharitable.org/). These vehicles are good, and getting better. Fidelity recently lowered its minimum opening balance requirements to $5,000, and T. Rowe Price recently dropped the management fees on its Program for Charitable Giving to 0.5 percent a year; the lowest of all the major programs. To get an idea of how a program like this could work for you, think about this: Donate $5,000 a year to the fund, but don\\'t take anything out for 10 years. If your account earns 8 percent a year, in the 11th year you\\'ll have close to $90,000 to give away. That may be more than you\\'d ever give away all at once, but it would enable you to make a very big change at any charity of your choice. And it allows you to hurry up your deduction this year but take as much time as you want in choosing your charity. -- Give securities. If you\\'ve got earnings on a taxable investment, give the investment to charity before you sell it. You can even use shares of a mutual fund to start one of those charitable gift accounts. It works like this: Say you paid $6,000 for some shares of stock, and now it\\'s worth $10,000. You can transfer the shares to a charity, which gets to sell them tax-free. You get the full $10,000 charitable deduction. If you sold the shares first, you\\'d have to pay capital gains taxes on the $4,000 profit, reducing your deductible gift to $9,400, not counting any commission you\\'d have to pay. -- Give fewer, more generous gifts. You might have a number of favorite charities, but try to limit that. Figure out which causes mean the most to you before you decide whom to fund, and then focus on those causes. Giving small amounts to many charities mutes the impact of your gift and encourages myriad charities to spend more and more money trying to get more out of you. -- Consider giving some money to a local community foundation or charity. Smaller bucks can go further in hometown charities like hunger and children\\'s programs. They often have lower overhead than big national organizations. You can watch your money at work. -- Do your due diligence. Check out your chosen charities at  www.guidestar.org  to make sure they are legit before you write those checks. -- Learn the difference between spending and giving. Before the recent mid-term elections, you might have sent money to the party and candidates of your choice, but that\\'s not tax deductible charitable spending; it\\'s just politics. Giving to your church does count as a charitable gift; buying Girl Scout Cookies, not so much. -- Do write the checks. You\\'ll want a record of how much you gave and when. Not just for your tax return, either. It\\'s a safe bet that whatever charity you favor will be calling or writing within weeks to ask for more, so it would be nice to be able to say, \"I just did that.\" \\n(Linda Stern is a freelance writer.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Most investors choose their stocks and mutual funds carefully -- and then forget about them. \\n\\n They add to the mix without subtracting. Years go by, and they may look at their statements and say: \"When did I buy that?\" or \"I still own that?\" Folks, it\\'s time to prune. The end of the year is the perfect time to organize what you own and get rid of what you no longer want. Here\\'s how: -- Put it on your calendar. Start by setting aside a block of time, say a couple of hours, to collect the information you need and set guidelines for analyzing your investments. You can review everything you own in one marathon session, or devote 30 minutes every day to review one or two investments. -- Start by examining your investment philosophy and goals. Do you believe you can choose stocks and actively managed funds that beat the indexes? Or do you believe that less managing means lower fees and eventually a better performance? Are you saving for the long term or stashing away money you\\'ll need within five years for college or a down payment? Once you answer these questions, you\\'ll have a clearer idea of how individual securities fit - or don\\'t fit - your plans. -- Do a tax analysis, or ask your broker to do one for you. Sell securities that will produce a loss that you can use on your tax return. This may mean selling your entire holding of a stock, or selling only certain identified shares of a mutual fund. -- Look for duplication. Do you have five stock funds that all seem to be dominated by shares of Pfizer, General Electric, Home Depot and Citigroup? Unless you can find a good reason why you own so many different funds that act similarly, sell the four that are less worthy (perhaps they have weaker performances or higher fees) and consolidate that money into the best fund. What about multiple stocks that achieve the same portfolio goal? Maybe you like bank stocks, and so you own several different ones. That\\'s OK. On the other hand, if you find yourself buying various versions of what\\'s essentially the same stock over and over again, pick the best and prune the rest. -- Would you buy it now? That\\'s the toughest question investors have to ask themselves because they get emotionally involved in the stocks that they own. But evaluate your holdings by the same criteria that caused you to buy them. Are they still attractively priced? Is the company\\'s story still persuasive? Is it a good value, relative to its cash on hand, its earnings and other companies in its same niche? If the answer to all of your questions is \"no,\" then maybe the next thing you say should be \"sell.\" -- Find a balance. Theoretically, your portfolio is structured to fit a certain asset allocation. You may have initially decided, for example, to have 40 percent in large U.S. stocks, 20 percent in small U.S. stocks, 20 percent in foreign stocks and 20 percent in bonds. But every year, that gets skewed when some asset classes do well and others don\\'t. This year, your foreign funds and your large-cap stock funds have probably far outstripped your small companies and your bonds. You may find you want to get rid of some of the winning shares and invest more in securities where the price is right. -- Give away stock. Want to get rid of some shares that will produce a taxable gain? Here are a couple of alternatives. Give the stock to your college-student children instead of tuition. If they\\'re over 18, they can sell it, pay a tax based on their (presumably lower) income tax rate, and then use the proceeds to make that tuition payment. Or give the shares to the charity of your choice instead of writing a check. You\\'ll get the full deduction, and your charity won\\'t have to pay taxes on the proceeds. -- Start looking for your next purchase. Discover any holes in your portfolio? Now you know what to shop for in the new year. \\n(Linda Stern is a freelance writer. Any opinions in the column \\nare solely those of Ms. Stern.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The stock options scandal has led to the resignations of more than two dozen U.S. executives, but some companies in the crosshairs don\\'t seem particularly eager to cast off their fallen leaders. \\n\\n Some corporate chiefs are staying on the payroll for weeks, or longer, after stepping down in the wake of probes into options award practices. Others have relinquished their executive posts but are being hired temporarily as consultants; deals that advocates of good corporate governance say can be rife with problems regardless of the circumstances of a CEO\\'s departure. \"If you are an investor, you have no idea the extent of hours and the value you are getting for this consulting,\" said Louis Malizia, assistant director of the Capital Strategies Department at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a frequent critic of lofty CEO pay. \"It\\'s very lucrative, and who knows the extent of the work?\" he said. Corporate America\\'s practice of doling out option grants to top executives is being examined by regulators, the IRS and the U.S. Justice Department. Much of the focus is on backdating, which allows recipients the opportunity to reap extra profits. When boards allow executives tied to options problems to stay on -- even temporarily -- they are sending a mixed message to investors about the seriousness of the problem, said Paul Hodgson, an analyst at the Corporate Library, a corporate governance research firm. \"The whole point of them leaving in the first place is removing the taint of scandal from the company,\" he said. \"If they are staying on as a consultant, then the taint has not been removed at all.\" In one of the highest-profile executive departures linked to options probes so far, UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) CEO William McGuire resigned as chairman and as a director last month after the company said it found evidence of backdated options. But McGuire is keeping the CEO title until on or before December 1. The health insurer is trying to hammer out the terms of his departure, but as of earlier this week it said it still had reached no agreement with him. A company spokesman was not immediately available for additional comment. At information security company SafeNet Inc. SFNT.O, two top executives resigned on October 18 after an internal review found instances of backdated option grants, but they will remain employees until year\\'s end. Both executives, ex-chairman and CEO Anthony Caputo and ex-acting financial chief Carole Argo, each will receive their base salary and certain employee benefits during that time. In Argo\\'s case, she can keep her company car while she remains an employee, according to a regulatory filing. The board has set a March 29 date to determine the terms of the two executives\\' exits, the filing said. SafeNet spokeswoman Donna St. Germain said the two executives would be \"consulting on various things\" and would help the company in \"making a smooth transition.\" \"They haven\\'t been found of doing anything wrong, and they have been such a part of making the company what it is,\" she said. MIXED SIGNALS TO INVESTORS? Several companies caught in options probes have disclosed formal consulting contracts with outgoing chiefs. At Sapient Corp. ( SAPE.O ), CEO Jerry Greenberg resigned last month after the company found errors related to options grants. According to a regulatory filing, he was hired as a $750-an-hour consultant for an \"initial term\" of one year. The company also signed a one-year consulting deal with former interim CFO Susan Cooke, who quit following the probe. A company representative was not immediately available to comment on the agreements. Biotechnology firm Medarex Inc. MEDX.O is in a consulting deal with its former president and chief executive, Donald Drakeman, who stepped down from those posts this week after an options review. Drakeman will be an employee until January 4 and after that will be a paid consultant until March 25. The deal calls for him to be paid $69,825 a month for no more than 15 hours of work each week. Medarex spokeswoman Jean Mantuano said the arrangement is designed \"basically to assist in an orderly transition.\" The Corporate Library\\'s Hodgson said such consulting contracts should not be necessary, though, if companies have succession plans in place. Help with management transition should only be necessary \"when the CEO resigns suddenly,\" he said. \"And that\\'s usually when something has gone wrong, so the last thing you want is access to that CEO\" through a consulting deal, he said. But others say it\\'s always helpful for a company to tap into a seasoned executive\\'s knowledge. In the case of Medarex, \"Drakeman has been a huge part of the success of this company,\" said Joseph Pappo, a fund manager at Lotsoff Capital Management, which holds the stock in its portfolio. The consulting deal \"does not bother me.\"',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Big buyout deals can come with their own problems aside from getting financing, industry experts say, which can derail plans before they even hit the negotiating table. \\n\\n Antitrust and regulation issues can be harder to overcome with mega-sized deals -- as seen recently when a $50 billion bid approach to French conglomerate Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) fell apart partly over tax issues, according to sources last week. In addition, breaking up a conglomerate or spinning it off whole at a higher price is a tougher job with a bigger deal. That\\'s on top of concerns about the increased risk taken on as financial sponsors pay higher prices as targets become more scarce. Multi-billion dollar leveraged buyouts (LBOs) have become the norm as high liquidity in the global financial system has sent cash rushing into the private equity sector. Deal size has rocketed as financial sponsors club together on bids, with a buyout group recently clinching a $21 billion deal to buy No. 1. U.S. hospital operator HCA Inc. ( HCA.N ). \"The sheer enormity of those numbers are frankly scary,\" said Anthony Sabino, Professor of Law & Business at St. John\\'s University. \"When you\\'re talking deals of that size, you\\'re talking debt of that size. It\\'s larger than that of many sovereign nations. It\\'s dangerous.\" BIG DEAL, HIGH RISK Sabino argues that the bigger the deal, the higher the risk, and that even buying a large, well-established company doesn\\'t eliminate concern about debt taken on. But the sheer scale of deals being drawn up raises wider issues than simply getting the cash lined up. Vivendi said on Saturday that private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL had been interested in buying its business but talks had ended. Talks were abandoned partly because of French tax laws and other complications, according to a source at the time, as the deal would require approvals of several governments including France. Pushing a big deal through different regulatory jurisdictions creates complexity that an LBO of a smaller company with less established overseas operations may not encounter. Issues can also arise as private equity shops build up their own portfolios and consolidate new acquisitions with existing companies. \"Evidently the larger companies are going to be facing larger anti-trust issues,\" said Howard Morgan, managing director of private equity firm Castle Harlan Inc., which invests in medium-sized deals. Exiting a mega-deal can be more problematic than smaller LBOs, as sponsors look to either break the company up or sell it whole to a new consortium, said Peter Spratt, managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers Corporate Advisory and Restructuring. DEBT WORRIES Global acquisitions by private equity firms totaled $554 billion so far this year, up from $354 billion for the full year 2005 and only $72 billion in 2001, according to research firm Dealogic. The price buyout firms are paying for companies has also risen -- making it harder to achieve high returns. This year, financial sponsors have paid an average 19.2 times companies\\' earnings, versus 15.3 times earnings in 2005 and 11.4 in 2001. Levering a company up with debt diminishes its ability to deal with bumps in performance, said Steven Siesser, Chairman of law firm Lowenstein Sandler\\'s specialty finance group. \"With the super-mega deals you\\'ve got larger bank groups who are probably less forgiving on covenant default -- that makes it more difficult and harder for these companies to weather any hiccups in their natural cycle,\" Siesser said. Spratt expects to see restructurings ahead, with over-leveraged companies missing targets and falling into distressed situations. He said PwC has the critical mass in terms of staffing to deal with at least \"the first wave\". Sabino also foresees rough water. \"There\\'s still too much good money that\\'s going to be chasing bad deals. The low-hanging fruit has already been picked and I don\\'t know what\\'s on the top of the tree.\" The pitfalls won\\'t stop the flow of deal ideas, but might cut the amount that are completed. \"From the time the deal is sufficiently public to completion I think the failure rate is probably relatively small,\" said PwC\\'s Spratt. \"The things we don\\'t see is the failure rate of the initial concepts as they\\'re bandied around over the dinner table between various hedge funds -- and I suspect that failure rate is pretty high.\"',\n",
       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - If watching soap operas is your passion, then fantasy game designer Erica Salmon is betting Fantasy Soap League will become your sport. \\n\\n The Walt Disney Co.\\'s SoapNet announced the Web-based fantasy site on Friday at its annual Super Soap Weekend in Florida in a bid to attract women aged 18 to 34, and add a social dimension to the six-year-old soap TV channel. The game works along the same lines as fantasy football, in which real-life players are chosen for virtual teams and results are based on statistics from actual games. Fantasy Soap players will pick three male and three female actors and five \"soapy moments\" from nine U.S. network soaps, and score points depending on what the actors\\' characters do. Taking off clothing, waking up from a coma, getting an organ transplant, day dreaming or \"monologuing\" -- when an actor stands alone in a room talking to himself -- are each worth a hefty 50 points in Fantasy Soap League. Kissing or slapping someone, pleading, lurking or eavesdropping can also boost scores. Players also win points if any of the five \"soapy moments\" they choose occur on any soap opera over a 10-week period. During the site\\'s six-week test, the top-earning character, Fancy Crane of \"Passions\", scored big for being held prisoner by a murderer. The site, www.soapnet.go.com/fantasy/, was available for signup on Friday and points start accruing on November 13. It costs $9.99 to play for 10 weeks. Salmon and the Soap Squad, a nine-member team who monitor the soaps daily and count up points for the game, came up with the point system based on similarities in all soap plot lines. \"The game is only fun when you\\'re earning points,\" said Salmon, who launched her own Fantasy Fashion League last year as an answer to her boyfriend\\'s addiction to fantasy sports. SoapNet General Manager Deborah Blackwell said the Fantasy Soap idea was in the works for two years, spurred in part by the success of sister network ESPN\\'s Fantasy Football League. Like ESPN, SoapNet enjoys a high degree of viewer loyalty, according to Nielsen ratings, and the soap network wanted to emulate ESPN\\'s robust online presence as well. \"We saw how much fun ESPN viewers have with Fantasy Football,\" Blackwell said. \"The game rewards people for something they already are doing and it encourages sampling of other soaps.\" ESPN began offering fantasy sports online in 2005, and its free Fantasy Football League has emerged as the most popular by far, ESPN spokesman Paul Melvin said. \"Part of that is because of the frequency of the games - it takes much less time to work on your roster and pick your players when you have a week between games to do it,\" he said. ESPN does not release statistics on the number of players who participate, but Melvin said estimates for the entire industry peg the number at 16 million to 20 million. Fantasy football players generate four times as many Web page views as other ESPN.com viewers and watch about three times as much football on TV, Melvin said. More than 3 million users play Yahoo! Sports fantasy football, each spending an average 90 minutes a month on the site, a Yahoo! spokesman said. As well as basic free games, Yahoo Inc. also offers premium fantasy games for $24.95 per team and $124.95 for a league of up to 20 teams. SoapNet will offer no real prizes or money for its league, but its designers think winning the title of \"Queen of the Fantasy Soap League\" will be enough for hard-core soap fans. \"We find that women just want a shout-out,\" Salmon said.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street resumes its inflation watch next week with key gauges on producer and consumer prices set for release. \\n\\n Stock investors also may start making a holiday checklist next week when U.S. retailers will round out the third-quarter earnings season as they report results and discuss the outlook for Christmas sales. With congressional elections out of the way, analysts say there is reason to be optimistic about the coming holiday shopping season. \"The fall in gas prices has psychologically been better for people and the unemployment rate is very low, so there are people out there who can spend,\" said Scott Vergin, portfolio manager at Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis. \"Plus, with Rumsfeld out, there\\'s hope things will change for the better with the war and that may help sentiment during the Christmas season,\" he added, referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld\\'s resignation on Wednesday, a day after the Democrats\\' big election victory. Rumsfeld said he quit because the political climate changed after the Democrats\\' win, which was driven by anger over the Iraq war. The Democratic sweep of Congress in Tuesday\\'s midterm elections prompted some investors to worry that it would bring about a wave of legislation unfriendly to various business sectors. Still, stocks achieved their best weekly performance in a month. \"A tone will come out of Washington of cooperation or friction. In some parts, friction and gridlock is favorable to the markets -- don\\'t make any new laws and let\\'s have a stable environment,\" said Robert Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts. On Friday, stocks ended the week higher. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  finished the week up 1.02 percent at 12,108.43, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.22 percent for the week to close on Friday at 1,380.90. The Nasdaq gave its best performance in two months, with a weekly gain of 2.53 percent. It ended Friday at 2,389.72. Fred Dickson, director of retail research at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon, said he believes the October readings on the U.S. Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index will be fairly benign. \"I don\\'t think we\\'ll get any big surprises in inflation,\" Dickson said. \"We\\'ll probably continue in a trading range environment, with the Dow holding in the 12,000 level, maybe even a little higher.\" PPI, FED MINUTES AND CPI Next week\\'s economic calendar heats up on Tuesday, with the Labor Department\\'s October report on the Producer Price Index. That will be followed on Wednesday with the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s most recent policy meeting on October 24-October 25, when it held its benchmark fed funds rate steady at 5.25 percent for the third consecutive time. And on Thursday, the Labor Department will release the October Consumer Price Index. Brett Gallagher, deputy chief investment officer with Julius Baer in New York, said, \"The rally since the summer has been built on the change in perception that the Fed may not have to continue raising rates, and in fact after a period of pause, (it) may be getting ready to lower rates. \"That drove the market and that can only happen if inflation remains in check, so I think the inflation numbers are the biggest factor,\" Gallagher said. Economists polled by Reuters expect the overall PPI to decline 0.5 percent in October, after a drop of 1.3 percent in September. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the forecast calls for core PPI to rise 0.1 percent in October, following a 0.6 percent gain in September. \"Due to the fact oil and gasoline prices have come down, we\\'ll probably see the headline numbers on both PPI and CPI come down,\" said Dickson of D.A. Davidson & Co. \"The core CPI number will be up in the 0.2 (percent) or 0.3 (percent) range, flat versus a month ago, and equity investors will look at that and see inflation on a moderating course and earnings will drive the market.\" Overall October CPI is forecast to drop 0.3 percent, following September\\'s 0.5 percent decline, according to the Reuters poll. Core CPI is pegged at an October gain of 0.2 percent, matching September\\'s rise of 0.2 percent. U.S. crude oil for December delivery CLZ6 settled on Friday at $59.59 a barrel, down $1.57 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. For the week, NYMEX December crude was up only 45 cents. Since peaking at $78.40 a barrel in July, the leading NYMEX crude futures price has fallen 24 percent.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. chocolate lovers in growing numbers are discovering how to pander to their addiction and simultaneously help the environment by buying organically certified chocolate. \\n\\n With $70 million in annual sales, organic chocolate is a tiny part of the estimated $6 billion U.S. market, but like organic coffee, it\\'s rapidly becoming mainstream, said Chris Samuel, spokesman for Green & Black\\'s USA Inc., at the 9th Annual New York Chocolate Show on Friday. Organic chocolate industry revenue is growing by 40 percent a year, with Green & Black\\'s controlling about 20 percent of the U.S. market, Samuel said. \"Taste is what started it but the press on health benefits has stimulated more interest in the natural organic market,\" Samuel said. \"Now there is an explosion of interest.\" Large and small chocolate companies are following the organic wave. A unit of Hershey Co. ( HSY.N ), maker of Hershey\\'s Kisses and Reese\\'s peanut butter cups, purchased Oregon-based Dagoba Organic Chocolate in October. Hershey\\'s move followed the acquisition by British-based Cadbury Schweppes CBRY.L of Green & Black\\'s in May 2005. Jeff Shepherd, chocolatier and owner of Oregon-based Lillie Belle Farms, started offering organic chocolate, some flavored with berries, four years ago. Selling from the trunk of his car he made $500 his first year. He has since opened a small factory that generated gross revenues of $400,000 in 2006, and he estimates he will do $1 million in 2007. \"People are starting to pay attention to what they put into their bodies,\" Shepherd said. \"And they also look at the little organic treats they put into their bodies.\" While most consumers focus on taste and health, manufacturers also point out the environmental benefits. Made from cocoa grown in sustainable rain forests, free of herbicides and pesticides, and purchased from farmers who receive guaranteed prices under fair trade agreements, organic chocolate helps protect the environment, proponents say. Organic chocolate costs more. A one-and-a-half-ounce (43 g) bar of Shepherd\\'s chocolate is about $2.50 compared with less than $1 for a regular chocolate bar from a corner store or vending machine. Shepherd is undergoing the organic certification process and will spend an initial $7,000 for approval and then annual fees.',\n",

The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 5.13 points, or 0.04 percent, to finish Friday at 12,108.43, after shifting to a slight gain for the day in the session\\'s final minutes. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  added 2.57 points, or 0.19 percent, to end at 1,380.90. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 13.71 points, or 0.58 percent, to close at 2,389.72. For the week, the Nasdaq rose 2.53 percent. The Dow advanced 1.02 percent for the week and the S&P 500 gained 1.22 percent. \"Tech stocks have been looked at as the next area of opportunity for the market. It\\'s clearly about the earnings profile at the major companies,\" said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer for Ryan, Beck & Co., brokerage and research firm in Yardley, Pennsylvania. Cisco\\'s stock rose 0.1 percent, or 3 cents, to end Friday\\'s session at $26.74 on Nasdaq -- a modest gain coming a day after its 9 percent run-up on Thursday to $27.44, its highest level since January 2004. U.S. crude for December delivery CLc1 dropped $1.57 to settle at $59.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the International Energy Agency cut its outlook for 2006 global oil demand. Caterpillar was up 0.7 percent, or 40 cents, at $59.60, while Exxon Mobil was down 0.3 percent, or 19 cents, at $74.42 on the New York Stock Exchange. \"If the stock market doesn\\'t rally on good news such as a price decline in oil, then that suggests some underlying weakness that\\'s likely to continue next week,\" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany, New York. The biggest boost to both the blue-chip Dow and the broad S&P 500 came from American International Group Inc, whose shares rose 2.3 percent, or $1.59, to $69.63, a day after the world\\'s largest insurer by market value said quarterly profit more than doubled. AIG said its results benefited from an absence of major hurricanes hitting the United States this year. But shares of Disney dropped 3.5 percent, or $1.18, to $32.40 on the NYSE, dragging on both the Dow and the S&P 500. Disney, the No. 2 U.S. entertainment company and a Dow component, posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit late on Thursday. But investors were concerned about sustainability of earnings growth in the months ahead. \"Disney is selling off because people are afraid it\\'s going to be hard to do an encore,\" said Jim Awad, chairman of Awad Asset Management in New York. Drug and health-care stocks like Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) extended a three-day decline as some investors believe a newly Democrat-controlled Congress may move to curb drug prices. Pfizer shares slipped 0.5 percent, or 13 cents, to $25.71 in Big Board trading. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.43 billion shares changing hands, below last year\\'s daily average of 1.61 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 1.74 billion shares traded, below last year\\'s daily average of 1.80 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of 2 to 1 on the NYSE and by about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.',\n",
       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - After a busy first year spent buying Pixar Animation Studios and slashing costs, Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) Chief Executive Bob Iger is under pressure to produce a strong second act to keep profit growth in double-digits. \\n\\n Quarterly results on Thursday pleased the Wall Street crowd, and Disney reiterated a double-digit earnings growth forecast for the fiscal year that opened in October. But investors sold off the stock on Friday on worries about whether Disney\\'s performance will continue to justify a stock price that hit a five-year high the previous day. \"Disney is selling off because people are afraid it\\'s going to be hard to do an encore,\" said Jim Awad, chairman of Awad Asset Management in New York. A number of analysts said on Friday, however, that they expect Disney to maintain the strong growth, given its holiday DVD releases, the next \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film in the summer and strength at the parks and television units. Iger took over last October from Michael Eisner, who after early success left with a mixed legacy from 21 years as CEO. Prudential Equity analyst Katherine Styponias wrote that she still saw Disney as the \"best strategically and financially managed company in our entertainment coverage universe.\" She wrote in a note that she saw a greater chance of Disney exceeding Wall Street\\'s fiscal 2007 targets than missing them. Analysts also forecast increases in advertising revenue in 2007 at Disney\\'s top-rated ABC TV network and its ESPN sports cable network, which lately has enjoyed record ratings for its Monday Night Football franchise. Lower pension costs coupled with higher ticket prices and per-capita spending at Disney\\'s theme parks could offset difficult comparisons with last year\\'s record attendance from Disneyland\\'s 50th Anniversary celebration promotions. \"Performance of Disney\\'s U.S. theme parks is the biggest concern,\" Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"Given strong booking trends in (the first quarter of 2007) and continued high occupancy rates, we do not expect a deterioration in the coming year.\" The company on Thursday reported flat advance bookings at domestic parks for the current quarter versus last year\\'s record-setting holiday attendance. Sanders Morris Harris analyst David Miller had warned clients in a note that the market might \"penalize\" Disney on Friday since investors were used to seeing annual growth in advance bookings in the \"high-single digits\". Analysts were counting on Disney\\'s summer movies, including Disney-Pixar\\'s \"Ratatouille\" and a third \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" as well as DVD sales for \"Cars\" and the second \"Pirates\". Lower overhead and marketing costs from staff and film output cuts would further strengthen the studio division. Miller reiterated a \"hold\" rating on Disney shares and raised his fiscal 2007 earnings forecast, but said the stock was not as \"blatantly attractive\" as it was earlier this year. Disney stock is now up 35 percent this year, and trades at nearly 20 times estimated fiscal 2007 earnings, roughly in line with rivals News Corp. NWSa.N, and Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ). Reif Cohen, who has a \"buy\" rating on Disney, said in her note that she anticipated \"continued operating momentum and an attractive long-term growth profile will drive the stock.\" Disney shares fell 3.5 percent to $32.40 on Friday.

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - British cable operator NTL Inc NTLI.O is expected to bid mostly in cash for rival broadcaster ITV ( ITV.L ), a source familiar with the matter said on Saturday. \\n\\n The companies are due to meet in coming days, with NTL outlining more details of its 5 billion pound ($9.6 billion) plus offer , the source said. It is likely to discuss tabling a bid that would value ITV at between 110 and 130 pence per share, at a premium to ITV\\'s share price, as well as an equity alternative to limit the increase in NTL\\'s debt burden, the source said. However, it was too early for a definitive detailed proposal and the terms were still being decided and might change. ITV\\'s share price stood at 105-1/2 pence before news of the approach leaked out and ended at 111p on Friday, valuing ITV at around 4.3 billion pounds, excluding almost 1 billion of debt. The Financial Times said that while NTL\\'s valuation of NTL was unclear, analysts said it would be aware of a 130p a share private equity approach in March and of a 20 percent slide in analysts\\' 2007 earnings forecasts since then. A spokeswoman for ITV said the group could not add anything further to Thursday\\'s statement when it confirmed that it had received a \"highly tentative expression of interest in holding discussions about a possible combination of NTL with ITV\". NTL declined to comment. The Daily Telegraph said on Saturday that NTL\\'s approach was understood to have put a 115p to 120p a share price tag on ITV, adding that senior management from both companies were expected to have their first meeting this weekend. The Times reported at least one private equity firm, CVC, was evaluating whether it would make a move on ITV.',\n",
       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - Alstom ( ALSO.PA ) has withdrawn its legal challenge to a major Paris suburban train contract after Canadian rival Bombardier doubled the French engineering group\\'s share of the $3.4 billion deal, Alstom said in a statement. \\n\\n Alstom will now take around a third of the work, up from the 15 percent it was initially to have been awarded by Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ), according to the statement released late on Friday. Last month, Bombardier won a contract to supply the French state-owned railways SNCF with an initial 172 trains valued at $1.7 billion, and another 200 trains to be delivered later for a total value of $3.4 billion. Alstom sought an injunction against the deal in the Paris Administrative Court on October 30, questioning whether the tender had been conducted according to the rules. The court had been due to rule on the case on November 20. \"Negotiations took place between Bombardier and Alstom to determine the modalities of the cooperation for this project,\" Alstom\\'s statement said. \"Alstom has decided to withdraw its injunction request after Bombardier gave undertakings on the terms of this cooperation. \"The share to be carried out by Alstom is estimated at one third of the overall contract, and will be carried out with a reasonable margin,\" it added. Alstom said it had taken the decision to avoid delaying renewal of Paris region rolling stock. The new trains are due to begin running in 2009, and before 2015 they will have replaced more than 20 percent of the current regional network trains. Alstom has regained financial health after a controversial state-backed bail-out in 2004, and in April construction to telecoms group Bouygues ( BOUY.PA ) agreed to buy the state\\'s stake and now holds 24 percent of Alstom.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street resumes its inflation watch this week with the latest figures on producer and consumer prices set for release. \\n\\n Stock investors also may start making a holiday checklist this week when some major U.S. retailers will report quarterly results and discuss the outlook for Christmas sales. With congressional elections out of the way, analysts say there is reason to be optimistic about the coming holiday shopping season. \"The fall in gas prices has psychologically been better for people and the unemployment rate is very low, so there are people out there who can spend,\" said Scott Vergin, portfolio manager at Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis. \"Plus, with Rumsfeld out, there\\'s hope things will change for the better with the war and that may help sentiment during the Christmas season,\" he added, referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld\\'s resignation last Wednesday, a day after the Democrats\\' big election victory. Rumsfeld said he quit because the political climate changed after the Democrats\\' win, which was driven by anger over the Iraq war. The Democratic sweep of Congress in Tuesday\\'s midterm elections had prompted some investors to worry that it would bring about a wave of legislation unfriendly to various business sectors. Still, stocks achieved their best weekly performance in a month. \"A tone will come out of Washington of cooperation or friction. In some parts, friction and gridlock are favorable to the markets -- \\'don\\'t make any new laws and let\\'s have a stable environment,\\'\" said Robert Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts. For the past week, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 1.02 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 1.22 percent. The Nasdaq gave its best performance in two months, with a weekly gain of 2.53 percent. Fred Dickson, director of retail research at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon, said he believes the October readings on the U.S. Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index will be fairly benign. \"I don\\'t think we\\'ll get any big surprises in inflation,\" Dickson said. \"We\\'ll probably continue in a trading range environment, with the Dow holding in the 12,000 level, maybe even a little higher.\" For the year, the Dow is up 13 percent, while the S&P 500 is up 10.6 percent, and the Nasdaq is up 8.4 percent. PPI, FED MINUTES AND CPI This week\\'s economic calendar heats up on Tuesday, with the Labor Department\\'s October report on the Producer Price Index. That will be followed on Wednesday with the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s most recent policy meeting on October 24-25, when it held its benchmark fed funds rate steady at 5.25 percent for the third consecutive time. And on Thursday, the Labor Department will release the October Consumer Price Index. Brett Gallagher, deputy chief investment officer with Julius Baer in New York, said, \"The rally since the summer has been built on the change in perception that the Fed may not have to continue raising rates, and in fact after a period of pause, (it) may be getting ready to lower rates. \"That drove the market and that can only happen if inflation remains in check, so I think the inflation numbers are the biggest factor,\" Gallagher said. Economists polled by Reuters expect the overall PPI to fall 0.5 percent in October. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the forecast calls for core PPI to rise 0.1 percent in October. \"Due to the fact oil and gasoline prices have come down, we\\'ll probably see the headline numbers on both PPI and CPI come down,\" Dickson of D.A. Davidson & Co. said. \"The core CPI number will be up in the 0.2 (percent) or 0.3 (percent) range, flat versus a month ago, and equity investors will look at that and see inflation on a moderating course, and earnings will drive the market.\" Overall October CPI is forecast to drop 0.3 percent, while core PPI is projected to gain 0.2 percent in October. U.S. crude oil for December delivery CLZ6 settled on Friday at $59.59 a barrel, down $1.57 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Charity Red is the new black this holiday season, but for many companies even a high level of global altruism may not be enough to push their own finances any further into the black. \\n\\n A number of big companies have joined the Red initiative by donating some proceeds from selected products to help The Global Fund to Fight AIDS in Africa. Gap and Motorola, for example, have seen plenty of demand for feel-good \"Red\" T-shirts and cell phones, though they still may not see much impact on their bottom lines. That could change, analysts say, if retailers are able to sustain the buzz around the charitable gift items and stores attract more traffic to boost the sales of non-Red products. Apparel company Gap Inc.\\'s ( GPS.N ) T-shirt carrying the message \"Inspi(red)\" has sold out online and in many stores, while Apple Computer Inc.\\'s ( AAPL.O ) original Red iPod Nano music player was so popular the electronics company issued a new model. Motorola Inc.\\'s MOT.N red RAZR cellular phone, first available only in Chicago, sold at 20 times the average rate of other RAZR phones. Red products are sold by companies in partnership with The Global Fund\\'s push to raise funds for AIDS counseling, education, anti-retroviral treatment and health centers. Sales in the 2-1/2 week period ended October 31 raised enough cash to provide 10,000 people with a year\\'s worth of a particular HIV treatment, the program\\'s press office said. Demand for the products, which also include a special line of Converse shoes, has exceeded expectations. But, since the product runs are relatively small and make up only a small portion of the company\\'s overall offerings, sales likely are not enough to add much to the companies\\' top or bottom lines, said analysts and investors. Gap said its store traffic rose in the first week after product launch, but a spokesman told Reuters in an interview that the line was too small to have a material impact. Motorola, Converse and Apple did not respond to calls for comment on sales results or forecasts. \"For Gap, it moved the needle some but didn\\'t raise overall sales,\" said Howard Hansen, a fund manager for Lord Abbett. \"For the bigger guys like Apple and Motorola, I would guess similar results.\" But, \"if you orchestrate a campaign well, and this one was very well orchestrated, it can build the brand, build the image and get incremental sales benefits,\" he said. MAINTAIN THE BUZZ Maintaining the publicity and buzz around the campaign, plus increasing product availability, could help drive holiday sales. \"If (companies) expand the product line, beyond what they\\'ve initially launched, we could see some impact,\" said Arun Daniel, consumer analyst at ING Investment Management. \"We really need to see them expand their offering.\" Gap, for one, is bringing out a Red candle for the gift-giving season and said its Red cashmere hooded sweatshirts for women are selling well. And, Emporio Armani is expected to launch a collection of jeans, shoes and other fashion items on November 16. The Web site has already registered 6,000 people who want to receive notice of product arrival, a Red spokeswoman said. \"This campaign gets a lot of people, who wouldn\\'t be shopping at these stores, to take notice,\" said Dana Telsey, a consumer analyst with Telsey Advisors. \"But you have to keep up the buzz and the products will have to be differentiated to keep up awareness. It\\'ll depend on the marketing and the products -- it needs both elements.\"',\n",
       "  ' CANBERRA  (Reuters) - The Group of 20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers will discuss ways to ensure energy and resource security in light of strong demand from China and India, Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Sunday. \\n\\n Costello will host the G-20 summit in Melbourne on November 18 and 19, with finance ministers and central bankers from the world\\'s biggest economies, including China and India, the United States, Japan and Britain. Costello said the meeting would bring major oil producing nations Saudi Arabia and Russia together with major customers, including China and India, which are experiencing growing demand for energy and resources. \"How does the world satisfy those economies that there will be continuity of supply at realistic prices, with no need to lock up supplies, without cartel activity which would rig those international markets?\" Costello told Australian television. \"If we can get an agreement on adequate supply, adequate security, proper international pricing, then I think we can actually ensure that what could otherwise become jostling and instability over resources over the next couple of decades will be taken out of the system.\" The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics predicts continued strong demand for oil in China, with crude oil consumption forecast to increase 6.5 percent in 2006 and to rise a further 5.5 percent in 2007. Resources demand from India has also increased due to strong economic growth, forecast at 8 percent in the financial year to the end of March 2007 after hitting 8.4 percent in 2005/06. Melbourne, Australia\\'s second largest city, will be under tight security for the two-day G-20 meeting, and organizers hope to head off any disruption caused by protesters. But Costello said he could not understand why anyone would protest against the G-20 meeting, which was a summit which included representatives from developed and developing nations. \"If you are concerned about aid, and poverty, and the developing world, this is a summit you should be protesting for,\" Costello said.',\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Most patients with implantable heart defibrillators are buried with the devices still inside them, stymieing efforts by doctors and companies to retrieve and check the devices for evidence of malfunction, researchers said on Sunday. \\n\\n Implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or ICDs, are stopwatch-sized devices that detect and deliver a shock to the heart to correct dangerous rhythms. High-profile recalls of defective devices have raised awareness of ICD safety, but researchers said they do not know the true rate of malfunction because the devices are not routinely checked after death. \"Implantable pacemakers and defibrillators are rarely analyzed or returned to the manufacturer after a patient dies,\" said Dr. James Kirkpatrick of the University of Pennsylvania, who presented his study results at the American Heart Association meeting in Chicago. Kirkpatrick said most devices now are buried with patients. Of those that are removed, 44 percent are disposed of as medical waste, while 22 percent are donated for animal use or for human use in developing nations. The survey found that most of the 100 morticians surveyed (87 percent) would be willing to return the devices to manufacturers for analysis. Of the 160 ICD patients questioned, 82 percent said they would give their consent. Recalls of defective devices have depressed ICD sales and dampened profits of device makers St. Jude Medical Inc., Boston Scientific Corp. and Medtronic Inc. In August, JP Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein said the ICD market has fallen 12 percent in the United States and about 6.5 percent globally on weak demand for the devices. The Heart Failure Society issued guidelines last month calling for the devices to be returned for analysis. All three companies said they would comply. Kirkpatrick advocated the use of \"Device Living Wills,\" in which patients would specify the destiny of their devices after death, as a means of helping to overcome barriers to routine device removal and analysis. \"Perhaps that would shed light on recalls and safety,\" he said.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Less than a year after private equity funds bought Hertz Global Holdings Inc. ( HTZ.N ), the world\\'s largest car rental company is on track for one of the largest U.S. stock flotations of the year. \\n\\n Private equity investors, whose appetite for acquisitions is fueling a surge in overall M&A activity, have been shortening the time between leveraged buyouts and the initial public offerings they often use to cash out on the deals. Companies are also boosting offering sizes after paying themselves larger dividends and loading up with debt. \"When you have so much money in these deals, it increases the pressure to an enormous degree to get liquidity,\" said Tom Taulli, founder of InvestorOffering.com. \"Investors are pushing for faster turnarounds and the deals are becoming flips as opposed to investments.\" ML Global Private Equity Fund LP, an affiliate of Merrill Lynch MER.N, and buyout firms Carlyle Group and Clayton Dubilier & Rice bought Hertz from Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) last December for $5.6 billion, or $15 billion including debt. Park Ridge, New Jersey-based Hertz, which also has one of the largest equipment rental businesses in the United States, is scheduled to float about 88 million shares on Wednesday, or about 27.5 percent of the company, according to a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. COULD BE NO. 2 U.S. IPO The company could raise more than $1.8 billion if the shares price at the top of a $16 to $18 forecast range and over-allotment options are exercised. The company would also be valued at about $5.8 billion. At an $18 share price, Hertz would be the No. 2 U.S. IPO this year after the $2.6 billion float of credit card association MasterCard ( MA.N ). At that price, Hertz would trade at 57 times annualized earnings, based on current earnings, which are depressed by debt service payments, according to Francis Gaskins president of IPO Desktop, a research firm based in Marina del Rey, California. Actual earnings would be higher once the IPO proceeds are used to pay down debt, making for a smaller price-earnings ratio. Still, Hertz\\'s valuation looks lofty compared with rivals Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. DTG.N and Avis Budget Group, Inc. CAR.N, which trade at about 17 and 16 times earnings respectively, according to Reuters Estimates. The Hertz investors are set to reap a paper gain of nearly $4 billion on $2.3 billion they invested less than a year ago. The three firms will also receive a special dividend of up to $642 million from Hertz if the deal prices at the midpoint of the range and the underwriters exercise their option to sell 13 million additional shares. In June, the investors used a $1 billion loan and cash on hand to pay a $999.2 million dividend to current stockholders. MIXED RESULTS Private equity-backed IPOs have turned in mixed results this year. Burger King Holdings Inc. BKC.N, which private equity bought in 2002 for about $1.5 billion, went public in May. After a slight initial gain from a $17 offering price, shares slid as low as $12.41 in August. Shares have since rebounded and closed Friday at $17.84. A consortium of investors won a heated auction for drug maker Warner Chilcott Holdings Company Ltd. WCRX.O in 2004 with a $3 billion bid. In September, the company priced shares at $15, below the forecast range and ended its first day on the market flat. Share prices have fallen since, closing Friday at $13. Some private equity backed deals have done better. Newspaper publisher GateHouse Media Inc. GHS.N, rose as much 20 percent in its market debut in October after an $18-a-share pricing and closed Friday at $21.09. Taulli said the Hertz IPO could not be better timed, with a bustling IPO market, but it pushes the envelope in terms of size and the short time between the buyout and the IPO. \"But if the IPO goes off very well, it makes it easier to get other private equity mega-deals done,\" he said.',\n",

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. retailers will likely report modest sales growth this holiday season, with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. expected to be the top shopping destination, a survey conducted for Reuters this week shows. \\n\\n The first in a series of holiday shopping polls by America\\'s Research Group found that a surprisingly large 89 percent of respondents planned to shop at Wal-Mart this year, suggesting that the retailer\\'s aggressive price cuts will succeed in luring more customers. Based on a random survey of 1,000 adults, conducted Wednesday through Friday, America\\'s Research Group projected that holiday sales at stores open at least a year -- a key retail measure known as same-store sales -- would be up about 3.1 percent, roughly the same as last year. Reuters journalists will be tracking the survey responses throughout the holiday shopping season, which typically generates about one-fourth of retailers\\' annual sales. The next survey will examine shopping patterns on the Friday after Thanksgiving, also known as \"Black Friday,\" the traditional start to the holiday shopping season. Wal-Mart, the world\\'s biggest retailer, has announced markdowns on key toys, electronics and small appliances in recent weeks as it tries to reinvigorate sales growth following back-to-back months of disappointing results. Britt Beemer, head of America\\'s Research Group, said he was \"a little flabbergasted\" by the high number of people who said they planned to shop at Wal-Mart. He had expected a figure closer to 70 percent, which is about how many have said they shopped Wal-Mart for holiday gifts in prior years\\' surveys. Of those who planned to avoid Wal-Mart this year, most said it was because they disliked the crowds. Less than 1 percent cited Wal-Mart\\'s reputation, which has been hurt by increasingly vocal critics of its pay and benefits. The survey also found that some 72 percent planned to shop for electronics at Wal-Mart now that the retailer is carrying more recognized brands such as Panasonic televisions. \"As they\\'ve added more name brands, it gives them more credibility for electronics,\" Beemer said. GETTING THE MESSAGE Shoppers are paying especially close attention to advertising this year, and nearly 95 percent said they would buy a big-ticket item on the day after Thanksgiving if it were advertised as part of \"early bird\" specials, when stores give bigger discounts to shoppers who arrive early. That was twice as many as in last year\\'s survey. With customers listening more closely to advertising, retailers need to watch what they say. Some 53 percent of those polled said they were bothered by stores shunning \"Merry Christmas\" for the more generic \"Happy Holidays.\" Wal-Mart, which faced sharp criticism in recent years for switching to \"Happy Holidays,\" announced last week that it would bring Christmas signs back to its stores, and encourage greeters to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Retailers also need to be sure that they have the staff to handle the crowds. The survey found that 64 percent of shoppers will avoid stores that are short-handed, up from 51 percent in last year\\'s poll.

Volvo has said that the North American heavy-duty truck market could contract by as much as 40 percent during the first half of next year. \"It is completely an adjustment to the expected volume declines due to the pre-buy effect in connection to the new emission rules,\" Volvo spokesman Marten Wikforss told Reuters. The staff cuts at the plant, where the firm assembles trucks of the Volvo and Mack brands, will begin in January next year and be completed during the first quarter. Volvo has already said it will cut 600 jobs at its subsidiary Mack Truck\\'s plant in Hagerstown, Maryland, during the first six months of 2007. Wikforss repeated an earlier estimate that the total costs for the firm\\'s cut-backs in the United States will weigh on fourth-quarter earnings to the tune of 100 million Swedish crowns ($14.13 million).',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The resignation of KB Home\\'s ( KBH.N ) long-time chief over backdated stock options grants is focusing renewed attention on the big riches that home-building executives reaped in recent years. \\n\\n Few people have ridden the housing wave as successfully as former KB Home CEO Bruce Karatz and other heads of publicly traded home builders, whose business exploded from late 2003 until the end of 2005 as consumers armed with low mortgages rushed to buy homes in hot markets. Since then, however, the sizzling housing market has slowed and home-building stocks have fallen. Karatz took in nearly $45.6 million in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2005, including base pay, bonus, restricted stock and stock option grants, up about 29 percent from $35.3 million in 2004, according to data compiled by Salary.com, a compensation specialist. KB Home\\'s stock rose 39 percent in 2005, but shares are now down by about that same percentage so far this year as the housing market has cooled. Much of Karatz\\'s 2005 earnings came from $27.9 million in restricted stock, almost double what he got a year earlier. Karatz agreed on Sunday to repay the Los Angeles-based company, the fifth-largest U.S. home builder, about $13 million in gains he received from mispriced stock options. But the two sides still must hash out other exit terms, including what happens to his millions of dollars worth of outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock awards. The past few years have been particularly lucrative for heads of home-building companies, with compensation packages often tied to rising profit at their businesses. In announcing Karatz\\'s departure, KB Home noted that the company\\'s total annual revenue had soared to more than $9.4 billion in 2005, up from $1.4 billion a decade earlier. But critics of lofty executive compensation say the big paydays for home-builder chiefs in recent years were mostly a result of economic factors such as affordable mortgages that created the sizzling housing market -- not because of who was at the helm of these companies. \"The housing industry was the beneficiary of low interest rates, so they were the beneficiary of that,\" Arthur Kroll, chief executive of executive compensation specialist KST Consulting, said of CEOs in the home-building sector. Last year, Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ) boss Robert Toll took in $37.9 million in base pay, bonuses, stock option grants and restricted stock, according to the Salary.com data. Much of that was from his bonus, which totaled $27.3 million. Other pay awards to home-building chiefs last year included $32.8 million to Lennar Corp.

Hitachi President Kazuo Furukawa told reporters the company aimed to win contracts to build at least a third of the 25 nuclear power plants the U.S. Department of Energy aims to have built by 2020. Hitachi, which had sales of 160 billion yen ($1.4 billion) from its nuclear power business in Japan last year, will transfer its 2,000-person nuclear power division to a joint venture in Japan.

GE will not create similar joint ventures with Toshiba, but Toshiba will continue to be a supplier, Villa said. Hitachi\\'s deal with GE, to be signed by June 2007, comes as market watchers worry about Hitachi\\'s ability to secure overseas contracts, after its faulty turbines caused nuclear power units to close down at Japanese utilities Chubu Electric Power Co. and Hokuriku Electric Power Co. in the summer. Hitachi expects a group net loss of 55 billion yen for the year to March, after factoring in an expected cost of 38 billion yen fix the turbines, plus cost overruns at its U.S. thermal power plants. Nuclear power has come back into favor on concerns about crude oil price rises among fuel-hungry countries such as the United States and China.

       "  ' MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russia\\'s Energy Ministry has rejected a plan to expand the capacity of a Chevron-led oil pipeline from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea, Kommersant business daily said on Monday. \\n\\n The paper said shareholders in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) had proposed adding $2.5 to the current pipeline transit fee of $27.38 per tonne of oil to get Russia\\'s agreement on a long-awaited expansion of the link. The consortium wants to almost double capacity from 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.3 million bpd, but has faced opposition from Russia, which fears the pipeline -- the only private crude oil link on its territory -- could increase tanker traffic at the already congested Bosphorus straits in Turkey. Russia complains that low transit fees are delaying repayment of $5.3 billion in loans which CPC raised from its private shareholders. That in turn delays the moment when Russia starts receiving its profits as a shareholder. But raising transit fees could also make the pipeline a less attractive option for oil exporters, which would give Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft a greater say in the growing Caspian export market. The paper quoted sources close to Russia\\'s state property agency as saying the Energy Ministry wanted the fee to be raised by nearly 40 percent. It quoted a letter from Energy Minister Viktor Khristenko to Chevron as saying that Russia was going to stick to its tough position toward the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC). An Energy Ministry spokesman could not confirm the information. Chevron\\'s Moscow office said the company had not received the letter officially, although it was aware that it was being prepared. \"Chevron is currently working very actively with all CPC shareholders on agreeing the basis for CPC expansion,\" a spokeswoman said. \"The work is going well and we expect it to conclude in the near future,\" she added. Analysts say Russia\\'s tough line on CPC -- the venture has also received back-tax claims -- is part of a broader Kremlin strategy to limit foreign involvement in the strategic energy sector. Russia has slapped the group with a 4.7 billion rouble ($176.6 million) back-tax claim for 2002-2003 and is currently checking its accounts for 2004-2005. CPC handles most of the oil exports from Kazakh oil fields to Novorossiisk, Russia\\'s largest Black Sea port, for re-export to world markets. Chevron is a 15 percent shareholder in CPC while Russia is a 24 percent shareholder in the consortium. Shareholders also include Kazakhstan and Oman as state shareholders as well as oil companies BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell, LUKOIL and Rosneft.',\n",

Citigroup and France\\'s Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) have been locked in a takeover battle for more than a year, with the sources saying both sides are bidding about $3 billion for 85 percent of GDB. China, which is set to open its banking sector fully to foreign competition under WTO obligations next month, has attracted nearly $21 billion in financial services industry investments since 2001, according to Boston Consulting Group. IBM would join a consortium that the sources said included top life insurer China Life Insurance Co. ( LFC.N ) ( 2628.HK ) \"It is IBM\\'s practice not to comment on rumors or speculation,\" an IBM spokesman said in an email, while officials at Citigroup and GDB declined to comment.

If successful, Citigroup and Associates First would take a combined stake between 20 and 21 percent -- above the 20 percent limit imposed on individual foreign stakes in Chinese banks -- in an arrangement that has won Beijing\\'s blessing, the banker said. A final agreement between the consortium members is expected to be signed this week, the banker said. Citigroup, Associates First and IBM are seeking a combined holding below the 25 percent limit on total foreign ownership in a Chinese bank.

GDB is a top client for IBM, which supplies more than 80 percent of the bank\\'s IT systems and devices, a technology industry source said on Monday. Citigroup last year won preliminary approval to take a stake larger than 20 percent in GDB, but that arrangement was later knocked down by regulators, re-opening the bidding with SocGen. \"Everyone would have liked to go down the route Citigroup was planning if they could. Any foreign bank going into China would like to have management control,\" said Peter Tebbutt, a senior director in the Asia Pacific financial institutions group of Fitch Ratings. \"Chinese banks generally need a lot of work in systems and commercial orientation and culture, and you need to have control to make those changes,\" he said.

       "  ' BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - MasterCard ( MA.N ) faces EU antitrust scrutiny this week over fees it charges shops to accept its credit and debit cards as part of a 1.3 trillion euro ($1.67 trillion) annual turnover. \\n\\n The European Commission alleges the company restricted competition by setting minimum prices retailers must pay, and will open two days of closed hearings starting on Tuesday. The Commission is considering abolishing controversial and complex interbank fees charged by MasterCard, which can differ card by card. The probe is part of a larger look at the payment industry by the European Union\\'s executive body and comes as EU Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy said he and his competition counterpart might team up to take tough, sector-wide action. McCreevy said he would not hesitate to get involved if he found evidence of abuse. (for story, click on nL13885456) Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said this year the area needed review because practices in the credit card industry pushed up payment card costs for consumers and businesses. MasterCard associate general counsel Carl Munson, in Brussels for the hearings, declined to discuss the case directly because of restrictions he said were imposed by the Commission. But he said the company\\'s business practices were helpful to everyone involved. \"We would argue that in the long run this is a benefit not just to cardholders but to merchants,\" he said. But Cecile Gregoire, an economist for EuroCommerce, a trade group of merchants, wholesalers and traders, argued that MasterCard used its power to charge high rates. And she said because most merchants did not impose surcharges for using credit cards, customers who paid cash subsidized the fees that merchants must pay banks. \"The (fees) act like a tax on transactions, increasing the prices of all goods, even for consumers who do not pay with credit cards,\" she said. \"Why should the merchant pay for this service?\" she asked. Munson argued that merchants had a choice. \"Cash is an alternative. Cheques are an alternative. The truth of the matter is that there are an awful lot of merchants that don\\'t take debit cards,\" he said in a telephone interview. Replied Gregoire: \"Commercially, most retailers cannot afford not to accept cards.\" In a public statement, the Commission said 85 percent of all merchants in the 28-country European Economic Area accepted the cards. MasterCard had 45 percent of the cards, sharing the market with Visa. A second issue is the requirement that all cards be honored. Gregoire said merchants could not tell the costs of each card, with some cards costing more than others. Nothing pops up to warn a merchant of higher fees on some cards than others, she said. Munson said merchants could telephone to find the costs of particular cards, but acknowledged there was no monthly accounting of the cost of each transaction each month. Gregoire also said MasterCard had hiked the costs of debit cards when it took over such an operation in Britain. She said that when MasterCard\\'s Maestro took over the Switch system there, \"there was a 60 percent increase in cost overnight\". Munson said he lacked specific knowledge of those costs, but that the costs per transaction were usually only pennies. The overall 23 billion card payments made in the EU in 2004 added up to 1.35 trillion euros, the Commission said. ($1=.7775 euro)',\n",

Some Swiss and German banks adopted IFRS earlier and did not have to make the charge. Khamoo said the corridor accounting method should be scrapped. \"We would encourage full disclosure,\" he said. Banks also had to come up with a funding plan for their pension liabilities. \"This is something they have to face up to. These are very large amounts and they have to fund liabilities with related assets,\" said Khamoo. Since the transition to IFRS, a further 4 billion euros in costs had been charged directly to shareholders\\' equity and \"9 billion euros has not been accounted for at all by banks that adopted the corridor method at January 1, 2004.\" When banks transferred to IFRS in January 2004, they set their books to zero, charging past actuarial losses to their accounts. \"But in less than two years they have developed 9 billion euros of further actuarial losses. That\\'s a hug sum of money for a short period of time,\" said Khamoo. The report said the risk arising from defined-benefit pension obligations amounted to an additional visible risk to many financial institutions \"along with the more traditional banking factors of credit and market risk.\" Lloyds Bank ( LLOY.L ) had the highest pension obligations as a percentage of shareholders\\' equity at more than 160 percent at the end of 2005. Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ) had the lowest, at around 20 percent. The overall net deficit for the banks in the survey rose by 16.7 percent over 2005. The corridor method was adopted by 35 of the 44 European banks in the survey and the banks that did not adopt it were mostly based in Britain and Ireland. United States accounting requirements are more onerous regarding pensions liabilities. \"The FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) came up with new standards which are effective for U.S. public companies from December 2006 and they have to record the whole funded status into the balance sheet,\" said Khamoo.',\n",

Tyson is the nation\\'s No. 1 producer of beef and chicken and No. 2 producer of pork. An excess of meat and higher prices for feed and fuel have hurt Tyson and other producers. To restore profits, Tyson this year initiated a $200 million cost-cutting plan, closed meat plants, and cut chicken production. \"We think the worst is behind the industry. Given that we believe the time to buy commodity stocks is when earnings have troughed and have begun to improve, we think now is the time to buy Tyson,\" Diane Geissler, Merrill Lynch food analyst, said in a research report. Tyson reported a loss of $56 million, or 17 cents a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with a year-earlier profit of $117 million, or 33 cents per share. It took charges totaling $43 million, or 10 cents per share, relating to cost cutting, plant closings, and to tax and accounting issues. Excluding charges, the loss would have been 7 cents per share. On that basis, analysts\\' average forecast was for a loss of 4 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Tyson itself had predicted it would break even or post a loss up to 10 cents per share. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $6.471 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates but down from $6.495 billion a year earlier. The company posted a loss of $196 million, or 58 cents per share, for the year ended September 30. In the last three quarters it has posted losses of $235 million. But Tyson forecast a profit of 50 to 80 cents per share for the current year due in part to cost-saving measures. \"We set a short-term goal to return to profitability, and based on our business performance to date, I am very confident we will achieve it in the first fiscal quarter of 2007,\" said Bond. Tyson shares were up 60 cents or 4.2 percent at $14.95 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Not all analysts were positive. Pablo Zuanic at J.P. Morgan said improvement in the beef and chicken segments may be slower than Tyson expects. \"We rate Tyson neutral and do not agree with the almost substantial jump in the share price today. We believe fiscal year 2007 guidance assumes meaningful year over year improvements in chicken and beef economics, which we do not share,\" Zuanic said in a research report. The company does not provide quarterly forecasts but in a conference call with Wall Street analysts predicted a \"very strong\" second half of the year. The excess of chicken forced U.S. producers to cut production, and Tyson said it had cut output about 5 percent and that would not be added back in 2007. Tyson raises its own chickens for its poultry plants but buys cattle and hogs for its beef and pork operations, and higher corn prices have affected results. Corn prices reached a 10-year high at the Chicago Board of Trade in early November, largely due to increased demand from the growing ethanol industry, and that has increased meat production costs. \"Higher grain costs are going to raise the cost of protein for the consumer -- this will also be true for beef and pork as well,\" said Bond. Meat analysts have said the latest oversupply of meat has been due to greater production. The U.S. Agriculture Department projects U.S. beef production in 2006 to rise 5.2 percent, pork to rise 2 percent and chicken to rise 1.4 percent.',\n",

Mapping the first draft of the archetypal human genome, the \"book of life\" that includes all the genes in the human body, took 10 years and cost $1 billion. It was finally completed to much fanfare in 2000. Solexa\\'s stockholders will receive shares of Illumina valued at $14 per Solexa share. Solexa shares closed at $9.70 on Friday on the Nasdaq, resulting in a 44 percent premium for the deal. In addition, Illumina has agreed to invest $50 million in Solexa in exchange for newly issued Solexa shares. Shares of Illumina fell 8.3 percent to $40.38 in morning trade on the Nasdaq, while Solexa surged 32.7 percent to $12.87. The two firms said the combined group would have a market opportunity of at least $2.25 billion and would be the only business with genome-scale technology for genotyping, gene expression and sequencing -- three key modern analytical tools. Solexa expects its first-generation instrument will enable human genome resequencing for less than $100,000 a sample, and the longer-term goal is to reduce this to a few thousand dollars, making it suitable for both basic research and clinical diagnostics. The companies said they expected the deal to close by the end of the first quarter and to add to earnings modestly in 2008 and significantly thereafter.

       "  ' SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ) is pushing ahead with plans to add more drive-thru restaurants to its KFC business in China, but is taking a more cautious approach than rival McDonald\\'s Corp. ( MCD.N ), the top executive for that market said on Monday. \\n\\n The fast-food company plans to open 100 KFC drive-thrus in China over the next three years, Yum China President Sam Su said, calling that plan very aggressive. The company currently has four drive-thrus in China. Su added, however, that he did not see the need for half of KFCs new outlets to have drive-thrus. McDonald\\'s has said that at least 50 percent of its new restaurants in China would be drive-thrus as it looks to cash in on a rapid rise in car ownership in the world\\'s most populous country. \"I\\'m not sure I share completely that sentiment,\" Su said in an interview. \"The car has become almost a home away from home for Americans. That\\'s not necessarily the same in China.\" McDonald\\'s is the world\\'s largest restaurant company by sales, but has a much smaller presence in China than KFC. Yum operates more than 1,700 KFC restaurants in China and opens a new one every day on average. McDonald\\'s has about 770 restaurants in China and plans to open about 100 a year. Car ownership is growing rapidly in China due to a booming economy that has increased consumers\\' ability to make big-ticket purchases. Car sales rose 27 percent in 2005 and could climb an additional 29 percent this year, according to trade magazine Automotive News. That kind of growth, along with strong performances at its existing drive-thrus, prompted McDonald\\'s earlier this year to sign a deal with China oil giant Sinopec ( 0386.HK ) to jointly develop drive-thrus at some of the gas station operator\\'s 30,000 locations in China. McDonald\\'s now has six drive-thrus there. Su said KFC had made similar agreements with other retailers in China and would talk about those deals once the drive-thrus are up and running. Approaching Chinese retailers and landlords about building drive-thrus is a challenge because many are not yet familiar with the concept, he said. Nevertheless, drive-thru is one of several ways KFC is looking to expand its fast-growing business in China. Other opportunities include opening locations in airports and expanding its breakfast menu, Su said. Breakfast, he said, makes up a small portion of KFC\\'s overall sales, but is a growing opportunity as Chinese consumers become more strapped for time. \"More and more people for breakfast don\\'t want to cook anymore and just want to grab something and go,\" he said. \"The opportunity is very very good,\" he said. KFC\\'s breakfast menu has Western-style products like a sausage-and-egg sandwich, but also has traditional Chinese items such as congee, a kind of rice porridge. KFC is also looking into adding a delivery service and expanding its business hours. McDonald\\'s has said its growing number of 24-hour stores in China had helped boost sales in that market this year. But Su said KFC was \"not jumping into 24 hours. We don\\'t see enough evidence that there is big demand for it.\" Still, the more different KFC and McDonald\\'s are, the better for both companies, Su said. McDonald\\'s, for instance, has been aggressively marketing its primary beef menu in China, while KFC is centered around chicken.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices fell $1 to below $59 on Monday as mild weather in the United States kept a lid on heating demand and dealers continued to doubt OPEC\\'s ability to deliver on its agreed crude production cut. \\n\\n \"There are growing concerns about the lack of OPEC compliance,\" said Bill O\\'Grady, analyst at A.G. Edwards. \"If OPEC isn\\'t cutting back as much as it says it is, it will be hard for prices to stay afloat.\" U.S. crude CLc1 settled down $1.01 to $58.58 after falling as low as $58.25, while London Brent crude LCOc1 fell 66 cents to $59.05. Top world exporter Saudi Arabia is planning to enforce its OPEC oil cut in full until the end of the year, sources said Monday, but analysts expected that some other OPEC members would not adhere to their output limits. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last month to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day from November 1. But the U.S. government said last week it was expecting OPEC to fall well short of that cut, reducing output by only 745,000 bpd this month as Iran and Venezuela keep their production steady. Adding to pressure, U.S. heating demand was expected to be about 16 percent below normal this week, the second straight week of below normal weather-related energy demand, according to the National Weather Service. \"We\\'re treading water ahead of the winter,\" said Jason Schenker, an economist at Wachovia Bank. \"Inventories look good, and it is pretty warm.\" Oil prices are 25 percent below their peak hit in July. Oil markets took a hit late last week after the International Energy Agency reported a large increase in inventories in the biggest consuming nations, and forecast reduced demand for OPEC oil. The IEA, which represents the interests of consumer countries, said stockpiles in leading industrialized nations filled at a rate of 1.15 million bpd, the biggest third-quarter rise since 1991, due to a slowdown in demand growth. But it also said markets would tighten more than expected in the fourth quarter as winter demand rebounds. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday will provide the next indication of the health of U.S. stockpiles.',\n",

( GS.N ) to advise it. Sources familiar with the situation said on Sunday that bids were due on Monday and that proposals were expected from two consortia. Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone BG.UL and KKR KKR.UL make up one consortium, while the other consists of Bain Capital, Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL and Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL. Details of any bids are not likely until late on Monday or early Tuesday, sources familiar with the process said. KKR, Thomas H. Lee, Texas Pacific, Bain, Clear Channel and Goldman Sachs declined comment. Blackstone and Providence were not available for comment. Clear Channel shares fell 1.2 percent to $34.55 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. PRICE A number of analysts have share price targets for Clear Channel in the mid-$30s and upward. Deutsche Bank, in a recent note, said its target of $36 took into account the possibility that Clear Channel would eventually accept a bid to go private. Bank of America analysts last month raised their fair-value range on the shares to $34-$40 from $34-$38, saying there were multiple strategic options the group could pursue, including taking the entire company private and spinning off its outdoor unit. Clear Channel has a majority ownership in outdoor advertising group Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. ( CCO.N ). Other interested parties have also been named by media reports. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that two groups thought to be interested -- Apollo Management and Carlyle, and Cerberus Capital and Oak Hill Partners -- had largely faded out of the picture. Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, Texas, recently forecast strong fourth-quarter radio-advertising sales. It posted a 9.5 percent drop in third-quarter profit, reflecting the spinoff of its entertainment unit. Advertising-driven radio broadcasters such as Clear Channel have been challenged to develop new formats and technology in the face of growing competition from satellite radio, the Internet, and personal digital music players.

The Wall Street Journal also reported the meeting in its online edition on Sunday. The New York Times reported on Monday that Greenberg too is considering a bid for Tribune and has been reaching out to investment bankers and lawyers about pursuing an offer. Greenberg has also expressed interest in pursuing The Boston Globe, owned by the New York Times, and Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Gannett's pursuit of Tribune, publisher of USA Today, forms part of an already crowded field of suitors, which includes several groups of private equity firms. Tribune, with a market value of about $8 billion, is trying to sell itself against the background of weak financial results, an uncertain future and pressure from the Chandler family, a major shareholder. Tribune assets also include New York's Newsday and the Chicago Cubs baseball team. Since opening the bidding process, Tribune has reached out to several media groups, including Gannett, Hearst Corp. and Dean Singleton's MediaNews Group Inc., the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The company also has been in contact with News Corp., which is interested in Newsday in New York, the Journal said. MediaNews has had informal discussions with Tribune about some of its assets, such as the Hartford Courant and the Stamford Advocate in Connecticut, but hasn't had any meetings with the company, the Journal said, citing one person familiar with the matter. A Gannett spokeswoman declined to comment. Greenberg could not immediately be reached for comment. Tribune recently posted lower-than-expected third-quarter revenue, joining other newspaper publishers in reporting weak advertising sales. One preliminary offer was put in by a private equity group made up of Texas Pacific Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, one source familiar with the situation has told Reuters.

       "  ' BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - A Dutch foundation holding the shares of Dofasco, Arcelor Mittal\\'s ( ISPA.AS ) Canadian unit, said on Monday it had refused a request that would have allowed the sale of the unit to Germany\\'s Thyssenkrupp ( TKAG.DE ). \\n\\n \"We have decided not to terminate the administration of the shares of Dofasco,\" the foundation\\'s chairman Allan Tuttle told Reuters in a telephone interview. Thyssenkrupp said in a statement it was not ready to concede defeat and was determined to continue its efforts to snatch the Canadian steel maker. \"ThyssenKrupp will exhaust every possibility to bring about the sale of Dofasco to ThyssenKrupp, as bindingly agreed by Mittal Steel,\" the German company said in a statement. It added that it would build a new steel mill in the United States if the acquisition of Dofasco proved impossible. The price of the sale of Dofasco to Thyssenkrupp is C$68 per share, C$3 lower than the price paid by Arcelor to buy the Canadian group in January this year in a transaction that totaled C$5.6 billion. Arcelor acquired Dofasco prior to its struggle to fend off a hostile bid from Mittal Steel earlier this year, which ended with the friendly merger of both groups. Set up in the heat of the takeover battle, the foundation was designed to prevent Mittal Steel from selling Dofasco, which was a condition set by U.S. competition authorities to allow the merger of the two groups. \"The goal of the foundation was to prevent or make the takeover of Arcelor more difficult. It is no surprise that this now causes problems,\" said Christopher Kummer, the Director of Manda, an Austrian mergers and acquisitions institute. U.S. regulators previously said that if the sale was blocked by the foundation, Arcelor Mittal would have to sell either its Sparrows Point plant in Maryland or its Weirton, West Virginia, plant. \"Arcelor Mittal is reviewing the situation and will be in contact with the U.S. Department of Justice,\" Arcelor Mittal said in a statement on Monday. Sources close to Arcelor previously said the foundation was likely to refuse the sale of Dofasco on the grounds that the Canadian group holds key technology for Arcelor and that the price paid by Thyssenkrupp was insufficient.

The stock, which traded as high as $23.50 in December, was up 13 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $8.98 in afternoon trading. Eddie Bauer has struggled to revive a brand that traces its roots back to 1920. The company is best known for outdoor-inspired clothing and accessories, but has also licensed its name for products ranging from Ford Explorer trucks to baby strollers. The retailer operates some 375 stores, but analysts have long said that it had trouble setting itself apart from similar companies such as L.L.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. retailers will likely report modest sales growth this holiday season, with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. expected to be the top shopping destination, a survey conducted for Reuters this week shows. \\n\\n The first in a series of holiday shopping polls by America\\'s Research Group found that a surprisingly large 89 percent of respondents planned to shop at Wal-Mart this year, suggesting that the retailer\\'s aggressive price cuts will succeed in luring more customers. Based on a random survey of 1,000 adults, conducted Wednesday through Friday, America\\'s Research Group projected that holiday sales at stores open at least a year -- a key retail measure known as same-store sales -- would be up about 3.1 percent, roughly the same as last year. Reuters journalists will be tracking the survey responses throughout the holiday shopping season, which typically generates about one-fourth of retailers\\' annual sales. The next survey will examine shopping patterns on the Friday after Thanksgiving, also known as \"Black Friday,\" the traditional start to the holiday shopping season. Wal-Mart, the world\\'s biggest retailer, has announced markdowns on key toys, electronics and small appliances in recent weeks as it tries to reinvigorate sales growth following back-to-back months of disappointing results. Britt Beemer, head of America\\'s Research Group, said he was \"a little flabbergasted\" by the high number of people who said they planned to shop at Wal-Mart. He had expected a figure closer to 70 percent, which is about how many have said they shopped Wal-Mart for holiday gifts in prior years\\' surveys. Of those who planned to avoid Wal-Mart this year, most said it was because they disliked the crowds. Less than 1 percent cited Wal-Mart\\'s reputation, which has been hurt by increasingly vocal critics of its pay and benefits. The survey also found that some 72 percent planned to shop for electronics at Wal-Mart now that the retailer is carrying more recognized brands such as Panasonic televisions. \"As they\\'ve added more name brands, it gives them more credibility for electronics,\" Beemer said. GETTING THE MESSAGE Shoppers are paying especially close attention to advertising this year, and nearly 95 percent said they would buy a big-ticket item on the day after Thanksgiving if it were advertised as part of \"early bird\" specials, when stores give bigger discounts to shoppers who arrive early. That was twice as many as in last year\\'s survey. With customers listening more closely to advertising, retailers need to watch what they say. Some 53 percent of those polled said they were bothered by stores shunning \"Merry Christmas\" for the more generic \"Happy Holidays.\" Wal-Mart, which faced sharp criticism in recent years for switching to \"Happy Holidays,\" announced last week that it would bring Christmas signs back to its stores, and encourage greeters to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Retailers also need to be sure that they have the staff to handle the crowds. The survey found that 64 percent of shoppers will avoid stores that are short-handed, up from 51 percent in last year\\'s poll. Some 28.1 percent of consumers planned to entertain more at home this year, and spending on Christmas decorations was expected to rise, according to the survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percent.',\n",
       "  ' SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) forecast \"very strong\" demand for computer memory chips for the first quarter of 2007, thanks to the much-awaited January launch of Microsoft\\'s new Vista operating system. \\n\\n Chu Woo-Sik, senior vice president of investor relations, said Samsung would sell more mobile phones in January-March than in the current quarter, and its LCD business was performing better than expected in the current quarter. The world\\'s top memory chip maker and biggest maker of large liquid crystal displays (LCD) so far this year also said it was considering an additional eighth-generation LCD line. \"Our DRAM (dynamic random access memory) orders for Q1 are very strong, considering the seasonality aspect. We have most of the orders for Q1 as PC OEMs (original equipment makers) are ordering to be Vista-ready,\" Chu told the Samsung Tech Forum 2006 in Singapore. Samsung, the world\\'s third-largest handset maker after Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and Motorola MOT.N, sold a record 30.7 million phones in the July-September third quarter and has said it expects to beat that in the fourth quarter. For 2007, Chu said the company expected to beat global handset sales growth, which it projected at 10 percent. But he said fourth-quarter handset profit margins would fall from the third quarter due to marketing costs. Samsung\\'s handset division had an 11 percent profit margin in the third quarter versus 9.5 percent in the second quarter. \"Samsung traditionally suffers from high marketing costs in the fourth quarter as they clear out inventory. Profit margin in handsets should come in at 10 percent in the fourth quarter and 11 percent in the first (quarter of 2007),\" said An Sung-ho, analyst at Hannuri Securities in Seoul. Samsung\\'s mobile business is recovering from a difficult first half -- during which it was hurt by the runaway success of Motorola\\'s clamshell RAZR phone -- with the success of a new series of ultra-sleek phones launched over the summer. Song Myung-sup, analyst at CJ Investment & Securities, said he expected Samsung to sell just over 31 million phones in the fourth quarter and 33 million in the first quarter of 2007. Samsung shares rose 1.6 percent on Monday in a flat market  .KS11  as its comments fueled optimism on sector earnings. Chu said half the demand for Samsung\\'s handsets would come from emerging markets next year. \"We see a big surge from Eastern Europe and India,\" he added. NAND \"NOT BAD\" He said demand and prices for DRAM chips, used mostly in personal computers, were strong in the fourth quarter and saw the market for NAND flash memory chips, popular in digital cameras, stabilizing as well. \"Overall demand is expected to be pretty strong for NAND flash next year,\" Chu said, adding that demand would be supported by new applications such as music cellphones, car navigation systems and portable media players. Chip and PC makers have been eagerly awaiting the release of Microsoft\\'s ( MSFT.O ) Vista operating system as consumers have been delaying the purchase of new PCs for the same reason. \"For a while, there were oversupply fears about DRAM for the first half of 2007, but it seems manufacturers are fairly confident demand will remain sufficient,\" said CJ\\'s Song. In DRAM, Samsung competes with Germany\\'s Qimonda QI1Ay.DE QI.N and South Korea\\'s Hynix Semiconductor ( 000660.KS ), while in NAND, it competes with Japan\\'s Toshiba ( 6502.T ) and Hynix. LCD SHORTAGE POSSIBLE On LCDs, Chu said the fourth quarter was shaping up to be better than anticipated, thanks to cost cuts and a recovery on the monitor display side. \"In the second half of 2007, there could be a shortage of LCD panels on the TV side,\" as the LCD industry delays fresh investment in the wake of price falls, Chu said. Jun H. Souk, executive vice president of LCD R&D center, told reporters Samsung was mulling an additional 8G LCD line but had not decided whether it would be built with Japan\\'s Sony ( 6758.T ). A Sony spokeswoman declined comment on the matter. The 8G line will use bigger glass panels, enabling makers to produce more LCD panels and boost efficiency. Eighth-generation mother-glass substrates yield eight 46-inch TV panels or six 52-inch panels, versus six 46-inch panels from 7th-generation glass. David Steel, vice president of marketing at Samsung\\'s digital media division, told reporters he expected global sales for LCD TVs to rise to 66 million units in 2007 from an estimated 42 million this year, while plasma display TVs would increase to 13 million from 10 million.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  Nov 14 (Reuters) -  Cheaper energy helped push\\nU.S. producer prices down steeply during October but also\\ncontributed to a decline in retail sales, according to\\ngovernment reports on Tuesday showing a modest softening in\\neconomic activity last month. \\n\\n  The Labor Department\\'s Producer Price Index (PPI) that\\nmeasures prices at the factory and farm level dropped 1.6\\npercent, matching a record fall in October 2001 and was three\\ntimes the decline Wall Street analysts had predicted.  Core producer prices that exclude food and energy fell 0.9\\npercent, the biggest decline since a 1.2 percent fall in August\\n1993.   \"These numbers are the latest indication that the U.S.\\neconomy is slowing and that inflation is in fact,\\ndecelerating,\" said Mark Meadows, a currency strategist with\\nTempus Consulting in Washington.  Bond prices rose on the signs of reduced inflationary\\npressures in the PPI report while stocks opened higher as some\\nkey retailers reported higher earnings that bolstered hopes for\\nthe holiday spending outlook.  Prices in futures markets showed investors still believe\\nU.S. Federal Reserve policy-makers will keep rates steady at\\ntheir final policy session for this year in December. But\\nchances for a cut in January rose to 6 percent from zero and\\nprospects for a March cut rose to 30 percent from 22 percent\\nlate on Monday.  Falling new-car and truck prices also were a significant\\nfactor pushing down producer prices. Light-truck prices dropped\\na record 9.7 percent in October after rising 3.5 percent in\\nSeptember while passenger car prices fell 2.3 percent after a\\n2.8 percent gain in September.  Department officials said that excluding car and truck\\nprices, October core producer prices were up a slight 0.1\\npercent.  RETAIL SALES  The Commerce Department said overall retail sales fell 0.2\\npercent in October on top of a 0.8 percent drop in September.  Last month\\'s drop was not as steep as the 0.4 percent\\ndecline analysts had predicted, primarily because new-car sales\\nthat account for a significant part of monthly sales climbed\\n0.6 percent following a revised 0.7 percent gain in September.  The Commerce Department said that if sales of new cars and\\nparts were stripped out, October retail sales fell 0.4 percent\\n-- somewhat steeper than the 0.2 percent analysts had\\nforecast.  But analysts said it did not appear that consumers were\\nthrowing in the towel on spending and said that was an\\nencouraging sign.  \"In general, when we\\'re looking at the macro picture, you\\nwant to know how is the consumer doing, and excluding gasoline\\npurchases, it\\'s a fairly good number,\" said Richard Sichel,\\nchief investment officer with Philadelphia Trust.  A separate and more current survey of U.S. chain-store\\nsales, the Johnson Redbook Index, showed sales in the week\\nended Nov. 11 rose 3.3 percent on a year-over-year basis. That\\nwas just slightly below the prior week\\'s 3.4 percent rise.  A similar survey by the International Council of Shopping\\nCenters and UBS Securities found chain store sales rose 2.1\\npercent in the Nov. 11 week year-on-year.  The Labor department said energy prices fell 5 percent in\\nOctober on top of September\\'s 8.4 percent decline. Natural gas\\nprices for home heating were down a record 9.3 percent last\\nmonth.  The department said prices for light trucks plunged a\\nrecord 9.7 percent in October after rising 3.5 percent in\\nSeptember. It was the largest fall since records were started\\nin 1964. Passenger car prices were down 2.3 percent last month\\nfollowing a 2.8 percent gain in September.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' HANOI  (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific business leaders called on Tuesday for an Asia-Pacific free trade area to counter the proliferation of mini-pacts that are adding costs and complexity to doing business in the region. \\n\\n The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) also urged leaders of the 21 Pacific rim economies meeting in Hanoi to take stronger steps to curb trade in pirated goods and develop better plans to deal with pandemics such as bird flu. At their annual meeting ahead of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit this weekend, the business council noted that bilateral and regional trade pacts have blossomed in recent years, while a vast APEC-wide zone had yet to get off the drawing board. \"ABAC strongly urges leaders to develop an APEC initiative to promote convergence and consolidation among existing agreements, and those currently being negotiated,\" the group said in a report prepared for the leaders\\' summit. At least 50 free trade pacts have been agreed or are under discussion among countries represented at APEC, experts say. APEC says its 21 members account for nearly half of global trade, 40 percent of the world\\'s population and 56 percent of the world\\'s gross domestic product. REVIVE DOHA ROUND If not dormant, progress toward APEC\\'s dream FTA has been glacial, as encapsulated by the title of the declaration for this year\\'s meeting: \"The Hanoi Plan of Action on the Pusan Roadmap toward the Bogor goals\". Last year\\'s APEC meeting was in Pusan, South Korea and an Asia-Pacific free trade area was first envisioned at the 1994 meeting in Bogor, Indonesia. Nevertheless, a top U.S. trade official said the so-called Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific is \"an interesting idea\" that merits serious discussions in Hanoi. And while it remains too early to say what will come out of this week\\'s talks, the United States wants a strong APEC statement to \"help reinvigorate the Doha round,\" Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Karan Bhatia told Reuters in Washington. Some trade experts believe APEC leaders could give a much-needed jolt to the nearly dead Doha round of world trade talks by promoting a regional free trade zone. That could also help businesses facing a growing web of smaller pacts in the region, often with conflicting rules. \"FTAs offer opportunities to liberalize trade, but there are concerns about spaghetti bowl issues of compatability and the costs when you have lots of agreements to keep track of,\" APEC official Scott Smith told Reuters on the sidelines of the business leaders\\' meeting. ABAC, comprising three top business people from each APEC economy, also urged leaders to renew efforts to revive the Doha round of global trade talks, which collapsed in July. The global trade round was a \"once in a generation opportunity to make progress on trade liberalization and must end in a positive outcome for the world trading community\", the ABAC report said. The business leaders said that while considerable progress had been made in intellectual property protection, \"traffic in counterfeit products continues to grow faster than the trade in legitimate products\". The council saw a \"critical need for more information about avian influenza\", to help the Asia-Pacific business community \"prepare continuity plans for the possibility of a future health pandemic\". Vietnam\\'s President Nguyen Minh Triet told the opening session of ABAC that Asia-Pacific economies had achieved above average growth rates despite an unstable oil market. \"That shows the liberalization of trade and investment is indeed stimulation for promoting development and bringing in prosperity for the entire APEC region in general, and each economy in particular.\"',\n",
       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) on Tuesday narrowed its third-quarter loss and restated financial results from the last five years to correctly account for interest rate derivatives used to hedge longer-term debt. \\n\\n The restated results are for 2001-2005, the company said in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For the third quarter of 2006, the company reported a net loss of $5.25 billion, an improvement of about $550 million from the preliminary results released on October 23. For the first nine months of 2006, Ford recorded an improvement of $250 million, reducing its loss to $7 billion. \"The headline number is a positive, but if you look at recent years, they were not as good as originally reported,\" Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan said. \"I think that is an indication that this is a company that is still facing a lot of challenges.\" Ford will be filing amended 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of 2006 on or by November 20, Ford spokeswoman Becky Sanch said, adding the company\\'s cash position was not affected. The restatements added, in total, about $850 million to net income through the third quarter of 2006, she said. Tynan said the numbers show that Ford\\'s initial turnaround plan, announced in 2002, did not have the traction that was originally reported. \"It\\'s a company that is struggling and those numbers indicate it,\" he said. Ford Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair told analysts and reporters that the automaker should be profitable in its North American unit in 2009, but cost-reduction efforts would continue beyond that year. \"That is a way of life for us,\" he said, referring to cost cuts. Leclair also said the company has made certain assumptions on the 2007 labor negotiations with the United Auto Workers union while compiling its outlook, but he declined to give details. CHANGES FROM 2001 TO 2005 The accounting changes that triggered the restatements involved the use of derivatives by Ford\\'s finance arm. Ford said the restatements bring its financial reporting up to date with the SEC. The company said it also identified adjustments that should have been recorded in periods earlier than 2001 but decided these to be immaterial to the originally filed financial statements, and recognized the adjustments as \"out-of-period.\" In the restatement, Ford narrowed its 2001 net loss to $4.8 billion from a previously reported loss of $5.45 billion. For 2002, it reported a profit of $900 million instead of a loss of $1 billion. Net income for 2003, 2004 and 2005 was reduced by $300 million, $500 million and $600 million, respectively, Ford said. The restated net income for 2003, 2004 and 2005 were $200 million, $3 billion and $1.4 billion. Last month, Ford reported a $5.8 billion third-quarter preliminary net loss -- its biggest in 14 years -- and predicted fourth-quarter operating losses and significant cash drain in the \"near to medium term.\" The company said it was exploring various financing strategies, including secured financing involving a substantial portion of its automotive operations to raise cash. Leclair said the company is close to arranging a secured financing deal, but declined to reveal the value of the deal. Ford shares were down 11 cents, or 1.24 percent, at $8.76 in noon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Jui Chakravorty )',\n",

Volkswagen last week appointed Winterkorn, the head of the Audi ( NSUG.DE ) premium division, as new CEO, replacing Bernd Pischetsrieder, who will resign at the end of the year. The paper said Volkswagen's supervisory board would like to keep Bernhard but that relations between him and Winterkorn were cool. The firm declined to comment on the report. Chosen by Pischetsrieder to head the VW brand, Bernhard has been at the forefront of VW's campaign to slash costs and jobs at the group's troubled western German operations. Bernhard is responsible for delivering 7 billion euros ($9 billion) in gross earnings improvements at the VW brand by 2008, and has aggressively looked to prune benefits and extend working hours for the roughly 100,000 workers at the six traditional VW plants in western Germany.\",\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. government sued former Cendant Corp. CD.N Vice Chairman Kirk Shelton and several members of his family on Tuesday for nearly $40 million in fraudulently transferred assets. \\n\\n Shelton was convicted of fraud in January 2005 and sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in a decade-long accounting scheme that inflated earnings and stock values of Cendant, a real estate and travel company, and its predecessor CUC International. Former Cendant Chairman Walter Forbes was convicted last month for the scheme that -- when revealed in 1998 -- wiped $14 billion off Cendant\\'s market value. It was one of a series of accounting scandals that shook the U.S. corporate world. Shelton was also ordered to pay nearly $3.3 billion in restitution, but he is currently free on bail as he appeals his conviction and sentence. Forbes is due to be sentenced in January. U.S. Attorney Christopher Christie, the chief federal prosecutor in New Jersey, said in a statement on Tuesday that authorities were determined to recover all the money stolen from shareholders. \"The charges filed today describe a series of transactions through which Shelton established straw companies and transferred more than $22 million in personal assets to those companies within days of learning Cendant would be pursuing him for the billions of dollars of damages,\" Christie said. He also accused Shelton of transferring more than $5.5 million to his wife and other close family members.

       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan\\'s economy grew faster than expected in the July-September quarter, data showed on Tuesday, boosting bond yields on expectations that the Bank of Japan is on track to raise interest rates by early next year. \\n\\n The stock market benchmark rose more than 1.5 percent as the growth data cheered traders who were worried about a slowdown, but the government remained cautious on the economic outlook, pointing to sluggish consumption. Cabinet ministers also said they wanted the BOJ to support the economy through monetary policy -- a stance they have stated often in the past. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy, rose 0.5 percent in the three months to September, government data showed, beating market expectations of a 0.2 percent rise. On an annualized basis, the economy grew 2.0 percent in July-September, double the pace the market was expecting. It was the seventh straight quarter of expansion and also exceeded the 1.6 percent growth in the United States in the same quarter. \"The data showed the economy continued to expand, moving toward steady growth, although the growth seemed to be led by foreign demand,\" said Yasuhiro Onakado, chief economist at Daiwa SB Investments. \"The chance of a rate increase by the BOJ in January or February is large unless we get surprisingly poor data in production,\" he said. BOJ RATE HIKE The data surprised financial markets, which had feared the data could show a contraction in the economy. The Nikkei share average  .N225  rose 1.67 percent, its biggest one-day gain in six weeks, while the yen rose to around 117.40 yen  JPY=  per dollar from 118.05. Japanese bond yields soared, with the two-year yield briefly rising 9.5 basis points to a three-month high of 0.825 percent JP2YTN=JBTC, as investors grew nervous about the possibility the BOJ could raise rates as early as December. The central bank has said it will raise interest rates gradually in the future after hiking them in July for the first time in six years to 0.25 percent from zero. While the BOJ is expected to keep rates on hold at its policy meeting later this week, many investors think the bank could bump rates up in December or January. \"I think the chances of a rate hike in December are getting high,\" said Kikuko Takeda, a market economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. \"Not only that, markets may start to think that the BOJ may raise rates once more after that next year.\" WEAK CONSUMPTION But Economics Minister Hiroko Ota said she wanted the BOJ to support the economy through monetary policy, echoing similar comments from Finance Minister Koji Omi. Some economists also said the GDP data may not be as strong as it first appears, because growth was propelled solely by exports and capital spending while domestic consumption was weak. Private consumption, which accounts for some 55 percent of Japan\\'s GDP, declined 0.7 percent in the July-September quarter. Making up for the slump in consumption, capital expenditures grew 2.9 percent, well above the market consensus for a 0.7 percent rise. Exports grew 2.7 percent on the back of strong overseas demand, helped in part by a cheaper yen. Economics Minister Ota also raised the alarm about consumption, saying its sluggishness may not be due entirely to technical, one-off factors, such as bad weather in July. \"The lack of rises in wages might be behind this,\" she said. \"I\\'m watching consumption with concern. I don\\'t think the economy will fall into a recession. But we need to be cautious over consumption and also on a possible inventory adjustment in the IT-related sector.\" At the moment, most economists do not see a sharp inventory adjustment in the high-tech sector. \"There will be an inventory adjustment near the year-end, but there won\\'t be a sharp drop in production,\" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research. Tsunoda said sales of computers are likely to rise early next year after the release of Windows Vista, Microsoft\\'s upgraded operating system, on January 30. Elsewhere, the GDP deflator -- a measure used to derive real GDP from nominal GDP by adjusting for price changes, fell 0.8 percent in July-September from the same quarter a year earlier.

       "  ' SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Canadian oil firm InterOil Corp. IOL.TO said on Tuesday a gas and condensate discovery in Papua New Guinea could hold at least 4 trillion cubic feet of gas, potentially the biggest discovery in the Pacific nation. \\n\\n Chief Executive Phil Mulacek told Reuters the Elk-1 field, would be developed for a US$3 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) joint venture between InterOil, Merrill Lynch Commodities (Europe) Ltd. and private equity group Clarion Finanz AG. \"Third parties have said that the flow of the Elk-1 well is bigger than anything they have seen in North West Shelf,\" Mulacek said in a phone interview. \"The indicative tests show that it field has at least 4 trillion cubic feet of gas and could underpin an LNG development.\" \"So far, all tests results show that this could potentially be the biggest discovery in the history of Papua New Guinea,\" he said. While analysts in Canada said the discovery is promising, it is too soon to say if the Elk-1 find would be similar in size to recent discoveries such as Woodside Petroleum\\'s Ltd. WPT.AX Pluto field in Australia, which has 4.1 trillion cubic feet of gas. Papua New Guinea\\'s proven gas reserves are over 15 trillion cubic feet. \"The (reserve) thickness is very, very encouraging, the pressure is abnormally high, and probably double what you would expect for a discovery this deep,\" said Rob Moss, oil and gas analyst at Acumen Capital Partners in Calgary. \"To suggest there could be several trillion cubic feet, given the information currently available, is perhaps a little opportunistic,\" Moss said. SHARES SOAR News of the find sent InterOil\\'s shares soaring on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock hit an intraday high of C$28.99 and closed 23.6 percent higher at C$27.93. The stock has advanced nearly 60 percent over the past six months. \"You can make projections and show possibilities, but I think it\\'s way too early to quantify what kind of find is in the ground,\" said Ira Zadikow, analyst at Great Eastern Securities. \"It definitely increases the assets of InterOil, but if they don\\'t have a way of distributing it, or transporting it, or marketing it -- it doesn\\'t do a thing for its revenues.\" Mulacek said the company will drill more wells on the Elk field and at nearby prospects to determine the size of the discovery. The final results of the appraisal are expected to be released in the first half of 2007 and first deliveries are scheduled for early 2012, InterOil said. A company drilling update on Monday said preliminary tests showed the field recording a gas flow of 21.7 million standard cubic feet per day at a flowing bottom hole pressure of 3,590 psi. The hole is 1,624 meters deep. Mulacek added that preliminary tests indicate that there could also be a layer of oil under the gas and condensates. Marketing of the LNG will be mainly handled by Merrill Lynch, which is supplying gas to customers in the United States, where it has access to pipelines and a LNG import terminal in Louisiana. The LNG project will also be targeting customers in Australia and North Asia, he said. InterOil, Merrill Lynch and Clarion Finanz each have about 30 percent stake in the joint venture. InterOil is expected to report its third-quarter earnings results after the Canadian market closes on Tuesday. ($1=1.139 Canadian Dollar) (Additional reporting by  Jonathan Spicer  in Canada)',\n",

It also paid restricted stock units, options and a warrant that can be converted into 442,210 shares of Google\\'s common stock. The $1.65 billion stock deal included around $15 million in funding which Google provided to YouTube between signing the deal in early October and closing the deal this month. One-eighth of the equity, or roughly $200 million, will be held in escrow as security on certain unspecified indemnification obligations, the Google statement said. YouTube has enjoyed explosive growth over the past year and in the process, pioneered a new grassroots online video star-making system, as Web viewers seek out short-form comic sketches created by other users. San Bruno, California-based YouTube says it serves up more than 100 million videos a day. But its popularity has also been fueled by the widespread availability of copyrighted TV episodes and music videos for which media companies say they should be compensated. Media industry sources in recent weeks have said that some portion of the price paid by Google would be reserved to settle potential copyright infringement suits aimed at YouTube. Meanwhile, Google and YouTube have said they are racing to strike deals with video producers that would allow them to share in revenue when such programming appears on YouTube. YouTube Co-founder and Chief Executive Chad Hurley said that Google\\'s backing will provide his company with the flexibility to continue to offer innovative services, but also emphasized that the company would remain independent. \"In the coming months, we will roll out many new exciting features and programs,\" Hurley said. \"The community will remain the most important part of YouTube and we are staying on the same course we set out on nearly one year ago.\" Speaking at a Stanford University conference on Saturday, Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt was asked whether the YouTube deal was evidence of a new stock market bubble comparable to the late 1990s dot-com era.

       "  ' SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Sitting on worn plastic chairs in a downtown Shanghai brokerage hall, more than a hundred people in their 50s and 60s trade rumors, stare at electronic boards displaying prices, or just get on with their knitting. \\n\\n \"I like to come here every day. I regard this as my new office,\" said Madame Zhou, who retired two years ago and has recently put 20,000 yuan ($2,545) in the stock market, roughly the annual disposable income of an average Shanghai resident. Zhou, who knits when no fast-rising stock takes her fancy, is part of a major shift in China\\'s financial world -- the return of individual investors to the equity market. After deserting the market during a four-year slump that halved the benchmark Shanghai index  .SSEC , ordinary Chinese -- from retirees to office and factory workers, small businessmen and students -- are once again putting their savings into stocks. They are being lured by a strong market rally, aggressive advertising by an expanding fund management industry, and the government\\'s decision in May to encourage China\\'s top firms to list domestically instead of focusing on foreign bourses. Creating an \"equity culture\" in China has become an important part of economic policy. Officials publicly tout the market\\'s prospects and praise reforms to boost corporate transparency and cut the influence of parasitic state shareholders on companies. More money in stocks helps wean firms off excessive reliance on bank loans, reducing risk in the financial sector. It is also helping to deflate a speculative property bubble in some cities such as Shanghai, as funds flow from real estate to equities. \"People of my generation believe Chairman Mao\\'s saying: listen to the Party. So I think now is a good time to buy,\" said Lao Zhu, who trades in a plush VIP room reserved for wealthy individual investors at Guotai Junan Securities. Zhu started investing in stocks several months ago, selling a house that he had been renting out and plowing 1 million yuan ($125,000) of the proceeds into equities. \"I believe the government aims to help the stock market again, in the same way as it boosted the property market several years ago,\" he said. More than 2 million investors, almost all individuals, joined the equity market in the five months through the end of September, bringing the total to 76 million, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said. In the previous five-month period, the number of investors dropped by 861,800. October money supply data released on Monday showed individual savings deposits at banks fell by 7.6 billion yuan from the previous month. It was the first drop since June 2001, and analysts believe a major reason was that people were taking money out of banks to invest in stocks. A key event that boosted individuals\\' confidence was the smooth listing in Shanghai late last month of the country\\'s biggest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ( 601398.SS )( 1398.HK ), which raised over $5 billion in the domestic market\\'s largest-ever share offering. Company officials and advertising by mutual funds have successfully portrayed the domestic listings of ICBC and other blue chips as chances for ordinary Chinese to share in the profits of the country\\'s economic miracle for the first time. The flood of individual investors\\' money, combined with fresh funds from local institutions and foreigners, has helped push the Shanghai index up 60 percent so far this year. The index, which ended on Tuesday at 1,888 points, now appears within striking distance of its record high of 2,245, hit in June 2001. That is next year\\'s target for many individual investors. Analysts estimate individuals account for some 70 percent of daily turnover, which has doubled from levels early this year -- though the proportion has not grown significantly since institutions and foreign investors are also more active. Although growth in individual investment has been explosive, the experience of other countries suggests it may still have a long way to run in coming years. China\\'s 76 million stock investors in September were only about 5 percent of the population. In the United States, over 40 percent of households own shares. Some analysts believe, however, that the road to a shareholding culture may not be a smooth one. Though they agree the stock market\\'s regulatory framework is stronger and the number and quality of its blue chips greater than ever before, they note that the bull-run up to June 2001, which ended in tears after valuations rose too high, was also accompanied by government efforts to talk up the market. \"There\\'s a saying in the Chinese stock market: when even the old ladies selling newspapers outside the trading floor start to buy stocks, then it\\'s the end of the bull run,\" said Zhang Qi, analyst at Haitong Securities.',\n",
       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Nikkei climbed 1.67 percent on Tuesday, posting its biggest one-day percentage gain in six weeks, after stronger-than-expected gross domestic product data sparked a rebound in Sumitomo Realty & Development Co. Ltd. ( 8830.T ) and other firms sensitive to domestic demand. \\n\\n Machinery and bank shares were among the beneficiaries of the strong GDP while shares of Aozora Bank Ltd. ( 8304.T ), a Japanese lender floated by U.S. private equity firm Cerberus CBS.UL, slumped in their market debut, marking a sluggish start for Japan\\'s biggest IPO in eight years.  After the market closed, Tokyo Electron Ltd. ( 8035.T ) said first half profit rose 55 percent on high orders for chip and liquid crystal display-making equipment and raised its forecast for the full year.  \"Some investors had sold Japanese stocks betting that the Japanese economy was going to stall. Now these people have had to buy stocks back,\" said Tsutomu Yamada, a market analyst at Kabu.com Securities Co. \"Investors were worried too much.\" The Nikkei  .N225  rose 267.06 points to 16,289.55, while the broader TOPIX index  .TOPX  advanced 1.76 percent to 1,596.42. Japan\\'s economy expanded 0.5 percent in the three months to September compared with the preceding quarter, beating market expectations of 0.2 percent growth in price-adjusted terms. Still, some analysts agreed that the market should have been higher and investors are still not fully confident about scooping up Japanese stocks. For one thing, companies\\' full-year outlooks are very conservative, said Masayoshi Yano, a senior manager of investment information at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co. Ltd. \"Investors are hung up about the cautious outlooks provided by companies,\" he said. \"There are too many investors who cannot be bullish. That\\'s why stock prices aren\\'t going up.\" Masaki Iso, head of Japanese equities at Yasuda Asset Management Co. Ltd., agreed. \"The GDP numbers were good but the Japanese economy is slowing down,\" he said. \"It\\'s likely that we may see more signs of weakness in the third quarter. Investors were cautious.\" Trade rose from the previous session, with 1.85 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange\\'s first section. However, that was little changed from last month\\'s daily average of 1.82 billion shares. Advancing shares beat decliners by a ratio of more than seven to one. GDP EFFECT, FALLING AOZORA Sumitomo Realty & Development, Japan\\'s third-largest property firm, jumped 4.9 percent to 3,620 yen, helping the property subindex .IRLTY.T to be the best performing sector. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. ( 8316.T ) surged 4.2 percent to 1.23 million yen, after falling more than 8.5 percent over the previous five sessions. Top lender Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. ( 8306.T ) gained 2.9 percent to 1.44 million yen, snapping its seven-session losing streak. Machinery stocks also benefited from the GDP data which showed strong capital spending. Industrial robot maker Fanuc Ltd. ( 6954.T ) rose 2.7 percent to 10,640 yen. Okuma Holdings Inc ( 6103.T ), a machine tool maker, jumped 10.9 percent to 1,128 yen to become the biggest Nikkei 225 gainer. The company was also bolstered by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun which said on Tuesday the company will likely post a record profit for the year to March 2007, thanks to a weak yen and the brisk capital spending by airlines and energy companies. Shares of Aozora Bank ended their first day at 502 yen, 11.9 percent below their IPO price of 570 yen.  Market participants said Aozora\\'s $3.2 billion initial public offering was too big for the market. The size of the offering compares with a daily average turnover of 2.6 trillion yen ($22.1 billion) on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\\'s first section in October. \"In terms of valuation the stock does not look cheap ... and I think that has been the market\\'s evaluation.

Traders said a key technical breakout in the S&P 500 fueled buying momentum, while a report showing that the core U.S. Producer Price Index, stripping out food and energy costs, had its sharpest tumble in more than 13 years in October, also lent support. \"There\\'s a general sense of confidence in the economy still,\" said Steve Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Co., in Greenwich, Connecticut. \"We\\'re seeing evidence of that in the retail earnings that came out today.\" The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 86.13 points, or 0.71 percent, to end at a record 12,218.01. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index gained 8.80 points, or 0.64 percent, for a close at 1,393.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 24.28 points, or 1.01 percent, to 2,430.66. The PPI data reduced concerns about inflation and reinforced expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates steady, while some believed the weak PPI reading increased the chances of a rate cut sometime next year. VISIONS OF DISCOUNTED SUGARPLUMS Wal-Mart shares jumped nearly 3 percent, or $1.34, to $47.66 on the New York Stock Exchange, and were the Dow\\'s second-biggest advancer. In the No. 1 spot was Home Depot Inc., whose stock reversed an earlier decline to end up 4.3 percent, or $1.56, at $37.96 on the NYSE. The S&P retail index climbed 2.4 percent, its biggest one-day percentage gain in two months. \"Everybody worries about the holiday season, but then things come out better than expected. You can bet on that year after year,\" said Frank Gretz, market analyst and technician at Shields & Co., a brokerage in New York. Wal-Mart said it would further cut prices of toys and games in its fourth set of price reductions in categories including electronics, small appliances and toys. It also posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and said deep discounts would drive better holiday sales. Rival Target reported a bigger-than-expected 16 percent increase in quarterly profit and gave a confident outlook for the holiday season despite fierce competition from Wal-Mart. Target shares rose 2.4 percent to $59.16. As for Home Depot\\'s turnaround from a decline earlier in the session to a higher finish, traders said investors appeared to have long priced in the profit miss and the prospects for a bearish outlook that the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain gave before the bell. S&P 500 BREAKS ABOVE 1,390 Analysts also said a key technical breakout in the S&P 500 fueled buying momentum. \"In January 2001 and December 2000, the S&P could not get beyond 1,380. With today\\'s move through 1,380 and 1,390, you have broken that top,\" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist of Delta Global Advisors in Boston. Earlier, the Dow also hit a fresh intraday record high at 12,228.01, while the S&P 500 rose to 1,394.49, its highest since November 2000, and the Nasdaq reached 2,430.83, its highest since late February 2001. Among the Nasdaq 100\\'s biggest advancers were shares of Qualcomm Inc., up 3.8 percent, or $1.36, at $37.56, and Intel Corp., up 4.2 percent, or 88 cents, at $21.88, a day after Citigroup added Intel to its recommended list. A DANISH SUITOR FOR PIER 1? Shares of U.S. home furnishings chain Pier 1 Imports Inc. surged 20.6 percent, or $1.30, its biggest one-day jump in more than seven years, to finish at $7.62 on the NYSE after sources familiar with the matter said Danish retail magnate Jakup Jacobsen is preparing to bid for the company. The stock hit a session high at $7.78, up 21 percent, and ranked second among the NYSE\\'s biggest percentage gainers. In other economic news, Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis President William Poole said the odds of another rate hike were about the same as a rate cut, but the current posture of policy was correct. He also said home builder concessions to lure buyers may be hiding deeper price declines in U.S. housing markets. Volume was active on the NYSE, where about 1.72 billion shares changed hands, above last year\\'s daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.02 billion shares traded, exceeding last year\\'s daily average of 1.80 billion.

Investor concerns over slower growth rates even as more advertisers are spending money on the Web have weighed on Internet leaders like Yahoo Inc. and others. Internet media companies have responded by seeking higher-growth avenues on the Web, from social networking capabilities to new services created with traditional media, while still working to grow their base of marketers. \"This growth follows the trend of where consumers are spending their media time and the unique ability of interactive advertising to effectively target and monitor ad campaigns,\" said David Silverman, a partner at PwC.',\n",

A second bid, from a consortium consisting of Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL was also submitted on Monday, a separate source told Reuters. Texas Pacific Group, which had previously been involved in that consortium, was not part of the bid, the source said. Clear Channel was reviewing the bids at a board meeting on Tuesday, sources said. CNBC said earlier that an announcement could be made before the stock market opens on Wednesday, with bids at around the $36-a-share mark. That would value the company at about $18 billion. Clear Channel shares nudged 8 cents lower to $34.30 by lunchtime on the New York Stock Exchange. Clear Channel, which has about 1,150 stations, said last month that it was evaluating strategic alternatives for its business and had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) to advise it. KKR, Texas Pacific, Bain, Blackstone, Providence, Thomas H. Lee, Clear Channel and Goldman Sachs declined comment. A number of analysts have share price targets for Clear Channel in the mid-$30s and upward. Deutsche Bank, in a recent note, said its target of $36 took into account the possibility that Clear Channel would eventually accept a bid to go private. Bank of America analysts last month raised their fair-value range on the shares to $34-$40 from $34-$38, saying there were multiple strategic options the group could pursue, including taking the entire company private and spinning off its outdoor unit. Clear Channel has a majority ownership in outdoor advertising group Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. ( CCO.N ). Other interested parties have also been named by media reports. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that two groups thought to be interested -- Apollo Management and Carlyle, and Cerberus Capital and Oak Hill Partners -- had largely faded out of the picture. Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, Texas, recently forecast strong fourth-quarter radio-advertising sales. It posted a 9.5 percent drop in third-quarter profit, reflecting the spinoff of its entertainment unit. Advertising-driven radio broadcasters such as Clear Channel have been challenged to develop new formats and technology in the face of growing competition from satellite radio, the Internet, and personal digital music players.

The retailer said it expects fourth-quarter sales at stores open at least a year to be up 1 percent to 2 percent and that price cuts on items like toys and electronics were already drawing shoppers. While Wal-Mart\\'s plans could generate sharply higher traffic, other retailers\\' shares suffered on Tuesday as the prospect of having to compete against deep discounts from the leading retailer spread little cheer throughout the sector. For example, consumer electronics retailers, who stand to lose sales of hot items such as flat-panel televisions to Wal-Mart, saw their shares fall. Circuit City stock fell 4.4 percent to $23.79 on the New York Stock Exchange while shares of Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) and RadioShack Corp.

Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart\\'s chief financial officer, said consumers were still concerned about energy prices, even though gasoline costs have come down from a late-summer peak, and a sluggish housing market. \"At the end of the day, our customer is looking for value,\" he said. \"That\\'s what is going to make or break our fourth quarter.\" Joseph Beaulieu, an analyst with Morningstar, said Wal-Mart\\'s focus on cutting prices was a positive. \"Wal-Mart is ... getting back to what\\'s made them work in the past,\" he said. \"The way they\\'re toning down the talk about fashion and talking more about discounting, that\\'s the kind of thing that makes that store tick.\" He said Target, whose profit beat Wall Street estimates due to strong performances from its Target and Target Visa credit cards, was somewhat sheltered from the need to match Wal-Mart\\'s discounts because their stores cater to wealthier shoppers and are concentrated in the northern United States rather than the South. \"I think Target can do well in a quarter that Wal-Mart does well,\" he said. \"In a quarter when Wal-Mart and Target both do really well, other retailers could get hurt.\" Wal-Mart shares, which are roughly flat year-to-date, rose 96 cents to $47.28 while Target rose nearly 1 percent to $58.09.

It was Home Depot\\'s first decline in quarterly profit since the fourth quarter of 2002. Analysts, on average, expected profit of 75 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Per-share results were helped by lower shares outstanding in the latest period as Home Depot bought back stock. Total sales rose 11.3 percent to $23.1 billion, falling short of analysts\\' average estimate of $23.3 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important retail measure, fell 5.1 percent. \"Home Depot is in a very challenging position,\" Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a research note, adding that results point to lower customer traffic. Home Depot, which is competing fiercely for consumer dollars with smaller rival Lowe\\'s Cos. ( LOW.N ), said a slowing U.S. economy, declining home sales and falling home prices hurt its retail division, where total sales rose just 1.1 percent to $19.7 billion. Other key metrics weakened. The average purchase fell 1 percent to $58.33, the first decline in four years, while average weekly sales per store fell 7 percent. Home Depot cited softness in most departments and said consumers were taking on fewer costly improvements such as kitchen renovations and flooring projects. In the Home Depot Supply segment that caters to home builders and other contractors, sales more than doubled to $3.5 billion, helped by acquisitions. HOME SALES WEAKEN Atlanta-based Home Depot and Lowe\\'s have both cut their outlook this year as higher borrowing costs and weaker U.S. home sales cooled big-ticket purchases. In September, existing home sales slowed for the sixth straight month, and new home sales were off 14 percent from year-earlier levels, according to government and housing industry reports. Home Depot said per-share profit could fall as much as 16 percent in the fourth quarter. As Lowe\\'s enters big U.S. cities, Home Depot has invested in new products, technology and service to defend its market share, including plans to spend $350 million in the second half of this year to add staff and improve store appearance. \"It appears that the company is aware of its shortcomings on the retail side,\" said Peter Jankovskis, director of research at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. Home Depot pared its growth forecast, saying it now expects per-share profit to rise 4 percent to 5 percent for the current fiscal year, while sales would increase about 12 percent. The company had previously said full-year results would come in at the low end of projections of a 10 percent to 14 percent increase in per-share earnings and a 14 percent to 17 percent rise in sales. Home Depot shares eased 38 cents to $36.02 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lowe\\'s was off 2 cents at $28.98. Analyst had largely expected the weaker quarterly results.

Wal-Mart, the world\\'s biggest retailer, has cut prices on key toys, electronics and small appliances, and vowed to be \"relentless\" in holiday season discounting. Gregg Steinhafel, Target\\'s president, called Wal-Mart\\'s markdowns \"business as usual\" and said his company would respond aggressively. \"As we get deeper in the holiday season, we expect to experience more price cutting and then we will respond as quickly as we possibly can to make sure our prices are in line,\" he said on a conference call with analysts. Target earned $506 million, or 59 cents per share, in the third quarter ended on October 28, up from $435 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 55 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly revenue rose 11.2 percent to $13.57 billion, with sales at stores open at least a year -- a key retail measure known as same-store sales -- up 4.6 percent. Earlier on Tuesday, Wal-Mart posted an 11.5 percent increase in profit, with U.S. same-store sales up 1.5 percent. CREDIT CARDS Target\\'s sales growth has outpaced Wal-Mart\\'s in recent quarters, in part because Target caters to wealthier shoppers who are less sensitive to economic factors such as rising energy costs. Target said its credit card business had contributed $176 million to earnings before taxes, up 63 percent from a year earlier. The retailer issues its owns Target and Target Visa credit cards, which have been big profit drivers. Lehman Brothers analyst Robert Drbul said the credit card earnings were better than he had expected. On the conference call, Target said credit delinquencies and write-offs had increased as expected after a recent regulation that increased minimum payments, but said delinquencies were likely at or near their peak. The retailer said fourth-quarter earnings would likely be in line with Wall Street expectations for $1.26 per share, with same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits. Shares of Target were up 28 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $58.04 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Wal-Mart were up 2.3 percent to $47.40.

Net income rose to $2.65 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the third quarter that ended October 31, from $2.37 billion, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Results in the latest period include a 1-cent-per-share insurance gain related to last year\\'s hurricanes. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 60 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Wal-Mart said on October 5 that profit would probably be in the range of 59 cents to 63 cents per share. Sales rose 12 percent to $83.54 billion, with international sales up nearly 34 percent, helped by acquisitions. Wal-Mart posted lackluster sales growth at its U.S. stores open at least a year, hurt by disruptions from store remodeling efforts and a poor reception for its trendier clothing. Chief Executive Officer Lee Scott said third-quarter U.S. sales were softer than planned, but holiday season price cuts should boost fourth-quarter demand. \"This season, no one will doubt Wal-Mart\\'s leadership on price and value,\" he said. BACK TO BASICS Joseph Beaulieu, an analyst with Morningstar, said Wal-Mart\\'s refound focus on cutting prices was a positive after a year of talking about adding higher-end merchandise to get wealthier customers to buy more than just food. \"Wal-Mart is...getting back to what\\'s made them work in the past,\" he said. \"The way they\\'re toning down the talk about fashion and talking more about discounting, that\\'s the kind of thing that makes that store tick.\" The retailer forecast fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations of 88 cents to 92 cents a share. Analysts on average expected 92 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. On a recorded message detailing third-quarter results and fourth-quarter plans, Scott said specials such as a $398 laptop computer sold out quickly, and he vowed the \"most aggressive pricing strategy ever\" for the holiday season. Wal-Mart\\'s closest rival, Target Corp. ( TGT.N ), posted a strong 16 percent jump in quarterly profit on Tuesday, and called Wal-Mart\\'s cost-cutting efforts \"business as usual.\" Beaulieu said Target is somewhat sheltered from Wal-Mart\\'s aggressive holiday discounts because their stores cater to wealthier shoppers and are concentrated in the U.S. north rather than Wal-Mart\\'s power zone in the south. \"I think Target can do well in a quarter that Wal-Mart does well,\" he said. \"In a quarter when Wal-Mart and Target both do really well, other retailers could get hurt.\" Wal-Mart expects fourth-quarter sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year to be up 1 percent to 2 percent. Wal-Mart had previously forecast flat same-store sales for November, so the quarterly forecast suggests stronger growth in December and January. In the third quarter, the U.S. discount stores posted 7.8 percent total sales growth, with operating income up 9.9 percent.

       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on Tuesday it would further cut prices on toys and games in its fourth set of markdowns aimed at spurring sales growth during the crucial holiday season. \\n\\n Previously the company had reduced prices in categories including electronics and home appliances in the face of sluggish sales. Earlier in the day, the world\\'s largest retailer posted a 11.5 percent rise in net income and Chief Executive Lee Scott vowed that the company\\'s \"most aggressive pricing strategy ever\" would revive sales during the holiday. Wal-Mart shares rose as much as 4 percent to $48.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. Wal-Mart, which said the latest markdowns bring the total number of discounted toys to over 150, has been trying to reinvigorate growth after back-to-back months of disappointing sales. The company\\'s more fashionable apparel line Metro 7 has not been a hit with shoppers, while remodeling projects have disrupted hundreds of U.S. stores. The company first said in October that it would lower prices on more than 100 key toys, such as Mattel Inc.\\'s MAT.N Hot Wheels Radar Gun at $20, down from $29.74, and the Monopoly Here & Now board game from Hasbro Inc. HAS.N, which will sell for $15 instead of $28.96. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart also announced price cuts on electronics such as plasma televisions and digital cameras, appliances such as microwaves and coffee makers, and a holiday clothing collection from Metro 7. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart said in a statement that it will continue to match competitors\\' prices on toys through December 31. Newly discounted toys include the Bratz Kids doll, marked down to $8.88 from $12.94, and the Superman Inflato Suit, reduced to $15 from $22.68.

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ) topped forecasts for half-year earnings and raised some of its full-year expectations on Tuesday despite continuing tough European mobile markets, sending its shares to a 12-month peak. \\n\\n British-based Vodafone said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the first half to September 30 rose to 6.24 billion pounds, well ahead of forecasts of between 5.98 billion and 6.19 billion. Underlying earnings per share also came in well ahead of the  average market forecast at 5.98 pence, and Vodafone stuck to its full-year forecasts for organic mobile revenue growth of 5-6.5 percent and EBITDA margins 1 percentage point lower. However, it raised its outlook for free cash flow to 4.7-5.2 billion pounds after it deferred around 700 million pounds in taxes and said it expected its effective tax rate for the full year and future years to be lower than previously indicated. \"The operating performance looks solid. The tax charge is a little bit lower which helped the earnings and the cash flows. But lower taxes is still cash in the bank. Very little to complain about, I would say,\" said Richard Marwood, fund manager at AXA Investments, a Vodafone shareholder. \"With this set of results Vodafone has further reduced investor uncertainty and reaffirmed progress on its business plan... Bulls have plenty to be happy about in these results,\" said Dresdner Kleinwort analyst Robert Grindle. Chief Executive Arun Sarin, who faced shareholder discontent earlier this year over the group\\'s slowing growth and strategy, said the growth had been flat in its mature European markets while its businesses in developing markets of eastern Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa had grown 14 percent. \"Pricing is coming down I\\'d say 15 percent in our European markets. The fact that we are adding a lot of customers helps us maintain our revenue (growth) of about 6 percent,\" said Sarin. Vodafone said it had added 12 million new customers in the half year, taking its total base to 191 million users. SURPRISE KNOCK The group unveiled a surprise 8.1-billion-pound ($15.5 billion) knock to the goodwill value at its German and Italian units, blaming higher interest rates along with pricing and continued regulatory pressures in the German market. The fresh impairment charge dragged it to a headline loss of 4.55 billion pounds. A similar impairment charge led Vodafone to report a 21.8-billion-pound loss in the last fiscal year, the biggest in European corporate history. Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford said nearly half -- 3.7 billion pounds -- of the goodwill hit stemmed from higher interest rates and the rest mainly from price cuts in Germany. However, shares in the group, already up 26 percent in the last 3 months, shrugged off the headline losses and rose as much as 4 percent, taking them to levels last seen just before interim results in November last year. By 1205 GMT, the stock was up 0.9 percent at 137-1/4 pence. The stock trades at nearly 13 times next year\\'s forecast earnings, compared with 14.1 percent for the European telecoms sector. Vodafone raised its interim dividend by 6.8 percent to 2.35 pence a share, and reaffirmed plans to pay out 60 percent of its earnings for the full year. The company has already stopped share buybacks this year, after spending billions last year. It also paid out a special dividend of 9 billion pounds last August, principally from the proceeds of its Japanese unit\\'s disposal to Softbank Corp. ( 9984.T ) earlier this year. CEO Sarin, under whose watch the once acquisitive behemoth is making selective disposals to refine its portfolio, doused hopes it could exit France or the Swiss markets in a hurry and dismissed reports it could do a deal with Russia\\'s Alfa group. Sarin said Vodafone was happy with its 44-percent stake in French mobile operator SFR and the chances of its sale to partner Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) were \"highly unlikely\" and if anything, Vodafone was interested in raising its stake at the right price. However, Sarin said Vodafone would look at a sale of its 25-percent stake in Swisscom Mobile ( SCMN.VX ) \"if there was a full offer put on the table\".',\n",

The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,\\nalleges that the investment firms formed \"clubs\" among\\nthemselves to bid collectively in buyout actions. It also\\ncharges that the firms exchanged information and submitted bids\\nat agreed-upon prices.  The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, cites news\\nreports of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice\\n\"into potential collusion by large buyout firms.\"  The lawsuit names big private equity firms including the\\nCarlyle Group [CYL.UL], Texas Pacific Group Ventures Inc.\\n[TPG.UL], the Blackstone Group [BG.UL] and Kohlberg Kravis\\nRoberts & Co. [KKR.UL]  It claims the plaintiffs \"were paid less for their equity\\nshares that they sold to the private equity defendants and\\ntheir co-conspirators than they would have been paid under\\nconditions of free and open competition.\"  This year, 901 private equity deals worth $289 billion have\\nbeen announced in the United States. That is nearly twice the\\nvalue of 12 months ago, according to research firm Dealogic.\\nBuyout firms accounted for 22 percent of global deal volume in\\nthe first nine months of the year.  \"I\\'m not concerned about collusion because I don\\'t think it\\nhappens. We\\'re viciously competitive with each other,\"\\nBlackstone Group President Tony James told the Reuters\\nInvestment Banking Summit on Tuesday.  \"Just publicity received puts a cloud on the industry, it\\nis bad for the industry\\'s image.

Lee Partners,\\nMadison Dearborn Partners, Warburg Pincus and Providence Equity\\nPartners.  Private equity firms typically buy companies using a small\\nportion of their own cash and borrow the rest. They often own a\\nbusiness for three to five years, restructure it, and then sell\\nit or launch an initial public offering of the company.  Buyout firms are raising increasingly larger funds and\\neyeing bigger takeover targets. Texas Pacific Group, for\\nexample, has closed a fund valued at just over $15 billion, a\\nsource familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.

Univision said\\non November 2 that the deal was expected to close in the first\\nquarter.  HCA, the No. 1 U.S. hospital operator, agreed to be\\nacquired by an investor group that includes Bain Capital, KKR,\\nand Merrill Lynch & Co.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. proposed an $8 billion takeover of bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. on Wednesday after an attempt at merger talks failed earlier this fall. \\n\\n The combined company would have the most flights across the Atlantic Ocean of any U.S. carrier and rank No. 2 in flights to and from the Caribbean, US Airways said. It could also lead to more airline mergers and prompt other offers for Delta. \"This is not value that either of our companies can create independently,\" US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker said on a conference call. \"If we wait for Delta to emerge from bankruptcy, it will be too late.\" Delta, the No. 3 U.S. airline with over 47,000 workers, said on Wednesday it intends to emerge from bankruptcy as a stand-alone carrier. \"We received a letter from US Airways this morning and will of course review it,\" Delta CEO Gerald Grinstein said in a statement. US Airways shares rose 16.1 percent after touching $59.45, the highest since its September 2005 merger with America West. Delta shares rose 10.2 percent in afternoon trade. The news also boosted shares of other airlines, with the Amex airline index up 5.5 percent. US Airways, the No. 7 U.S. airline with over 35,000 employees, said the combination would generate at least $1.65 billion in annual savings. It expects a transaction to close by the first half of 2007. SORT OF HOSTILE \"This appears to be sort of like a hostile takeover,\" CreditSights analyst Roger King said. \"US Airways is appealing directly to the creditors.\" Under terms of the offer, Delta creditors would receive $4 billion in cash and 78.5 million shares in US Airways, with an aggregate value of about $4 billion based on Tuesday\\'s closing stock price. After a merger, Delta\\'s unsecured creditors would own about 45 percent of the combined company, US Airways said. Delta\\'s 8.3 percent bonds due in 2029 rose 20 cents on the dollar to 60.25 cents, while the yield fell to 15 percent, according to MarketAxess. Airline bonds, led by Delta, were the most actively traded bonds on Wednesday. \"There is some room to increase the consideration,\" said Clark Orsky, a bond analyst with KDP Investment Advisors. \"At least it\\'s an indication that unsecured noteholders like what they see in this offer.\" US Airways has obtained $7.2 billion in committed financing for the deal from Citigroup. Citigroup is also advising US Airways on the offer \"It will be very tempting -- it\\'s got a cash component,\" said Fruman Jacobson of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, which represented the creditors\\' committee in UAL Corp.\\'s United Airlines bankruptcy. \"It is very unusual.\" MORE OFFERS SEEN With two major U.S. carriers -- Delta and Northwest Airlines Corp. -- operating in bankruptcy and with overcapacity in the industry, analysts have been expecting consolidation and said the offer could lead other airlines to join the fray. \"My sense is that clearly US Airways is underpaying compared with what Delta might get in an open market,\" said Frank Werner, an airline finance and management expert. \"It opens up opportunities for a United, for example, to come in and top the offer.\" United and Delta together could have a more expansive reach domestically and internationally, while a combination with US Airways would have more overlap, analysts said. \"Merger synergies are much better with United,\" CreditSights\\' King said. \"This is the right time, but the wrong airline.\" Parker and UAL\\'s CEO Glenn Tilton had previously approached Delta, operating under Chapter 11 protection since September 2005, about a merger, but Grinstein was not interested. Parker broached merger talks with Delta in a September 29 letter to Grinstein. According to Parker, Grinstein had \"declined to meet or even enter into discussions.\" ANTITRUST CONCERNS The offer is likely to be closely watched by the U.S. Justice Department, experts said. \"The big concern is government regulators, if they give the green light,\" Calyon Securities Ray Neidl said. \"If they do, it will probably set off a series of potential M&A activity in the industry.\" Parker, who in 2005 orchestrated the takeover of then-bankrupt US Air by America West, has the right credentials, analysts said. Parker said he expected Delta management to ultimately see a merger as a better alternative to remaining alone. \"We need to start working with Delta to do due diligence,\" Parker told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, adding that he had not heard from the company. \"What we believe will happen is that creditors see the value of this proposal.\" \"This is just sort of the first step in a long dance,\" Kenneth Jacobs, deputy chairman and head of the U.S. operations for Lazard Freres & Co., told the Reuters Investment Banking Summit. \"There are a lot of different ways this could play out; this is kind of like the opening scene.\" In later afternoon trade, US Airways shares were up $7.31 at $58.24 on the New York Stock Exchange, and Delta shares were up 14 cents at $1.61 in over-the-counter trading. Other airline shares also rose, including Airtran Holdings Inc., up 16.08 percent; JetBlue Airways Corp. up 7.81 percent; UAL Corp. up 9.16 percent; and Southwest Airlines Co. up 4.33 percent.

( GM.N ) fell through last month. \\n\\n \"An extension of the present alliance to a North American partner would make sense,\" Ghosn said, speaking to TV network CNBC. \"We are not in a hurry. For the moment, we are concentrating on (our) product offensive and watching carefully what\\'s going on in the marketplace.\" After nearly three months of talks, GM, Nissan and Renault announced in October that they would end their discussions on a possible partnership. GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said the automaker would benefit from the proposed alliance far less than Nissan and Renault. GM wanted to be compensated for the perceived imbalance, but Renault-Nissan said that demand contradicted the spirit of an alliance. \"One of the reasons is that we didn\\'t want to pay, but more generally ... we did not share the same ideas on how to make the synergies work,\" Ghosn told CNBC on Tuesday. Separately, the CEOs of GM, Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler AG\\'s DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group discussed their competitive concerns with President George W. Bush on Tuesday, including the Japanese yen, which they say is artificially undervalued and puts them at a competitive disadvantage. In response, Ghosn told CNBC that Nissan does not benefit from the weak currency. \"Today more than 80 percent of the cars we sell in the U.S. are made in the U.S. or North America,\" he said. \"If someone is benefiting from the currency, it\\'s certainly not us.\" Ghosn said Nissan faces the same problems of high healthcare and commodities costs in the U.S. market as the Big Three. \"We have the same problem, not the same magnitude,\" he said. \"We are also trying to put healthcare costs at a level consumers are willing to pay for.\" Ghosn also said he expects a slightly weaker U.S. market in 2007.',\n",

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials worried last month that inflation might not recede as hoped and an inflationary psychology could set in, making their job tougher, according to meeting minutes released on Wednesday. \\n\\n \"All members agreed that the risks to achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation remained of greatest concern,\" minutes of the Fed\\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee October 24-25 meeting said. \"Members noted that a significant amount of data would be published before the next committee meeting in December, giving the committee ample scope to refine its assessment of the economic outlook before judging whether any additional firming was needed to address those risks,\" the minutes said. Fed participants expressed concern that inflation expectations could drift upward if core inflation -- as measured when volatile fuel and energy costs are stripped out -- remain elevated for a protracted period. The Fed in October kept its benchmark overnight federal funds rate steady at 5.25 percent for the third meeting in a row, predicting that moderating economic growth would likely ease consumer price pressures. MESSAGE \"HAWKISH\" The minutes conveyed Fed concerns about the outlook for inflation, but expectations that core inflation would edge lower as economic growth slows, although it noted that there were dangers that price rises could fail to ease. \"All participants emphasized that the risks around the desired downward path to inflation remained to the upside,\" the minutes said. Prospects for Federal Reserve interest rate policy to remain on hold for several more months were solidified by Wednesday\\'s minutes. Futures prices show the Fed will hold policy steady through January as chances of a cut in the federal funds rate in March FFJ7 to 5 percent from the current 5.25 percent were last at 14 percent, down from as high as 40 percent on Tuesday. After the minutes release, U.S. Treasury debt prices extended losses while Wall Street stock prices pared gains but stayed in positive territory, and the dollar edged higher. \"The main message was a little bit of a hawkish one. They wanted to remind that they still have a bias toward raising rates if inflation remains as high as it has been over the past 12 months,\" said John Miller, head of fund management at Nuveen Investments in Chicago. Fed officials were confident that the economy would expand at a rate close to or a little below its long-run potential and that any drag the slowdown in housing activity would have would gradually wane. The slowdown in the housing market and declines in house price gains was not translating to a slowdown in consumer spending to date, the Fed said. \"Many participants drew some comfort from the most recent data, which suggested that the correction in the housing market was likely to be no more severe than they had previously expected and that the risk of an even larger contraction in this sector had ebbed,\" the minutes said. TIGHT LABOR MARKET But many participants expressed concerns that any significant home price declines could have a more pronounced impact on consumer and other spending. While the labor market remained tight, it was unclear from data whether wages were rising as a result, the minutes said. But members saw high profit margins as providing some scope for businesses to absorb increased labor costs without passing them on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Policy-makers also discussed the merits of inflation targeting at their meeting but felt the issue merited more deliberation, the minutes showed. \"The possible specification of a numerical price objective raised a number of complex and interrelated issues that required considerable further discussion,\" the minutes said. Participants agreed to continue their review of communication issues at the FOMC\\'s January meeting. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke believes adopting an explicit target would help the U.S. central bank anchor inflation expectations. But some other Fed policymakers have voiced concern that it might also deny them important policy flexibility. Democrats, who retook control of Congress in November 7 elections for the first time in 12 years, have also expressed worry that any target may be bad news for job growth. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate to seek both price stability and full employment.',\n",

       "  ' VANCOUVER, British Columbia  (Reuters) - Alcan Inc. AL.TO hit back on Wednesday at a report naming it as the company in Canada with the biggest pension shortfall and said the analysis did not take into account that it was not required to set aside retirement monies at its European operations. \\n\\n In a report released on Tuesday ratings agency Moody\\'s Investors Services said Alcan\\'s pension plan was underfunded to the tune of C$3.1 billion ($2.7 billion) at the end of 2005, putting it at the top of a list of Canadian companies that had Nortel Networks NT.TO in the No. 2 position and Bombardier Inc. ( BBDb.TO ) in third. Rhodri Harries, vice president and treasurer at Alcan, said about US$1 billion of the US$2.7 billion figure related to Alcan\\'s businesses in Europe, where pension plans were generally run on a \"pay as you go\" basis and \"unfunded by design.\" \"There is no regulatory requirement to fund them and no tax benefits,\" Harries told Reuters. He said the remaining sum of around US$1.7 billion did need to be funded, but the size of the liability was unsurprising given that Alcan is one of Canada\\'s biggest companies and hence would have a very large pension plan. Alcan is the world\\'s second largest-producer of primary aluminum. \"We are in a very good position to service those liabilities through the combination of the assets that we have put aside, through the strength of our business and through the strength of our balance sheet,\" Harries said. Moody\\'s said that an underfunded pension plan would not generally cause a change in a company\\'s credit rating on its own, but it could \"contribute materially\" to the overall rating assessment. It said telecom equipment giant Nortel\\'s pension plan was underfunded to the tune of C$2.9 billion at the end of 2005 and Bombardier\\'s was underfunded by C$2.6 billion. A Nortel spokesman said he was aware of the report but that the company had no comment at this time. Bombardier could not immediately be reached for comment. ($1 = $1.14 Canadian)',\n",
       "  ' HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), was set to announce victory in a protracted $3 billion bid for a Chinese bank on Thursday, beating rival Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), two sources close to the deal said on Wednesday. \\n\\n Citigroup, the world\\'s largest financial services provider, will take a 20-percent stake in southern China\\'s Guangdong Development Bank, while International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ) will take about 5 percent, the sources said. Citigroup, which will hold the single largest stake in the lender, was working with the Guangdong provincial government to organize a ceremony to be held on Thursday in Guangzhou, where Guangdong Development Bank is based, the sources said. \"Tomorrow, there will be a press conference in Guangzhou and Citigroup and local government staff are working together to pick a venue and to arrange the meeting,\" said a banking source. \"No doubt. Citigroup wins the bid,\" the source said, adding that the deal still needs final approval from China\\'s banking regulator. Officials at Citigroup, Societe Generale, Guangdong Development Bank and the Guangdong provincial government all declined to comment. \"It\\'s a landmark deal for Citigroup after it lost its bid for a stake in China Construction Bank ( 0939.HK ) to Bank of America ( BAC.N ),\" said Wu Yonggang, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai. Bank of America last year paid US$3 billion for 9 percent of China Construction Bank, the country\\'s top property lender, beating Citigroup and other foreign rivals eager to tap the country\\'s 10-percent economic growth, US$2 trillion in personal savings and a credit culture that is in its infancy. \"Now, Citigroup can fulfill its whole-China strategy by having Guangdong Bank in the south of China and Pudong Bank in the east of China, though we still need to see how the two local partners of Citigroup can cooperate with each other,\" he said. The Citigroup-led consortium is bidding to pay about US$3 billion for a combined 85-percent stake in the bank. Citigroup\\'s consortium includes top Chinese life underwriter, China Life Insurance ( 2628.HK ) ( LFC.N ), which will take a nearly 20-percent stake, making it the No. 2 shareholder in the Chinese bank, the sources said. Top Citigroup executives, including Chief Executive Charles Prince and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, now a member of Citigroup\\'s office of the chairman, were in Hong Kong this week for meetings. IBM Chief Executive Sam Palmisano was in Beijing on Tuesday. It was not known whether senior executives from Citigroup\\'s New York headquarters and representatives from IBM would attend the event to be held in Guangzhou on Thursday or not. Citigroup last year won preliminary approval to take a stake larger than 20 percent in Guangdong Bank, but that arrangement was later knocked down by regulators, re-opening the bidding with Societe Generale. China limits a single foreign owner to taking less than 20 percent in a bank, while total foreign investment in a Chinese bank is capped at less than 25 percent.

       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) dropped its bid for Euronext ENXT.PA and said on Wednesday a deal that would have been supported by both sides was no longer feasible, clearing the way for a rival bid from the New York Stock Exchange operator NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N. \\n\\n The management of Euronext, which runs the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon stock exchanges, has repeatedly rebuffed Deutsche Boerse in preference for a merger with NYSE Group. Confirming a Reuters report on Tuesday, Deutsche Boerse said in a brief statement it would \"stop all preparatory steps including the regulatory and merger control processes\". \"Politicians, stakeholders and regulators across Europe have confirmed their preference for a European solution,\" it said. \"Despite this broad support, the Euronext management did not reopen talks with Deutsche Boerse. However, Deutsche Boerse continues to believe that a combination of exchanges can only be successful if both sides willingly work together,\" it added. Deutsche Boerse\\'s withdrawal from the bid battle derails plans for a pan-European securities trading group, which have been cherished by many in continental Europe\\'s financial industry as well as monetary policy makers and politicians. Euronext had no immediate comment. The news came just hours after a group of seven leading investment banks said they planned to create a new pan-European equity trading platform next year to compete with Europe\\'s stock exchanges and reduce the cost of buying and selling shares. Analysts said Deutsche Boerse\\'s failure to win over Euronext and the new threat from the banks\\' planned trading platform meant the German group was now being squeezed from all sides. \"Deutsche Boerse is losing on two fronts,\" said LRP analyst Olaf Kayser. \"This will increase consolidation pressure on the sector. But Deutsche Boerse is now isolated.\" Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni played down the banks\\' move, telling a news conference in Frankfurt he did not believe the project was aimed specifically against it. \"I don\\'t think it is aimed specifically against Deutsche Boerse ... but against stock exchanges in general,\" Francioni said. \"I believe it is a serious effort.\" Both the Deutsche Boerse and NYSE bids for Euronext were a combination of stock and cash, meaning that the value of each fluctuated with the prices of shares in Deutsche Boerse and NYSE, respectively. When Euronext\\'s management agreed in early June to join forces with NYSE, the U.S. bid was worth around $10 billion. NYSE shares have risen almost 50 percent since then, while Deutsche Boerse\\'s are up by around 25 percent. Some analysts valued the German bid currently at 7 euros ($8.98) below NYSE\\'s offer per Euronext share. Francioni rejected an offer from NYSE and Euronext to join their planned tie-up, but added that Deutsche Boerse remained open to another deal with Euronext. \"The door is not closed if they approach us,\" he said. Deutsche Boerse shares were down 1.9 percent at 0913 GMT, paring some losses after the announcement, while Euronext shares extended losses to trade down 4.6 percent.

       "  ' LONDON/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) dropped a $10 billion bid for Euronext ENXT.PA on Wednesday, dashing French and German hopes for a European mega-exchange that would put Euronext beyond the reach of the New York Stock Exchange. \\n\\n The collapse of proposals backed by French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Angela Merkel is good news for Euronext, which has opted to merge with NYSE, but it coincided with plans by top banks to leapfrog the exchanges with a new market. Traditional financial exchanges on both sides of the Atlantic have been in frenzied merger negotiations for the past two years amid pressure on costs and new European rules allowing banks to trade stock directly with each other. The management of Euronext, which runs the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon stock exchanges, has repeatedly rebuffed Deutsche Boerse in preference for an agreed bid from New York Stock Exchange operator NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N. Deutsche Boerse said in a brief statement it would \"stop all preparatory steps including the regulatory and merger control processes\". The announcement confirmed comments on Tuesday from sources close to Deutsche Boerse that the exchange was seriously considering dropping the bid. \"They were never going to win but now will have to tie up with maybe the Scandinavian or southern European exchanges,\" said one analyst who declined to be named. Deutsche Boerse\\'s withdrawal coincided with a deadline for it to submit remedies to the European Union Commission to address competition issues raised by a Franco-German deal. RIVAL EXCHANGES Euronext declined to comment on Deutsche Boerse\\'s decision, which derailed plans for a pan-European securities trading group, an idea cherished by many in continental Europe\\'s financial industry as well as monetary policymakers and politicians. Europlace, a powerful French financial lobby, said it was sorry that Deutsche Boerse did not discuss a proposal, made in a report commissioned by Europlace, to merge only the two groups\\' cash equity trading business. Euronext had welcomed the Europlace proposal but said such a deal would be done in parallel to its merger with the NYSE. Deutsche Boerse said a trilateral deal was not an option. Shares in Deutsche Boerse closed 4.6 percent lower, while Euronext\\'s were down 5.4 percent. Both stocks have nearly tripled in value in the past year on bid speculation. Dealers said the shares were rattled by the setback for European consolidation but added that a bigger factor was concern that the investment banks\\' plans for a rival pan-European exchange would take away market share. Citigroup ( C.N ), Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Merrill Lynch MER.N, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) said in a statement they would form a new company with an independent management team to create a pan-European equity trading platform next year. \"It\\'s an open secret banks have been extremely unhappy about costs of dealing,\" said Richard Murley, managing director at UK investment bank Rothschild and former head of the UK Takeover Panel. \"It\\'s a pretty serious opportunity. The real question is whether they can attract the liquidity,\" Murley told the Reuters Investment Banking Summit in London. Dealers and analysts said the banks\\' move was a tactic to force the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) and others to lower their fees. SERIOUS THREAT Fees are also likely to come under pressure with an expected increase in competition when the European Union\\'s new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which aims to open up crossborder European trading in financial markets, takes effect in a year\\'s time. Andrew Mitchell, an analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton, said the venture was potentially a serious threat to the main equities exchanges in Europe. In September, a grouping of the same seven investment banks plus ABN AMRO AAH.AS and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) said it was considering setting up its own system for reporting share trades, bypassing major European bourses. But the banks have a challenge on their hands, given that previous attempts to create rival exchanges, such as Nasdaq Europe and Jiway, have failed, analysts said. \"Their ability to succeed depends on the strength of the common threat that they face,\" said Jim Gollan, chief executive of virt-x, a crossborder exchange owned by the SWX Group, which operates the Swiss exchange. \"The banks are concerned that the for-profit exchanges charge too much.\" \"The situation has got truly out of control. Volume has increased dramatically; at the same time our business is becoming a much lower-margin business. The economic pain is acute,\" said a banker from one of the investment banks in the group who declined to be named. \"There is a collective will to own what we regard as a utility business,\" he added. \"And developments in technology have made what was once a difficult and expensive design problem much easier.\" No one was available to comment on the matter at the London Stock Exchange, a long-running bid target whose shares rose last week on speculation that a new bid was imminent -- possibly from major shareholder Nasdaq Stock Markets ( NDAQ.O ).

The announcement confirmed what a source familiar with the matter had told Reuters late on Tuesday. The plan comes as stock exchanges, such as the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), Euronext ENXT.PA and Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ), have seen their share prices rise amid expectations of consolidation. Deutsche Boerse, however, was seriously considering dropping a bid it has made for Euronext, sources close to the Frankfurt stock exchange operator have told Reuters. The management of Euronext, which runs the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon stock exchanges, is committed to a merger with U.S. NYSE Group Inc NYX.N. NEW EUROPEAN RULES The seven investment banks -- which account for almost half of the exchange trading in European equities as well as being dominant players in off-exchange trading -- said their rival platform would take advantage of new European rules that come into force next November. The European Union\\'s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) hopes to create a pan-European market in financial services that will ensure customers get value for money and greater transparency. \"We are responding to the MiFID legislation by creating an integrated pan-European trading platform where equities can be traded more cost effectively, obtaining significant liquidity with greater efficiency for each and every participant in the equity markets,\" a spokesman for the banks said. The banks will be shareholders in the new entity and have committed to financing it. The spokesman declined to say how much money each planned to inject, but said they had also committed people and resources. The intention was to attract liquidity from across Europe, the banks\\' statement said. The platform aimed to \"reduce the costs of buying and selling shares and promote greater transparency of equity prices and volumes,\" the statement said. The spokesman said the new company was tentatively being called Project European MTF (Multilateral Trading Facility) until a full-time name was agreed upon.

WB.N on Wednesday said it plans to shut about 200 branches nationwide by the end of 2008 as it focuses on aggressive expansion in California, Texas and the U.S. southwest. \\n\\n The No. 4 U.S. bank, which operates 3,400 branches, joins rivals such as Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ) that are closing branches to focus on faster-growing markets and businesses. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia expects to open 100 to 130 branches in 2007, but few in the eastern part of the country, including New York. It expects next year to open 25 to 30 branches in southern California, which it entered in March. \"We\\'re expanding in the high-growth markets,\" said Ben Jenkins, head of Wachovia\\'s retail and business banking unit, at a Merrill Lynch & Co. financial services conference. \"We\\'re consolidating in the lower opportunity markets that have had traffic pattern changes.\" He said Wachovia plans to close about 100 branches a year \"at least for the next two years.\" Like most U.S. banks, Wachovia is battling the convergence of long- and short-term interest rates, which narrowed the gap between what it earns on loans and pays on deposits. Wachovia added 19 branches in California in March when it paid $3.8 billion for auto lender Westcorp Inc. and its WFS Financial Inc. affiliate. In October, Wachovia paid $24.3 billion for Golden West Financial Corp., an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) specialist with 285 World Savings Bank branches in 10 states. Wachovia was criticized for the purchase amid signs of a housing slowdown. But Jenkins said Golden West\\'s loan originations and margins were \"pretty stable\" in October, despite \"a pretty tough market with an inverted yield curve.\" He said the combined company\\'s \"pay option\" ARM business, which involves loans that let borrowers choose how much to pay each month, will in 2007 be \"materially better\" than in 2006. In New York, Wachovia has opened about 19 branches in Manhattan, including many intended to serve customers who commute to work from the suburbs, and five on Long Island. Jenkins said he would \"love to have\" 25 branches in Manhattan and 10 on Long Island. But he added: \"I don\\'t see any need for acquisitions here. I think we can build in Manhattan in just the locations we want, and do very well.\" Seattle-based Washington Mutual, the largest savings and loan, in September announced plans to close 80 branches within a year, including many around Atlanta and Chicago.',\n",

The Kyoto-based video game maker also said it plans to ship 1.5 million units of the DS in December in Japan, doubling the availability from levels in recent months for the critical year-end shopping season. Last month Nintendo raised its DS sales target by 18 percent to 20 million units for the year to March, and it reported more than threefold growth in profits for April-September.

Skinner said that McDonald\\'s was still working very hard on lowering the level of trans fats in its french fries.

Chicken salads and a low-priced chicken snack wrap have been part of McDonald\\'s growth strategy this year.

Other test items include cinnamon buns and burritos for the breakfast menu. McDonald\\'s is also looking at adding more \"grab and go\" beverages, Skinner told investors at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer & Retail Conference. Another area Skinner discussed was advertising. He said that television now represents 70 percent of McDonald\\'s advertising budget, down from 85 percent five years ago, as the company has beefed up its effort to reach customers online. CFO Matthew Paull also said that McDonald\\'s still expects to spend $1.8 billion on capital expenditures in 2006.

In addition, the company said it will restate past years\\' results after an investigation into stock options. Shares rose 64 cents, or 2 percent, to $30.54 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said net income rose 38 percent to $1.27 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended on September 29, from $917 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items and discontinued operations, profit was 51 cents per share, two cents a share ahead of analysts\\' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. \"In terms of the bottom line, it\\'s a good quarter,\" said Brian Loftus, an analyst with Maple Asset Management, which owns Tyco shares. \"Fire and security had a great quarter.\" Revenue rose 8 percent to $10.76 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts of $10.55 billion. Three of Tyco\\'s four divisions posted double-digit percentage sales gains, and all four reported double-digit increases in operating profit. GETTING HEALTH CARE \\'ON TRACK\\' \"We\\'ve got good trends and it can get so much better if health care can get back on track,\" Loftus said, adding that health care contributes more than a third of company profits, but posted lower profit margins compared with recent quarters. The division, which is recovering from product recalls earlier in the year, reported 3 percent sales growth in the quarter. \"While health care organic growth was disappointing in the quarter, we believe it was overshadowed by the strong organic growth in the company\\'s other businesses,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Jack Kelly said in a research note. Separately, Tyco said it expects to file documents with regulators in mid-January 2007 detailing its break-up plan. Tyco has essentially completed picking management teams and boards for the companies, Chief Executive Ed Breen said, and will hold an investor day after filing separation documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Tyco Electronics will retain its name, while Tyco International will encompass the company\\'s fire and security and engineered products businesses, Breen said. The company is working on a new name for its health care division. The company also said it expected up to $600 million in restructuring charges, mostly in the current fiscal year. The fire and security segment will incur the most costs. The program will include some job cuts, and the closure of offices and plants, and will lead to cash savings of $50 million in fiscal 2007, $200 million in 2008 and $300 million annually by 2009, Tyco said. The company also said it expected first-quarter earnings of 42 to 44 cents per share from continuing operations, before special items. Analysts were expecting 45 cents. Tyco said an internal review of stock option practices has found several errors, and will restate results for several years prior to 2006. The company\\'s stock option accounting had errors resulting from incomplete documentation of grants made between 1999 and 2002, when the company was headed by former CEO Dennis Kozlowski, who is serving a prison sentence after being convicted of defrauding Tyco. The company also found unintentional misapplication of accounting principles and inadequate controls, and an error related to compensation expenses. These errors resulted in an aggregate compensation expense of $281 million, or $191 million after taxes.',\n",

The S&P Airlines Index rose 4.6 percent, while US Airways stock soared 16.8 percent, or $8.53, to $59.46 on the New York Stock Exchange. \"If the deal were concluded, you\\'d probably see more upside bias for the market,\" said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 33.70 points, or 0.28 percent, to end at a record 12,251.71. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index added 3.35 points, or 0.24 percent, to finish at 1,396.57. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 12.09 points, or 0.50 percent, to close at 2,442.75. During the session, the Dow hit a lifetime intraday high at 12,291.73, while the S&P 500 climbed as high as 1,401.35, its highest level in six years, and the Nasdaq jumped to 2,452.56, its highest mark in almost six years. A sell-off in bank stocks, including Wells Fargo & Co., also cut into the session\\'s advance as the yield spread between the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes briefly widened to 20 basis points, marking the deepest inversion since December 2000. When the yield curve is inverted with longer maturities\\' yields trading below those of shorter maturities, investors have traditionally interpreted the phenomenon as a sign of an economic downturn or recession. For banks and other lenders, the yield-curve inversion raises funding costs. \"The Fed is talking a bit hawkish and people are starting to take a bit of profits off of that since we\\'ve had such a nice run-up,\" said Tom Schrader, managing director of U.S. equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore. Credit Suisse said it reinstated coverage of Web search leader Google with an \"outperform\" rating following the completion of its acquisition of Internet video-sharing company YouTube. It also raised its price target on Google to $600. Google\\'s stock rose 0.5 percent, or $2.63, to $491.93 on Nasdaq and came within a whisker of the $500 milestone. Google was one of the biggest gainers in the Nasdaq 100, while news of a possible multibillion-dollar plane order caused Boeing Co. shares to climb and lead the Dow\\'s advance. Boeing shares ended up 1.6 percent, or $1.34, at $87.08 on the NYSE. Among the S&P 500\\'s biggest gainers was chip maker Intel Corp., which rose after Franco-Italian rival STMicroelectronics said it would withdraw from the flash memory chip market, an area in which Intel competes. Intel shares gained 2 percent, or 44 cents, to $22.32 on the Nasdaq. After Goldman Sachs raised its rating on Altria Group Inc., the stock shot up 1.4 percent, or $1.11, to $82.25 on the NYSE. Altria gave the second-biggest boost to the Dow. The Philadelphia Keefe Bruyette index of bank stocks slipped 0.3 percent. Shares of Wells Fargo & Co., the No. 5 U.S. bank, dropped 1.3 percent, or 48 cents, to $36.23 on the NYSE.',\n",

( CCU.N ), the No. 1 U.S. radio company, was evaluating two takeover offers at a board meeting on Wednesday, sources familiar with the situation said. \\n\\n Two teams of private equity firms submitted offers, sources have previously told Reuters. The value of the bids was not immediately available. Clear Channel, which has 1,150 stations, has a market capitalization of about $16.8 billion. The deliberations by Clear Channel\\'s board stretched into Wednesday afternoon and the timing of a decision was unclear, sources said. A decision could be made on Wednesday or Thursday, but may be delayed if the company seeks additional information from the bidders or asks for a new round of offers, one source said. The company also could reject the bids outright, the source said. One bidding group consisted of Providence Equity Partners, The Blackstone Group BG.UL and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL, while the second team included Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL, sources previously said. The private equity firms and Clear Channel declined to comment. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the teams had submitted separate offers worth more than $36 a share, and had planned to submit revised bids ahead of Clear Channel\\'s board meeting on Wednesday. Shares of Clear Channel closed at $34.12, up 1 cent, on the New York Stock Exchange. The New York Times said a winning offer would likely end up below $37 a share, which was below some analysts\\' expectations that reached as high as $40 a share. \"I don\\'t think a deal will happen at $36. I don\\'t think shareholders will approve it. I think the price is too low. A price of $38 to $42 per share is a fair value,\" said Kit Spring, an analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. \"I think investors may be displeased at how quickly the bidding process has gone. I think a higher price can be achieved if some of the assets were sold piecemeal before a private equity buyout was considered,\" Spring said. Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, Texas, said last month it was evaluating strategic alternatives and had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) to advise it.

       "  ' NEW ORLEANS  (Reuters) - The latest federal case involving Merck & Co. Inc.\\'s ( MRK.N ) withdrawn arthritis drug Vioxx on Wednesday went to a jury that will decide if the drugmaker failed to adequately warn a plaintiff\\'s nurse practitioner about heart attack risks associated with the medicine. \\n\\n In closing arguments in U.S. District Court in New Orleans, the attorney for plaintiff Charles Mason told jurors that Merck knew Vioxx could cause heart attacks and actively suppressed critical information about the health risks of the pain drug. \"They knew before the drug ever went on the market that there was a risk of heart attack,\" Mason\\'s attorney, Ed Blizzard, argued. \"The fact of the matter is they weren\\'t trying to warn anybody.\" Mason, 61, who took Vioxx for 10 months to treat back pain from an old injury, blames the drug for the heart attack he suffered in 2003. Merck pulled the drug from the market in September of 2004 after a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients taking it for at least 18 months. At last count, the New Jersey-based drugmaker was facing nearly 24,000 lawsuits from people who claim to have been harmed by the drug that once had $2.5 billion a year in sales. Merck\\'s lawyers argued that other risk factors and not Vioxx were to blame for Mason\\'s heart attack. \"He had plaque in his arteries and that\\'s what caused his heart attack,\" Merck attorney Phil Beck told the jury. Merck also argued that the company\\'s scientific evidence showed the increased heart risk from Vioxx came only after 18 months of continuous use and noted that Mason took the drug for 10 months. They also pointed out that he had ceased taking Vioxx a few days before the heart attack. Mason\\'s lawyers maintained that the adverse effect of the drug lasted longer than the four or five days that their client had stopped taking the medicine. Of 10 Vioxx lawsuits that have gone to a jury verdict so far, Merck has won six of them. But a New Jersey state court judge ordered one of the victories to be retried after ruling that some new evidence had come to light. The federal trials have been presided over by U.S. District Court Judge Eldon Fallon.',\n",
       "  ' NEW ORLEANS  (Reuters) - A New Orleans jury swiftly handed Merck & Co. Inc. ( MRK.N ) a victory on Wednesday in a federal lawsuit over its withdrawn arthritis drug Vioxx, deliberating for about 90 minutes before finding the company adequately warned of the risks associated with the drug. \\n\\n In one of thousands of Vioxx lawsuits it faces, Merck successfully defended itself against claims that it hid the Vioxx heart risks and that the pain medicine was responsible for a 2003 heart attack suffered by plaintiff Charles Mason. \"Obviously we\\'re disappointed,\" said Mason\\'s attorney, Ed Blizzard. \"We thought the evidence showed that Merck failed to warn Mr. Mason\\'s family practitioner about the risks. Obviously the jury disagreed with us.\" Had the jury found Merck failed to adequately warn of the Vioxx health risks, it would have been asked to determine if the drug was the primary cause of the heart attack and to determine monetary damages. Mason, 61, who took Vioxx for 10 months to treat back pain from an old injury, blamed the drug for his 2003 heart attack. Trial testimony included that he had stopped taking Vioxx a few days before the attack. Attorneys for Merck argued that the company had followed all government guidelines in reporting health risks associated with the medicine, and that Mason\\'s heart attack was caused by other health risk factors and not by Vioxx. \"We thought the evidence showed clearly that first, Mr. Mason had not taken Vioxx for several days before his heart attack, and second, that there was no (blood) clot that could have come from Vioxx,\" said Merck attorney Phil Beck. Evidence presented by doctors during the trial showed that a medical procedure performed on Mason did not find a blood clot that might have been caused by Vioxx and led to a heart attack. Merck pulled the drug from the market in September 2004 after a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients taking it for at least 18 months. At last count, the New Jersey-based drugmaker was facing nearly 24,000 lawsuits from people who claim to have been harmed by the drug that once had $2.5 billion a year in sales. Merck has steadfastly insisted it will try each case on an individual basis rather that discuss a comprehensive settlement agreement with plaintiffs. \"This is a satisfying verdict for Merck,\" Merck General Counsel Kenneth Frazier said in a statement. \"Juries across the country in both state and federal courts have determined that the company acted responsibly in properly disclosing data to the medical community.\" Of 11 Vioxx lawsuits that have gone to a jury verdict, Merck has now won seven. However, a New Jersey state court judge ordered one of the victories to be retried after ruling that some new evidence had come to light. David Logan, dean of the Roger Williams University School of Law in Rhode Island, said he believes Merck will let several more trials play out before deciding whether to continue litigating or enter into a broad settlement with plaintiffs. A state court Vioxx trial with two plaintiffs is currently underway in California. The next federal Vioxx trial, all of which are being overseen by U.S. District Court Judge Eldon Fallon of the Eastern District of Louisiana, is set to begin on November 27.

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has until Thursday next week to provide rival firms with outstanding details of its software systems or face fresh fines, the EU\\'s antitrust chief said, according to the Guardian newspaper. \\n\\n Neelie Kroes gave the U.S. software giant until Thanksgiving Day in the United States to reveal the relevant information about its Windows operating system, the newspaper reported. Microsoft could face a fine of up to 3 million euros ($3.85 million) a day it if failed to comply, it added. Kroes told the Guardian that she was growing tired of waiting for Microsoft to meet her demands. \"I don\\'t have eternal life,\" she said in an interview. \"I am not impressed if someone says 90 percent of the information is already there when we need 100 percent. It\\'s a jigsaw and some parts are missing ... In my opinion, this information should have been here a couple of months ago.\" Microsoft has had a long-running legal battle with Brussels over its software and last month promised the European Union\\'s Executive Commission it would alter its new Vista operating system to enable rival firms to develop ancillary software. In 2004, the Commission found Microsoft had abused its market dominance in audiovisual software players and office servers. It forced the U.S. firm to strip out Windows Media Player from its ubiquitous operating system. The Commission levied a record 497 million euro fine. In July, EU regulators fined the company a further 280.5 million euros for defying the ruling, which required it to share information on its servers with rivals.',\n",
       "  ' BELLEVUE, Washington  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. is making a \"big bold bet\" on Web services, which it sees as the most important technological development of the next decade, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Tuesday. \\n\\n But the software company, whose online division is losing money while rivals like Google Inc. thrive, has a unique vision of how these new services will evolve. Microsoft believes Web services will work in tandem with PC-installed software, a vision that differs from that of \"software as a service\" advocates, such as Salesforce.com and Google, who expect services delivered over the Web to replace traditional software. \"We believe this shift is the most important technological transformation during the next decade,\" Ballmer said at the company\\'s annual shareholder meeting. Microsoft has invested heavily to expand data centers to house servers and provide the infrastructure to host blogs, e-mail services for small businesses and a slew of other new Web services as part of its \"Live\" strategy. Calling Microsoft a company with multiple core businesses, Ballmer said its online services group is the software giant\\'s \"fourth core\" in addition to desktop software, computer server software and its entertainment initiatives. \"As we look to the future, this fourth core represents our big bold bet on the shift to software plus online services,\" Ballmer said. Google has already encroached on Microsoft\\'s Office desktop turf with online spreadsheet and word processing software, while Microsoft\\'s own Office Live lets small businesses set up Web sites, company-branded e-mail and Web applications to allow project management and collaboration. Office Live is free for the ad-supported basic offering and Microsoft charges a monthly subscription for the more elaborate version. It works with the Office software suite but the programs are largely different from those on the desktop. Having dominated the desktop with Office and its Windows operating system, Microsoft arrived late to the online services game and allowed smaller, more nimble competitors such as Web search leaders Google and Yahoo Inc. to build billion-dollar businesses around ad-supported Web services. Microsoft\\'s desktop business accounts for more than half of its $44 billion in annual sales and most of its profits. But its online services group lost $136 million in the three months ended September 30 as sales fell 4 percent to $539 million, due to a decline in its Web access business and investments to add staff and expand data centers. By contrast, Google, which makes nearly all its money from advertising, made a net profit of $733 million last quarter and revenue surged 70 percent from a year ago to $2.69 billion. Microsoft took the wraps off its Windows Live search engine in September, but it has made few inroads against Google, which is so closely associated with online search that its name is also a verb in the dictionary. Microsoft rolled out a software system called adCenter in the United States this year to centralize advertising revenue for its ad-supported online services. Ballmer noted the company has introduced 20 online services in the last year alone. There are signs of progress. Microsoft reported 5 percent ad revenue growth last quarter, driven by Web display ads that accompany its sites, e-mail and instant messaging services. Still, analysts say don\\'t expect results overnight. It was only a year ago that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called the company to arms in a memo, calling for a new approach to handle a \"sea change\" from online services. Morningstar analyst Toan Tran says Microsoft\\'s approach of augmenting desktop software with online services is sensible, adding that it has the cash to build the necessary technology. \"This is an initiative we have to wait at least five years to see how it pans out. The way people use their computers is not going to change overnight,\" Tran said.',\n",
       "  ' MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australian retailer Coles Myer Ltd. CML.AX, which last month rejected an A$18.2 billion (US$14 billion) bid from a private equity consortium, posted a weaker-than-expected 3.2 percent rise in first-quarter sales, sending its shares down more than 1 percent. \\n\\n The company, Australia\\'s second-largest retailer after Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ), reaffirmed its forecast for little change in annual earnings as it cuts costs and overhauls it operations, pursuing plans it says will drive more value than the rejected bid. \"The first quarter sales figures in a number of respects are a little bit disappointing, however the company has maintained its profit guidance for the full year,\" Shaw Stockbroking analyst Scott Marshall said. \"The market needs further confidence that the company is able to achieve its profit target.\" Coles Myer, which in the past year has sold its Myer department stores, said sales from continuing businesses were A$8.5 billion ($6.5 billion) for the 13 weeks ended October 29, up from A$8.2 billion a year ago, but below an average forecast of A$8.77 billion from two analysts surveyed by Reuters. Coles Myer shares were down 0.9 percent at A$13.61 in early afternoon trade in a wider market up 0.4 percent. Its major food and liquor division posted sales growth of 6.3 percent in the first quarter, with comparable sales from stores open at least a year rising 3.3 percent, excluding Bi-Lo supermarkets which are in the process of being rebranded as Coles stores. Food inflation was about 4 percent during the quarter, driven by escalating fresh food prices. The informal takeover offer, from a private equity consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, would have been Australia\\'s biggest corporate takeover. It valued Coles Myer at an earnings multiple a third higher than that commanded by world market leader Wal-Mart. IMPROVEMENTS EXPECTED Coles Chief Executive John Fletcher said rebranded stores were achieving sales increases averaging around 7-8 percent and comparable store sales growth overall was expected to improve as the wider business improvement plan took effect. \"We think as the strategic initiatives do gain traction, we do expect food and liquor comps to continue to trend upwards,\" he told reporters. The company\\'s Target variety stores posted a 2.8 percent rise in comparable store sales, but weaker comparable sales were reported from its Kmart discount variety stores, Officeworks and the Coles Express fuel and convenience store business. Coles Express comparable sales fell 5.7 percent as a store network upgrade program started during the quarter caused some disruption. The company said Kmart posted an overall sales rise of 1.2 percent, while comparable sales fell 2.2 percent as it divested its Tyremaster wholesale business and three Garden SuperCentres and phased out unprofitable lines in some categories. Fletcher said the impact of rising interest rates and the drought, offset by a fall in fuel prices, was likely to see its shoppers \"remaining cautious and value-conscious\", but he said the food and liquor business would be less affected. \"I think supermarkets is one of those businesses where people tend to be pretty consistent in their buying behaviors,\" he said. The company has forecast a flat net profit of A$787 million this year and has also forecast a profit of A$1.066 billion in fiscal 2008. Rival Woolworths last month posted a 21 percent rise in its first quarter sales, boosted by acquisitions, and said its comparable food and liquor sales from stores open at least a year increased 4.9 percent.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Charming Shoppes Inc. CHRS.O, a retailer that specializes in plus-size apparel for women, posted an 80 percent jump in quarterly earnings on Wednesday after better inventory management helped boost profit margins, but shares sagged on fears sales growth could slow due to disappointing denim demand and less seasonal merchandise. \\n\\n The stock had risen more than 3 percent in early trading, its highest level since 1993, but after a conference call in which the company said premium denim sales at its Lane Bryant stores had lagged expectations and that it would limit its Fashion Bug chain\\'s fall holiday offerings, shares slid as much as 5 percent. \"There are several factors that will limit potential upside in the near term,\" C.L. King analyst Scott Krasik wrote in a research note, referring to the Lane Bryant and Fashion Bug outlook. He cut his stock rating to \"neutral\" from \"strong buy\" and said the share price already reflected the business outlook for the company and there was little room for gains. Charming Shoppes reported third-quarter net income of $19.4 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with $10.8 million, or 9 cents per share, for the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had forecast earnings of 13 cents per share, on average. Sales rose 5 percent to $695.3 million. \"Entering the quarter with clean inventories resulted in improvements in our merchandise margin, which contributed to our better-than-planned earnings results,\" Dorrit Bern, chairman, chief executive officer and president, said in a statement. Consolidated gross margin rose to 31.2 percent, up from 30.4 percent. The company also said demand at its outlet stores also helped boost results. SAME-STORE SALES Same-store sales, a measure of sales at stores open at least a year, rose 1 percent during the quarter, a result the company called disappointing. Comparable-store sales at the company\\'s Lane Bryant unit were flat, which it attributed to disappointing sales for its premium denim offerings. Additionally, Charming Shoppes said it would keep to its strategy of cutting back on seasonal inventories at its Fashion Bug chain. \"That could have some implications on top line but it absolutely gives you the opportunity to expand gross and operating margin,\" said Chief Financial Officer Eric Specter, in a conference call. After its better-than-expected third-quarter results, the company said it had raised its full-year earnings outlook to 84 cents to 85 cents per share, from its earlier forecast for earnings the range of 81 cents to 83 cents per share. Analysts expected full-year profit of 82 cents per share. For the fourth quarter, the company said it still expects earnings of 21 cents to 22 cents per share, on sales of $880 million to $890 million. Analysts are looking for earnings of 21 cents per share, on revenue of $873.2 million. Charming Shoppes shares were down 69 cents at $14.39, compared with a 0.7 percent gain for the Dow Jones US apparel and retail index. .DJUSRA The stock was selling for 15.5 times next year\\'s expected earnings, as of Tuesday\\'s close, compared with an average 17.2 times average earnings for companies in the apparel and retail index.',\n",
       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - British supermarket operator J. Sainsbury Plc ( SBRY.L ) said its recovery was on track as it reported a 60 percent surge in underlying first-half pretax profit to 189 million pounds ($359 million). \\n\\n Halfway through a three-year turnaround plan, results on Wednesday from Britain\\'s third-largest grocer by market share kept the group on track to meet its target of 2.5 billion pounds of total of extra sales by 2008. Chief Executive Justin King said price cuts and Sainsbury\\'s focus on fresh and healthy food -- the subject of an advertising campaign fronted by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver -- had returned it to favor with customers. \"We have made good progress during the first six months of the year, reporting our seventh consecutive quarter of like-for-like sales growth, our best performance for many years,\" King said at a press conference. Sainsbury, which struggled in recent years to keep up with market leader Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc\\'s ( WMT.N ) Asda, said it had raised its interim dividend 11.6 percent to 2.4 pence per share. Remarking on the start of the Christmas shopping period, King said price competition had remained \"as vigorous in recent weeks and months as it has ever been\". He cautioned the second half would be \"a steep curve\" due to tough comparables last year, when Sainsbury\\'s notched up 5 percent growth in the last quarter, but reiterated his aim to achieve average growth of 3.0 to 3.5 percent during the three year plan. Sainsbury, with nearly 16 percent share of Britain\\'s grocery market, or around half that of Tesco, also reported break-even at an operating level at Sainsbury\\'s Bank. Reported pretax profit for the six months ended October 7, including one-off items, reached 194 million pounds, just beating an average forecast of 192 million in a Reuters poll. Total sales rose 8.3 percent to 9.6 billion pounds. BID SPECULATION Sainsbury\\'s shares were the highest gainers on the DJ Stoxx index of European retailers .SXRP in the past five days, on high expectations from the results and speculation the one-time bid target could again be in private equity\\'s sights. The stock traded down 0.8 percent at 409-1/4 pence by 0930 GMT, on what analysts said was profit taking. \"The shares look very expensive on earnings multiples but we think that a bidder prepared to sell on the property could pay 500 pence a share,\" Numis analysts said in a note. Sainsbury shares trade at 30 times full-year 2006 earnings, well above the DJ Stoxx European retailers .SXRP average of 18 times, Reuters data showed. King declined to comment on the private equity speculation, centered on core shareholder Lord David Sainsbury\\'s resignation from the UK government last week. The move triggered the release of his family\\'s 16 percent stake from the \"blind trust\" they have been locked in since Sainsbury entered government eight years ago. \"We never comment on market rumor and speculation other than to say we are aware of our obligations to report and we have nothing to report,\" King said. He said he also did not expect to have a conversation with Sainsbury, a member of the supermarket\\'s founding family, until \"some time after\" the shares are fully released from the trust in three months\\' time.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - On the prowl for the best deals from U.S. retailers this Thanksgiving weekend? A quick check online can provide the answers that retailers are not yet ready to reveal. \\n\\n Numerous Web sites have cropped up in recent years that publish in advance what they claim are copies of the newspaper ads retailers will run for Black Friday -- the day after Thanksgiving, which marks the chaotic and ultra-competitive launch of the holiday shopping season. A visit to BlackFriday.info ( www.blackfriday.info/ ) reveals that Circuit City Stores Inc. will be selling an Olevia 32-inch high-definition LCD TV for $499 from 5 a.m. until 11 a.m. on Black Friday, while Sears will sell a men\\'s leather coat for $49.99. Another Web site, Black Friday Ads ( bfads.net ) says Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will be offering a 42-inch high-definition plasma television for $988 from 5 a.m. until 11 a.m., while supplies last, on November 24. Jon Vincent, founder of BlackFriday.info, said he gets copies of the ads from employees working at newspaper distribution facilities, who take snapshots of the inserts and send them to his site. Vincent said he does not call the retailers to verify the information, but he makes sure the pictures look legitimate and the prices seem reasonable before posting them. \"People are really interested to find out what\\'s on sale on Black Friday,\" he said. \"If they know a plasma TV is going to be on sale for $500 off, they\\'re not going to buy it now, they\\'ll just wait until Black Friday and then they\\'ll buy it then.\" But retailers are not happy having their holiday sales plans revealed ahead of schedule to either shoppers or to their competitors. Black Friday Ads said privately held home goods retailer Linens \\'n Things sent a letter asking it to remove the information from the site or it would take legal action. Linens \\'n Things did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. BlackFriday.info had a note on its site on November 13 saying it had removed a Best Buy Co. Inc. advertisement after the electronics retailer threatened to try to shut the site down. \"We can\\'t really fight Best Buy,\" Vincent said. A Best Buy spokesman said he was unaware of the note posted on BlackFriday.info, but said the retailer does not acknowledge or comment on \"rumor\" sites. But it is hard to make the information disappear once it is online. The day after BlackFriday.info removed the Best Buy ad, Black Friday Ads had a copy of what looked like a Best Buy newspaper insert, promoting a 42-inch LCD high-definition TV for $999.99, after $500 in instant savings, until noon on Black Friday. BlackFriday.info\\'s Vincent said this is the third year his site has published Black Friday deals. While every year one or two retailers complain, he does not expect that to hinder these sites. \"Retailers have had power for so many years and now with the Internet, you can share all this information and it really gets more information out to consumers,\" he said.',\n",

Slide\\'s new financing round was led by Mayfield Fund and includes investments from Khosla Ventures and two previous investors, BlueRun Ventures and Founders Fund. Exact terms were not disclosed, but Levchin said: \"It is in the millions.\" Levchin aims to make Slide the leader of a new category he describes as online storytelling through multimedia, a focus that is meant to distinguish it from many photo-sharing sites. \"When the dust settles, we should be the category definer,\" he said in an interview about the site,  www.slide.com/. Growing largely through word-of-mouth recommendation, Slide ranks as the sixth-most-visited U.S. photo entertainment site, according to Web measurement firm Hitwise Inc, attracting more visitors than sites such as Snapfish and Shutterfly. In terms of visitors, it is neck and neck with Yahoo Inc.\\'s Flickr in the category, while PhotoBucket.com, a photo and video-sharing site popular among MySpace users, is No. 1. FilmLoop, which also helps users create online slideshows, is most frequently compared to Slide. But by contrast, it ranks 86th among U.S. users in Hitwise\\'s list of photo sites. Levchin founded San Francisco-based Slide as a personal pastime after selling PayPal. When he received his first round of funding in 2005 from BlueRun, also Paypal\\'s first venture backer, he began to put Slide on a business footing, he said. Vinod Khosla, one of Silicon Valley\\'s best-known venture capitalists, said in a statement he was betting on the track record of Levchin, \"who has already proven his drive, purpose and ability when he built and grew PayPal.\" Mayfield Managing Director Allen Morgan will be on Slide\\'s board of directors and Khosla will join the board of advisers. Levchin said the new money will help Slide grow by funding more staff, network capacity and faster product development. The slideshows work as a link embedded in social networking Web sites like MySpace, Facebook, Friendster, Xanga and Piczo, or as a screensaver or local desktop computer application. Slide is working on making its slideshows run on cell phones.',\n",

Cingular was talking to a lot of banks, but he did not name any potential partners or disclose whether the company had any firm commitments. \"We hope a lot of banks participate,\" he said. \"The early signs are very encouraging.\" Siegel said Cingular does not plan to charge a separate fee for the feature, which it hopes will encourage customers to sign up for data service subscriptions and potentially help Cingular win new subscribers and hold on to existing ones. Customers would be able to use the banking feature by downloading an application that Cingular is currently testing from privately held Firethorn Holdings LLC. The company and its rivals are constantly looking for new wireless data applications to boost growth amid falling phone call prices.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. proposed an $8 billion takeover of bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. on Wednesday after an attempt at merger talks failed earlier this fall. \\n\\n The combined company would have the most flights across the Atlantic Ocean of any U.S. carrier and rank No. 2 in flights to and from the Caribbean, US Airways said. It could also lead to more airline mergers and prompt other offers for Delta. \"This is not value that either of our companies can create independently,\" US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker said on a conference call. \"If we wait for Delta to emerge from bankruptcy, it will be too late.\" Delta, the No. 3 U.S. airline with over 47,000 workers, said on Wednesday it intends to emerge from bankruptcy as a stand-alone carrier. \"We received a letter from US Airways this morning and will of course review it,\" Delta CEO Gerald Grinstein said in a statement. US Airways shares rose 16.1 percent after touching $59.45, the highest since its September 2005 merger with America West. Delta shares rose 10.2 percent in afternoon trade. The news also boosted shares of other airlines, with the Amex airline index up 5.5 percent. US Airways, the No. 7 U.S. airline with over 35,000 employees, said the combination would generate at least $1.65 billion in annual savings. It expects a transaction to close by the first half of 2007. SORT OF HOSTILE \"This appears to be sort of like a hostile takeover,\" CreditSights analyst Roger King said. \"US Airways is appealing directly to the creditors.\" Under terms of the offer, Delta creditors would receive $4 billion in cash and 78.5 million shares in US Airways, with an aggregate value of about $4 billion based on Tuesday\\'s closing stock price. After a merger, Delta\\'s unsecured creditors would own about 45 percent of the combined company, US Airways said. Delta\\'s 8.3 percent bonds due in 2029 rose 20 cents on the dollar to 60.25 cents, while the yield fell to 15 percent, according to MarketAxess. Airline bonds, led by Delta, were the most actively traded bonds on Wednesday. \"There is some room to increase the consideration,\" said Clark Orsky, a bond analyst with KDP Investment Advisors. \"At least it\\'s an indication that unsecured noteholders like what they see in this offer.\" US Airways has obtained $7.2 billion in committed financing for the deal from Citigroup. Citigroup is also advising US Airways on the offer \"It will be very tempting -- it\\'s got a cash component,\" said Fruman Jacobson of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, which represented the creditors\\' committee in UAL Corp.\\'s United Airlines bankruptcy. \"It is very unusual.\" MORE OFFERS SEEN With two major U.S. carriers -- Delta and Northwest Airlines Corp. -- operating in bankruptcy and with overcapacity in the industry, analysts have been expecting consolidation and said the offer could lead other airlines to join the fray. \"My sense is that clearly US Airways is underpaying compared with what Delta might get in an open market,\" said Frank Werner, an airline finance and management expert. \"It opens up opportunities for a United, for example, to come in and top the offer.\" United and Delta together could have a more expansive reach domestically and internationally, while a combination with US Airways would have more overlap, analysts said. \"Merger synergies are much better with United,\" CreditSights\\' King said. \"This is the right time, but the wrong airline.\" Parker and UAL\\'s CEO Glenn Tilton had previously approached Delta, operating under Chapter 11 protection since September 2005, about a merger, but Grinstein was not interested. Parker broached merger talks with Delta in a September 29 letter to Grinstein. According to Parker, Grinstein had \"declined to meet or even enter into discussions.\" ANTITRUST CONCERNS The offer is likely to be closely watched by the U.S. Justice Department, experts said. \"The big concern is government regulators, if they give the green light,\" Calyon Securities Ray Neidl said. \"If they do, it will probably set off a series of potential M&A activity in the industry.\" Parker, who in 2005 orchestrated the takeover of then-bankrupt US Air by America West, has the right credentials, analysts said. Parker said he expected Delta management to ultimately see a merger as a better alternative to remaining alone. \"We need to start working with Delta to do due diligence,\" Parker told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, adding that he had not heard from the company. \"What we believe will happen is that creditors see the value of this proposal.\" \"This is just sort of the first step in a long dance,\" Kenneth Jacobs, deputy chairman and head of the U.S. operations for Lazard Freres & Co., told the Reuters Investment Banking Summit. \"There are a lot of different ways this could play out; this is kind of like the opening scene.\" In later afternoon trade, US Airways shares were up $7.31 at $58.24 on the New York Stock Exchange, and Delta shares were up 14 cents at $1.61 in over-the-counter trading. Other airline shares also rose, including Airtran Holdings Inc., up 16.08 percent; JetBlue Airways Corp. up 7.81 percent; UAL Corp. up 9.16 percent; and Southwest Airlines Co. up 4.33 percent.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters Health) - You might want to cook the holiday turkey in the oven instead of on the grill, according to results of a study released this week that found that women who favor flame-broiled foods may be at much higher risk for developing breast cancer than women who do not. \\n\\n Can\\'t give up that flame-broiled taste? Then it might be wise to take an aspirin with your char-broiled meal, as the findings also suggest that aspirin may negate the potentially harmful effects of flame-broiled foods. \"Cooking meat at high temperatures in direct heat over an open flame can lead to the production of cancer-causing chemicals known as heterocyclic amines, or HCAs,\" Dr. Kala Visvanathan from Johns Hopkins University, explained at a cancer prevention conference sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research. By studying the eating patterns of 312 women with breast cancer and 316 women who were cancer free, Visvanathan\\'s team found that breast cancer was increased a significant 74 percent in women who ate flame-broiled foods more than twice per month compared with women who never ate flame-broiled foods. \"We saw similar results for increased meat consumption\" in general, Visvanathan said. Women who ate more than 64 grams per day compared with those who ate less than or equal to 64 grams per day had a 43-percent higher risk of breast cancer. However, a woman\\'s ability to activate cancer-causing HCAs modified the risk of developing breast cancer. The NAT2 enzyme, short for N-acetyltransferase, activates HCAs, Visvanathan explained. Slow NAT2 metabolizers tend to produce less active HCAs than fast NAT2 metabolizers. Visvanathan reported that women who were \"rapid metabolizers\" of NAT2 who ate more flame-broiled food and consumed more meat daily were much more likely to develop breast cancer than slow metabolizers who never ate flame-broiled food and meat. Interestingly, in rapid NAT2 metabolizers who consumed flame-broiled food or a lot of meat, aspirin completely attenuated the increased risk of breast cancer, the researcher said. \"When we think of the biological mechanism,\" Visvanathan noted, \"there is some experimental data to explain this, but we still need to explore this further.\" Some laboratory studies have suggested that aspirin may inhibit NAT2 activity. Overall, the relationship among aspirin, flame-broiled food consumption and NAT2 activity is \"intriguing,\" Visvanathan said.',\n",

Goldman Sachs also raised its price target significantly to 110 euros from 77 euros. The DJ Stoxx European car sector index gained 1.5 percent at the same time. Volkswagen stock hit an eight-year high on Wednesday when Porsche announced it had raised its stake to 27.4 percent, aimed to raise its holding as high as 29.9 percent and planned to create authorized capital worth around 8 billion euros ($10.2 billion) as a possible acquisition currency. Porsche has said its stake aims to secure close ties with a strategic partner in case a law limiting voting rights in VW is overturned. It has ruled out so far surpassing the 30 percent threshold that would make it launch a full bid. But the market is abuzz with talk that Porsche, owned by the family of VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, could at some stage decide to take full control of Wolfsburg-based VW. Porsche\\'s decision to increase its equity capital by half was the most interesting part of Porsche\\'s earnings announcement on Wednesday, Sanford Bernstein analyst Stephen Cheetham wrote in a note to clients. \"We believe this may presage a full bid by the company for Volkswagen, fulfilling Ferdinand Piech\\'s evident wish to control the company ahead of a likely expiry of the Volkswagen law limiting any one shareholder to 20 percent of voting rights,\" he wrote. Credit Suisse acknowledged the possibility of a bid but said it continued to believe Porsche has no interest in crossing the 30 percent threshold. \"In our view, this is more posturing rather than preparation for a full bid and we still believe a holding below 30 percent satisfies Porsche\\'s medium term requirements,\" it said. MOVING OVER? Meanwhile, shares of DaimlerChrysler rose more than 3 percent on Thursday amid market talk that Wolfgang Bernhard, the restructuring expert reported to be quitting Volkswagen, could return to DaimlerChrysler, dealers said. \"There are rumors in the market that Bernhard is moving to Daimler,\" one dealer said. The stock was up 2.3 percent at 1456 GMT. Weekly Manager-Magazin reported that Volkswagen was already looking for a successor to Bernhard. DaimlerChrysler declined to comment. Last week, the VW supervisory board\\'s most influential members effectively unseated CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder in a coup that analysts widely interpreted as a power grab by Ferdinand Piech, the carmaker\\'s controversial chairman and former CEO. Piech enthroned his closest ally, Audi boss Martin Winterkorn, as new CEO in a move supported by three union representatives and the chief executive of Porsche, which is partly owned by Piech. Volkswagen\\'s supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Friday amid expectations that it will bless Winterkorn as new group chief executive, a step that analysts say would likely prompt Bernhard\\'s departure. Retaining Bernhard, a 46-year-old restructuring whiz brought to VW by Pischetsrieder, would lend considerable credibility to the group\\'s commitment to increase pretax profit to 5.1 billion euros ($6.52 billion) by 2008. If he goes, analysts expect VW stock to take a beating.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - There is no evidence antibiotics help the vast majority of patients with acute bronchitis, and doctors should stop routinely prescribing them, researchers reported on Wednesday. \\n\\n Acute bronchitis, an inflammation of the main airways to the lungs marked by an irritating cough, is one of the most common conditions treated by primary-care doctors, occurring in about 5 percent of adults each year. Two Virginia Commonwealth University doctors, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, said an exhaustive review of existing research studies and clinical trials turned up no evidence to support prescribing antibiotics for short-term bronchitis. This is because, they stated, almost all cases are viral infections and do not respond to antibiotics. They also found little evidence that cough medicine, also prescribed in most acute bronchitis cases, had any value. Dr. Richard Wenzel, chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine at VCU\\'s School of Medicine, said doctors prescribe antibiotics to 70 percent to 80 percent of patients with acute bronchitis for treatment lasting 5-10 days. Wenzel said doctors generally should send home patients with acute bronchitis empty handed. Wenzel estimated that only a few percent of acute bronchitis cases might have a bacterial cause necessitating antibiotics. Doctors say most cases will go away on their own after a few days or a week, and recommend rest and drinking lots of fluids. \\'NOT NEEDED\\' \"We think that for the most part antibiotics are not needed,\" Wenzel said in an interview. Wenzel, who wrote the paper with VCU colleague Dr. Alpha Fowler, said he had several concerns about the routine prescription of antibiotics in these cases, aside from the fact they do not help most acute bronchitis patients. Wenzel cited the cost of the many millions of pointless doses of the antibiotics as well as side effects from antibiotics such as diarrhea, gastric upset, rash, headaches and muscle aches. Wenzel said the unnecessary prescriptions also contribute to the problem of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics, thus rendering them less useful for treatment of infections. \"I hope that doctors will pause ... and spend a few minutes to say (to patients) why it\\'s unnecessary to take an antibiotic,\" Wenzel added. \"Now I know that I\\'m floating against the pressures of managed care to move people through.

DELL.O on Wednesday delayed its earnings report as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stepped up a probe into the computer maker\\'s accounting, and its shares fell nearly 3 percent. \\n\\n Dell said the delay of the earnings report, originally scheduled for Thursday, was not related to the SEC\\'s decision to elevate its investigation to formal from informal status. But the postponement reflects \"the level of complexity the company is facing in the preparation of its preliminary results,\" related to the SEC investigation and its own inquiry into accounting and financial reporting matters, Dell said. Dell plans to announce preliminary fiscal third-quarter results in a news release \"by the end of this month,\" but will not hold a conference call for analysts as it has in the past. \"The implication is that this (SEC) investigation is turning out to be more serious than what Dell anticipated and what the Street anticipated,\" said analyst Shaw Wu of American Technology Research, who has a \"neutral\" rating on the shares. Dell has disclosed few details about the accounting issues under review, saying only the SEC had asked for information \"relating to revenue recognition and other accounting and financial reporting matters for certain past fiscal years.\" The company was notified \"recently\" that the SEC had stepped up its investigation, which it started on an informal basis in August 2005, Dell spokesman Jess Blackburn said. Dell said in August that while responding to informal SEC inquiries, it came across matters that required a separate review by its board\\'s audit committee. The company, led by Chief Executive Kevin Rollins, later canceled an investor meeting in New York and said it did not know if the accounting reviews would have a material impact on its finances. Dell had said in August it did not believe the accounting issues would have a material impact. Round Rock, Texas-based Dell is also facing an inquiry by the U.S. Justice Department into its accounting. The U.S. Attorney\\'s office for the Southern District of New York subpoenaed documents related to its financial reporting from 2002 to the present, Dell said in an SEC filing in September. The SEC and Justice Department investigations indicated the \"possibility of misstatements\" in past financial reports, including \"issues relating to accruals, reserves and other balance sheet items,\" that may affect previous results, Dell said in the September filing. Dell has not yet filed second-quarter results with the SEC, pending the company\\'s internal accounting review. Dell said on Wednesday it hopes to regain compliance with SEC filing requirements \"as soon as possible.\" The earnings report delay is just the latest blow for once-high-flying Dell, which last month lost its standing as the world\\'s largest personal computer maker to Hewlett-Packard Inc. ( HPQ.N ), according to market researcher Gartner Inc. HP is stronger than Dell in the fast-growing markets of consumer PCs, notebook computers and printers, according to analysts. Most of Dell\\'s business is in corporate computers. Founded in 1984 by Michael Dell in his University of Texas dorm room, Dell has been struggling with slowing growth, the accounting investigations and a recall of Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) battery cells in its laptops after several overheated. Analysts, on average, had expected the company on Thursday to say revenue rose 4 percent to $14.5 billion, the slowest growth in nearly four years, according to Reuters Estimates. Dell shares fell 2.8 percent to $25.04 in extended trading after closing at $25.75 in regular-session trading on Nasdaq.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A crackdown on illegal use of prescription narcotics like the powerful painkiller OxyContin has caused some addicts to switch to heroin, a Justice Department report said on Wednesday. \\n\\n The report by the department\\'s National Drug Intelligence Center identified the main drug threats in the United States for the coming year. \"In some areas, such substitutions among prescription drug abusers have been widespread, creating new challenges for local law enforcement and public health agencies compelled to address a widening local heroin user population,\" it said. The study also found rates of pharmaceutical drug abuse, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants and sedatives, exceeded that of all other drugs, except marijuana. According to reports from California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, some opiate abusers in those states who began using OxyContin have progressed to heroin. Nearly 79 percent of state and local law enforcement agencies reported high or moderate availability of diverted pharmaceuticals in their area. Demand for the drugs has remained high, with use by an estimated 15,172,000 people. The report also identified a growing influence of Mexican and Asian criminal groups in drug distribution and easier availability of more potent forms of marijuana and methamphetamine. \"The production of high potency marijuana in Canada and the United States by Asian criminal groups has been a leading contributor to rising marijuana potency throughout the United States,\" the report said. It said Mexican drug traffickers have recently begun producing more potent marijuana and have expanded their control over methamphetamine distribution. The report also said cocaine availability and use in the United States has not significantly changed despite record interdictions and seizures. Southern Texas remains the leading area of entry for cocaine smuggled into the United States.',\n",
       "  ' SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Factors ranging from drought in Australia to slower exports growth in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan are set to slow economic expansion in most Asian countries in 2007, a Reuters poll shows. Still, economists say the regional slowdown will be mild, provided Asia\\'s main export markets, including the United States, maintain decent growth rates. \\n\\n Government spending on infrastructure is expected to raise incomes and consumption in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. Slower economic growth should also be accompanied by lower inflation, the poll suggests, giving central banks room to boost demand by lowering interest rates. Rob Subbaraman, regional economist at Lehman Brothers, said the 2007 outlook was unusually uncertain. \"One big risk is we see a big slowdown in exports,\" Subbaraman said. \"The other uncertainty is what happens to oil prices.\" \"But, provided there is not a sharp global economic slowdown, the region is positioned for pretty solid growth next year. \"We don\\'t see a very sharp slowdown as long as the world economy holds up, and that\\'s a big if,\" Subbaraman said. CHINA TO COOL, AT LAST? The Reuters poll of more than 100 economists in 12 countries showed economic growth will ease next year across the board with the exception of Indonesia and Thailand. Economists expect Australia\\'s growth in the year ending June 2008 to be higher than that in the year ending next June. Asia\\'s rising giant, China, will see growth in 2007 slip into single digits for the first time in five years as government efforts to dampen investment take effect, the poll says. New Zealand\\'s GDP growth is forecast at 1.8 percent in 2007 -- its lowest in at least five years -- as the economy feels the brunt of a cooling housing market and strong currency, on the back of the highest interest rates in the industrialized world. Singapore\\'s export-driven economy could see growth brake by 2.5 percentage points if U.S. demand dips, as is widely expected. Other export-reliant economies, such as those of Malaysia and Taiwan, would also see the pace of overseas sales ease. The World Bank made a similar prognosis in a report on East Asia this week. It predicted growth in East Asia excluding Japan of 7.3 percent in 2007, the slowest pace in four years. It also warned that Asia remained highly dependent on external markets despite a rise in intra-regional trade, so it was vulnerable to a severe slowdown in U.S. growth. But the World Bank reckoned, as did most economists polled by Reuters, that Asian central banks had leeway to ease monetary policy should growth slow to an unexpected degree, given that short-term rates across Asia were raised by 200 basis points between the end of 2004 and early 2006. POLICY FLEXIBILITY Besides, price pressures are abating. The Reuters poll forecast that average inflation in the Philippines would ease to 5 percent next year, from 6.5 percent estimated for 2006. Thai inflation is seen slipping to 3.3 percent next year from 4.7 percent on average expected this year. \"One important thing to note is that the region is positioned for a strong policy response if there is weakening in exports,\" Lehman\\'s Subbaraman said. \"And there is scope to expand fiscal policy, too.\" The World Bank estimated Indonesia\\'s removal of fuel subsidies last year transferred some $10 billion from consumers and businesses to government coffers, leaving it with more funds should fiscal stimulus become necessary. That doubling of fuel prices caused Indonesia\\'s inflation to jump to more than 18 percent in November 2005 and forced Bank Indonesia to push interest rates up. But Indonesia has cut rates six times this year as inflation levels declined steadily, reaching 6.29 percent in October. Benchmark U.S oil prices CLc1 have fallen more than 20 percent from July\\'s peaks above $78 a barrel. But economists believe the worry that oil will spike higher again is one reason why other central banks in Asia are reluctant to cut interest rates.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A big energy price drop pulled U.S. consumer prices down sharply in October while industrial output was weak, showing a cooling economy and easing worries over inflation. \\n\\n A fall in energy prices helped drive U.S. consumer prices down by a more-than-expected 0.5 percent in October and even stripping away volatile food and energy costs, prices were up only 0.1 percent, according to a Labor Department report on Thursday. U.S. government debt prices fell on Thursday after the latest inflation data came in weaker than expected but was still too high for investors to expect interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve any time soon. The dollar rose slightly and stocks rose for a fifth straight day on Thursday. The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average rounded off its longest winning streak since August, hitting a record intraday high of 12,325.91, before closing at a record 12,305.82. The CPI \"will be comforting for the Fed, but they\\'ll need more than one month\\'s data,\" said Steven Wieting, senior economist at Citigroup in New York. The government\\'s latest reading on prices was taken as good news by Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Michael Moskow who said inflation is indeed \"moving in the right direction,\" but it\\'s only one month\\'s data. \"It\\'s one month, and I think it\\'s a bit premature for anyone to say that we have \\'broken the back\\'\" of inflation, Moskow told reporters in Chicago. Economists in a Reuters survey were expecting overall prices to fall 0.3 percent after a 0.5 percent decline in September. Core prices in the Labor Department report were expected to rise 0.2 percent after advancing by the same amount a month earlier. Year-over-year, core consumer prices rose 2.7 percent, below economists\\' median forecast for a rise of 2.9 percent. That was a deceleration from the 2.9 percent rise posted in the 12 months through September. A separate Labor Department report showed little change in labor market conditions. The number of workers signing up for jobless benefits inched down to a seasonally adjusted 308,000 last week from 310,000 the prior week. The four-week average of these claims, which irons out weekly fluctuations, inched up to 313,750 from 311,750. On the industrial front, however, output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in October, as production of motor vehicles dropped for the second month in a row. Factory production fell 0.2 percent as output at motor vehicle plants sunk 3.9 percent last month and more than 10 percent from the same time a year ago, according to Fed data. Analysts were expecting a 0.3 percent advance in overall industrial output following a 0.6 percent drop in September. \"There does seem to be some weakness, although a lot of it is related to autos; but even outside autos, manufacturing doesn\\'t look too strong,\" said David Sloan, senior economist at 4Cast Ltd. in New York. Another survey of manufacturing showed a rebound in activity in the Mid-Atlantic region during November. According to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, business at factories in that region rebounded in November after contracting for the past two months, in line with Wall Street expectations. However, an index for new orders in that report, which is seen as a key gauge of future growth, fell and the six-month business outlook slipped. ENERGY PRICES FALL In October, energy prices were down 7 percent. For the year to date they were down a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.5 percent after surging 17.1 percent last year. Food and beverage prices were up 0.3 percent in October after gaining 0.4 percent in September. Prices for education and medical care continued to rise last month, while housing prices remained unchanged. Signs of milder U.S. inflation reaffirmed Wall Street\\'s views the Fed will remain on hold for some time, a Reuters poll of primary dealers showed on Thursday. All 19 respondents expect the central bank to keep benchmark interest rates steady at the next rate-setting meeting on December 12. Twelve of the 19 respondents expect the Fed to ease next year. In contrast, seven of those polled see the Fed tightening. \"We have seen evidence that the economy is softening and with that softening we are seeing a cooling in inflation as well,\" David Coard, head of fixed income sales and trading at Williams Capital Group in New York.

       "  ' HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Former Enron chief accounting officer Richard Causey was sentenced on Wednesday to five and one-half years in prison for approving the bogus bookkeeping that led to the company\\'s 2001 collapse. \\n\\n Causey, 46, the last of the top-tier Enron executives to be sentenced, pleaded guilty to securities fraud in December 2005, weeks before he was scheduled to go on trial with former Enron chief executives Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, both of whom were found guilty in May. Lay died of a heart attack July 5. \"Improper things were done at Enron,\" Causey told U.S. District Judge Sim Lake at his sentencing hearing. \"Some things were done by me and for that I am profoundly sorry.\" Causey, who faced more than 20 years in prison if convicted on three dozen original charges, agreed to a maximum sentence of seven years in jail and forfeit $1.25 million under a plea deal. Causey was a key figure in the financial scandal that followed disclosures the company used off-the-books partnership deals to hide billions of dollars in debt and to inflate profits. Financial scandals at Enron, WorldCom and Tyco led to tighter financial reporting disclosure standards for all U.S companies and increased accountability for top executives. Enron\\'s demise as the largest U.S. energy trader contributed to a severe contraction of the entire U.S. electricity trading industry and accelerated a move away from competitive markets for electricity in several states. After joining Enron from accounting firm Arthur Andersen in 1991, Causey worked closely with Lay, Skilling and former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. In his plea, Causey admitted to conspiring with other Enron senior managers to mislead investors about the company\\'s finances in order to inflate Enron\\'s stock price. In early 2000, Enron recorded $85 million in earnings from an interest it held in a partnership called JEDI, which held Enron stock, Causey said in his plea deal. The $85 million was reported as operating earnings when the increase came directly from a rise in Enron\\'s stock price following a January 20 analyst call, Causey said. Fastow, who pleaded guilty and is serving a six year-prison sentence, testified against Lay and Skilling. Causey did not testify against them. Skilling was sentenced in October to 24 years in jail but has said he would appeal. Sentences handed down so far for the 16 Enron employees who have pleaded guilty have ranged from probation to 24 years for Skilling. Causey will begin his prison sentence after the U.S. Bureau of Prisons determines where he will be housed. He left the courthouse with his wife and three teen-age children without commenting to reporters. Two more ex-Enron executives, who pleaded guilty, will learn their fate on Friday.

       "  ' (Reuters) - Following are the main points in the regulations, announced by the government on Thursday, that will govern the operations of foreign banks in China from December 11. \\n\\n SCOPE OF BUSINESS -- Unlike a locally registered bank, a non-incorporated foreign bank branch may not engage in bank card business or take deposits from Chinese residents smaller than 1 million yuan. -- All banks may grant loans; handle acceptances; provide letters of credit; and buy and sell bonds as well as foreign-currency securities other than stocks. -- All banks may act as agents for insurance companies; engage in interbank lending; provide safe deposit boxes; and offer credit information and consultancy services. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS -- A foreign-funded or Chinese-foreign joint venture bank registering locally must have paid-in capital of 1 billion yuan plus 100 million yuan in operating capital per branch. -- Capital allocated to the branches may not exceed 60 percent of the parent bank\\'s aggregate capital. -- A branch of an overseas bank that does not incorporate locally must have non-callable capital of 200 million yuan, 30 percent of which must be in the form of interest-bearing assets. -- Such a branch\\'s operating capital plus reserves must be at least 8 percent of its risk assets, a ratio that regulators may increase if they identify high risk assets and weak risk management. -- To ensure liquidity, a foreign bank branch\\'s ratio of current assets to current liabilities must be at least 25 percent. OTHER REQUIREMENTS -- Foreign banks must have $10 billion in assets if they register locally and $20 billion if they do not. -- They must have been profitable for two consecutive years and have been open for business in China for at least three years prior to applying for a license. -- They must meet capital adequacy requirements and have effective anti-money laundering systems. -- Bank supervisors in their home country must have approved their China application and have in place a well established cooperation mechanism with China\\'s bank supervisors. APPROVAL TIMETABLE -- China\\'s bank regulator must decide on a foreign bank\\'s application within six months, extendable for another three months. -- Upon approval, the foreign bank has six months to prepare to set up its operations, extendable to nine months; if it fails to do so in time, the approval lapses. -- If it passes the preparation inspection, the foreign bank then applies to commence business; the regulator must rule within two months of receiving the application. OTHER PROVISIONS -- Senior executives of an incorporated foreign bank shall not hold concurrent positions at bank\\'s branch engaging in wholesale foreign currency business, and vice versa. -- Transactions between the incorporated foreign bank and its wholesale forex branch \"shall be based on market terms and shall not be more favorable than the terms of the transactions between either entity and its non-related parties\".',\n",
       "  ' BEIJING  (Reuters) - Revised rules governing foreign lenders mark a milestone as China opens its financial sector, but they are unlikely to lead to dramatic inroads by overseas banks. \\n\\n China\\'s cabinet and banking regulator said on Thursday that the rules showed Beijing was honoring commitments made when it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 and would create an environment in which foreign lenders could thrive. \"We believe that with China\\'s ongoing development and improved financial supervision, foreign banks will have broader scope in which to develop,\" Song Dahan, vice-minister of the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, told a news conference. From December 11, the end of a five-year transitional period for China to implement its WTO promises, foreign banks will have to choose whether to incorporate as local entities. If they do so, by stumping up 1 billion yuan ($127 million) in capital, they will gain full access to China\\'s retail banking market, including some $2 trillion in household deposits, and can issue bank cards. If they do not, they will not be allowed to take deposits of less than 1 million yuan and may not engage in bank card business. They will also have to set aside twice as much capital, 200 million yuan per branch, as locally registered lenders. Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) ( 2888.HK ) was first out of the starting gate, announcing on Thursday that it had applied to establish a locally incorporated subsidiary. HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) has said it will do the same. But only a handful of other global lenders is likely to take on the huge challenge of competing with domestic banks head on. Even if U.S. financial giant Citigroup ( C.N ) secures operational control of Guangdong Development Bank, which has 500 branches, its venture would be dwarfed by China\\'s big state banks, which have tens of thousands of outlets each. Many smaller Western banks are likely to opt instead to serve customers mainly from home or to take minority stakes in local lenders to tap their well-established distribution networks. \"I don\\'t think this is opening the floodgates by any means,\" said Charlene Chu, a bank analyst for Fitch Ratings in Beijing. Foreign banks had $105 billion worth of assets in China at the end of September, but that was just 1.9 percent of the total. \"I think that when we look from a branch network perspective, domestic banks are vastly ahead of foreign banks and will continue to be so,\" Chu said. NO DISCRIMINATION Draft rules that circulated in August raised fears among some Western bankers that higher capital requirements might make it more difficult to do business in China. But the Chinese officials said the rules were the same for Chinese banks and made supervisory sense. Beijing\\'s rulebook draws heavily on the experience of other regulators -- a point made by HSBC, which said it had complied with local incorporation requirements in a number of countries. Having consulted with foreign banks, officials said Beijing would allow foreign lenders that incorporate to keep enjoying lower taxes than their Chinese peers until foreign and domestic tax rates are harmonized, a step expected in 2007 or 2008. The revisions also give foreign lenders planning to set up locally a grace period so they can meet prescribed asset/liability ratios. Still, Western bankers worry that Beijing will apply the rules in a way that slows the expansion of foreign lenders, at least until China has finally cleansed the big domestic banks of non-performing loans so they are strong enough to compete. \"The NPL problem is not yet solved. So, as long as they have this problem, they will be afraid that foreign banks will run over Chinese lenders,\" one Western banker in Beijing said. Chinese officials said they would not drag their feet. The cabinet statement said the bank regulator would rule on an incorporation application within 6 months. \"Approvals are also one of those things where they could be quite liberal to begin with,\" said Fitch\\'s Chu. \"But if they were to start seeing problems down the road, that would be one area that they could fairly easily tighten up on.\" (Additional reporting by  Eadie Chen )',\n",
       "  ' HONG KONG  (Reuters) - A Citigroup-led investment team won a 24.3 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) bid for control of China\\'s Guangdong Development Bank, beating out a group led by France\\'s Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) and giving the U.S. bank a bigger foothold in the fast-growing Chinese market. \\n\\n After a year-and-a-half long bidding process, the Citigroup ( C.N ) team won an 85.6 percent stake in a middle-tier bank with billions of dollars of nonperforming loans on its books but which has more than 500 branches and a presence in Guangdong, China\\'s richest province. \"You could say Citigroup is trying to take a bad house in a good neighborhood and fix it up,\" said John Augustine, chief investment strategist at Fifth Third Asset Management, which owns 2.6 million Citigroup shares. Banks globally are scrambling to do business in China, whose economy has turned in double-digit growth every year for the last five years. Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) and Allianz ( ALVG.DE ) have all booked fat profits from stakes in China\\'s three biggest state-run lenders, which have just finished an IPO spree worth more than $42 billion. Citigroup will own 20 percent of Guangdong Development Bank while U.S. technology services company IBM ( IBM.N ) will own 4.74 percent. The remaining members of the consortium, all of which are Chinese, will own 60.85 percent. Citigroup is expected to have de facto control of the bank, but a source said that decision will not be determined definitively until after the sale closes. Control is a sensitive issue, with China Life Insurance Co. ( 2628.HK ) ( LFC.N ) and China\\'s State Grid Corp. each taking 20 percent stakes in the bank. China\\'s CITIC Investment and Puhua Investment will respectively take 12.85 and 8 percent stakes. Guangdong Development Bank said it will work with Citigroup on eight areas including risk management, corporate governance, asset and debt management, human resources and financial innovation. GDB had more than $6 billion in bad debts at the end of last year, according to sources, which makes for a nonperforming loan ratio of 25 percent, versus a country average of 8 percent. OPENING UP Citigroup\\'s deal comes a day after Beijing released rules for the full opening of its banking sector next month as required by the World Trade Organization. China, where individuals hold roughly $2 trillion in savings, will allow Citigroup and rivals like HSBC Holdings ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) to incorporate locally and conduct yuan-currency business with Chinese retail customers for the first time. Citigroup is also negotiating to increase its stake in Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ( 600000.SS ) to 20 percent from less than 5 percent, which would give it a sizable presence in two of China\\'s wealthiest business hubs. Citigroup has focused on smaller banks rather than taking small stakes in state-controlled behemoths after it missed a chance to invest in No. 3 mainland lender China Construction Bank ( 0939.HK ), which sold a 9 percent share to Bank of America last year for $3 billion. Citigroup initially sought to buy 40 percent of GDB in a move that would have circumvented rules capping individual foreign stakes in mainland lenders at 20 percent. Chinese banks are also prohibited from being more than 25 percent foreign-owned. Citigroup and SocGen resubmitted scaled-down bids at the government\\'s request in June. SocGen had teamed up with Baoshan Iron and Steel Co. ( 600019.SS ) and oil refiner Sinopec Corp. ( 0386.HK ). Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) advised GDB during the process.

       "  ' SEOUL  (Reuters) - A South Korean court issued warrants to detain two senior executives of U.S. private equity fund Lone Star LS.UL, the latest twist in a nine-month probe that is likely to delay the country\\'s second-biggest takeover. \\n\\n The court ruling came a day after the Supreme Prosecutors\\' Office submitted its third request in two weeks to detain Ellis Short, vice chairman of Lone Star, and Michael Thomson, its general counsel. Prosecutors have been looking into allegations, raised by politicians, that financial data on Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) 004940.KS had been understated to help Lone Star buy the bank in 2003 at a bargain price of $1.2 billion. They also suspect KEB top management of artificially pushing down the share price of a credit card affiliate it bought out in early 2004 and damaging shareholders. The legal wrangling has been a key factor in delaying Lone Star\\'s plan to sell the country\\'s No. 5 lender to top bank Kookmin Bank 060000.KS for $7.3 billion. It also has made investors grow wary of anti-foreign sentiment in South Korea. Prosecutors want to see whether Lone Star was involved, while both KEB and Lone Star have denied wrongdoing. \"The KEB situation represents the final phase of the bank reorganizations that took place during the (1997-98) financial crisis,\" said Ku Yong-uk, an analyst at Daewoo Securities. \"Now that the risk is over, people are wondering why companies like KEB were sold and bought at such a low price.\" Lone Star\\'s planned sale of KEB to Kookmin would rank as the country\\'s second-largest takeover, after No. 2 Shinhan Financial Group\\'s ( 055550.KS ) agreed purchase of LG Card Co. 032710.KS for $7.5 billion. Prosecutors have been unable to find evidence of wrongdoing in the 2003 sale to convict those involved, while the government may not want to face the deal\\'s collapse. THIRD GO-ROUND The Seoul Central District Court had turned down earlier detention requests on grounds the Lone Star executives were not likely to flee or destroy evidence. But the prosecutors\\' office this time pushed harder to detain U.S.-based Short and Thomson after they refused to come to South Korea for questioning. \"Last time, they didn\\'t mention any extradition plans,\" judge Lee Hyo-jae said by telephone, asked why the court issued the warrants this time. Washington and Seoul have an extradition treaty but it tends to take several months to receive U.S. court approval to exercise warrants against U.S. citizens. Lone Star took issue with the prosecutors. \"We have offered repeatedly to come to Korea for questioning, as long as we are allowed to leave. We remain willing to cooperate fully with the Prosecutors\\' investigation if they abide by international standards of justice,\" Short said in a statement. Short, 46-year-old graduate of the University of Missouri, worked for GE Capital, General Electric\\'s ( GE.N ) financial arm, between 1983 and 1993. The right-hand man to Lone Star Chairman John Grayken handled the fund\\'s acquisition of Tokyo Star Bank Ltd. 8384.T for 40 billion yen in 2001. Short was last in Seoul in October to negotiate with Kookmin to keep the KEB deal on track. Thomson visited the prosecutors\\' office for questioning in October when prosecutors guaranteed his return home, according to Lone Star. Prosecutors said the United States would review their request, said prosecutors\\' spokesman Kang Chan-woo. \"We had sent requests to them to come to receive questioning six times,\" prosecutor Kang added. \"But they told us to come and conduct questioning in the United States.\" The maximum penalties for the charges faced by the two are a 10-year prison term or a 20 million won ($21,250) fine, a court source said. The court also rejected a fourth request to arrest Paul Yoo, the head of a South Korean unit of Lone Star, on allegations of improper stock trading and tax evasion. Kookmin shares ended down 1.99 percent to 73,800 won while KEB shares lost 0.41 percent. (Additional reporting by Marie-France Han)',\n",

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Milton Friedman, one of the most influential economists of the past century and a champion of free markets, died on Thursday morning of heart failure at age 94, a family spokeswoman said. \\n\\n The winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize for economics, Friedman preached free enterprise in the face of government regulation and advocated a monetary policy involving steady growth in money supply, ideas that played pivotal roles in the governing philosophies of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. \"Milton Friedman revived the economics of liberty, when it had been all but forgotten,\" Thatcher said in a statement. \"He was an intellectual freedom fighter. Never was there a less dismal practitioner of \\'the dismal science\\' (economics).\" \"If you had to ask people across the world to name an economist, by far his name would be the most common,\" Gary Becker, who won the 1992 Nobel Prize for economics, told Reuters. \"He could express the most complicated economic ideas in the most simple language.\" Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a statement the \"direct and indirect influences of his thinking on contemporary monetary economics would be difficult to overstate. Just as important, in his humane and engaging way, Milton conveyed to millions an understanding of the economic benefits of free, competitive markets, as well as the close connection that economic freedoms bear to other types of liberty.\" Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan added: \"He had been a fixture in my life both professionally and personally for a half century. My world will not be the same.\" INFLUENCED REAGAN St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole said much of modern central bank thinking stemmed from Friedman\\'s work and his most important contribution was to bring theoretical economic thinking to bear on public policy issues. \"You look at what Reagan did, it was what Milton had been advocating for a long time,\" said Martin Anderson, a Hoover Institution fellow and domestic and economic policy adviser to the Republican Reagan. \"What Milton did was to confirm what he (Reagan) thought and make it more confident, and that became \\'Reaganomics.\\'\" While Friedman found favor among conservatives, he was most interested in obtaining practical results by tapping markets, said Robert Reich, a labor secretary in the Democratic Clinton administration. \"He was more experimental than doctrinaire.\" Ken Livingstone, London\\'s left-wing mayor, credited Friedman for inspiring his flagship \"congestion charge\" policy to reduce traffic by charging drivers for entering the city\\'s center. \"The biggest effect Milton Friedman had was making inflation unacceptable,\" said Tom Campbell, a graduate student under Friedman and dean of the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. \"We don\\'t talk about the risk of inflation in the 10, 12, 20 percent range anymore because people won\\'t stand for it.\" CONTROVERSIAL In 1976, Friedman\\'s years of teaching and nearly two dozen books were recognized with the Nobel Prize for economic science. Friedman, however, was not without controversy. His work was not initially popular, emerging at a time when government spending and intervention were widely credited with helping end the worldwide depression of the 1930s. His Nobel ceremony in Stockholm prompted a large turnout of demonstrators who criticized him for economic advice he provided the government of Augusto Pinochet, who led Chile\\'s 17-year dictatorship in which some 3,000 leftists were killed. \"He tried not to let the political composition of the government interfere with things he thought would be better for the people in the country,\" said Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, Friedman raised his profile further as a columnist and contributing editor for Newsweek magazine and through frequent television appearances. In a retrospective on his work, the Brooklyn-born Friedman traced his roots and those of the so-called Chicago school of economics back to 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith. He moved to California in 1977, when he became a senior research fellow at Stanford University\\'s Hoover Institution. (Additional reporting by  Alister Bull  in Washington)',\n",
       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Milton Friedman became a towering figure in modern-day economics, a Nobel Prize winner whose view that controlling the money supply was the key to economic health became a central plank of economic theory. \\n\\n Friedman, who died on Thursday of heart failure at a hospital in the San Francisco area at age 94, was regarded as one of the most influential conservative thinkers that America and the famed Chicago school of economics ever produced. \"Before Milton, economists were not taken seriously by public policy-makers,\" St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole told reporters at a Cato Institute conference in Washington, where participants stood silently for a moment in memory. Poole cited the influence Friedman\\'s research had on policy issues as varied as U.S. military conscription, school vouchers and tax policy, in addition to his more popular work on the link between the money supply and inflation. \"He was an extraordinarily important figure in the profession,\" Poole said. Economic historian Anna Schwartz, who was at the Cato conference when Friedman\\'s death became public, praised her long-time collaborator as a teacher who \"did so much to make monetary policy a central issue for policy makers.\" Friedman\\'s line of thought was not always popular theory, emerging as it did when  public spending was still credited with helping end the worldwide depression of the 1930s. The Brooklyn-born Friedman instead preached free enterprise in the face of government regulation -- a theory championed politically by the late U.S. President Ronald Reagan and by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- and advocated a monetary policy calling for steady growth in money supplies. He once summed his \"monetarism\" this way: \"Our attitude has been that the important thing about monetary policy is what happens to the quantity of money and not what happens to interest rates; that changes in the quantity of money have played an important role in producing inflation, depressions and recessions. \"The appropriate policy for a country to adopt is a steady rate of increase in the quantity of money,\" he said. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO DAYS Friedman was a student and long-time professor at the University of Chicago as part of the school\\'s influential circle of economists. He was doing post-graduate work at the university in 1933 when Franklin Roosevelt brought the philosophy of British economist John Maynard Keynes into the White House. The ensuing emphasis on using government as a tax-spend tool to regulate and engineer the economy held sway in much of the world for decades, until it began falling from favor toward the end of the 1960s under a critique spearheaded by Friedman. \"For close to three decades he was a voice in the wilderness, trying to explain to the rest of the profession that monetary economics was alive, relevant and important,\" University of Chicago colleague Arnold Harberger once said. Friedman said keeping the economy on an even keel was not possible if it was operated like a thermostat -- turning spending off and on -- because of the lags between policy changes and their ultimate impact. Instead, a steady and predictable monetary policy was the surest guarantee against excessive fluctuations in prices and the level of economic activity, Friedman believed. In 1976, Friedman\\'s teaching and nearly two-dozen books were recognized with the Nobel Prize for economic science. However, he also came under fire in the 1970s for advising Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. As a columnist and contributing editor for Newsweek magazine and through frequent television appearances, Friedman became one of the country\\'s most visible economists. In a retrospective on his work, Friedman traced his roots and those of the Chicago school of thought that he led back to Adam Smith. He moved his base of operations to California in 1977, when he became a senior research fellow at Stanford University\\'s Hoover Institution. \"The key to the influence of the University of Chicago on economics throughout the world,\" Friedman said, \"is that ever since it was founded in 1892, the Economics Department of the University of Chicago has regarded economics as a serious subject that has something to do with the real world. \"Anybody who sets out to understand the world as it is ... is inevitably driven to recognize the defects of governmental intervention into markets.\"',\n",
       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) reported on Thursday a quadrupling of net profit as the computing and printing company\\'s sales and margins improved across its key divisions. \\n\\n The results were helped by the absence of last year\\'s charge of more than $1 billion for job cuts, and profit before items handily topped analysts\\' forecasts. HP shares rose only slightly as analysts said they appeared richly valued after rising more than 40 percent this year. HP has in recent months endured the embarrassing disclosure of its investigation into board leaks to the media, which spurred the collection of phone records of directors, a few HP workers and reporters. The scandal ultimately claimed HP Chairman Patricia Dunn, who has since resigned as a director. But the business itself remains in good shape. Operating profit margins in all its major businesses -- PCs, printers, servers and storage, services and software -- all widened from a year ago as HP continued to cut costs and boost sales. \"What a difference a year makes. Last year, HP was a dog and Dell was a darling,\" said Shawn Campbell, principal at Campbell Asset Management, which owns HP shares. \"It\\'s a solid quarter across all the business segments.\" Last quarter, HP recaptured the worldwide lead in PC shipments from longtime rival Dell Inc. DELL.O for the first time since the end of 2003. Dell has been struggling with weak results and the biggest electronics recall in U.S. history. \"The surprise was that their PC business and their imaging business did better than expected,\" said American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu. Net income for its fiscal fourth quarter to October 31 rose to $1.7 billion, or 60 cents per share, from $416 million, or 14 cents per share. Revenue climbed 7 percent to $24.6 billion. Excluding items, HP said it had a profit of 68 cents per share. Analysts had expected the Palo Alto, California-based company to earn 64 cents per share before items, on average, on revenue of $24.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. GUIDANCE GOOD For the current quarter, HP expects earnings per share, including stock-based compensation, of 60 cents to 62 cents before items, including 5 cents for amortization of purchased intangible assets. HP expects revenue this quarter of $24.1 billion to $24.3 billion. Analysts had expected HP, led by Chief Executive Mark Hurd, to earn 60 cents per share, on average, on revenue of $23.9 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2007. \"The guidance looks pretty good,\" Wu said. \"I think though their guidance is pretty conservative, which is typical Mark Hurd fashion.\" HP said fourth-quarter revenue in its lucrative imaging and printing group rose 7 percent to $7.3 billion, and operating profit was 14.8 percent of revenue, up from 13.2 percent a year earlier. HP is the world\\'s biggest maker of computer printers. In enterprise storage and servers, a business that has rebounded recently, revenue climbed 4 percent to $4.7 billion and operating margin widened to 10.7 percent from 9 percent. Revenue in HP\\'s software unit climbed 14 percent to $349 million as its operating margin was 17.2 percent. Revenue in its computer services businesses rose 5 percent to $4.1 billion, and operating margin was 12.4 percent. Hurd said in a conference call with reporters that HP had completed nearly all the 15,300 job cuts announced in July. Due to the board leak scandal, HP has a number of vacancies on its board, and Hurd said it was working to fill them. \"We\\'re working on it,\" Hurd said on the call. \"Hopefully you\\'ll see us take action in an appropriate time frame.\" HP shares rose to $40.35 in extended trading after closing up 0.9 percent at $40.13 in regular-session trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of HP have surged 40 percent this year, compared with a 14 percent decline in those of Dell.

One investor said that Starbucks benefited from a lower tax rate. \"The quality wasn\\'t quite as good as I believe the Street would have liked to see,\" said Don Gher, chief investment officer for Bellevue, Washington-based Coldstream Capital Management, who owns Starbucks shares. Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter ended October 1 was $117.3 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with $123.7 million, or 16 cents per share, a year ago. Starbucks said that results in the latest period included the impact of expensing stock compensation, which reduced earnings by 2 cents per share, and a requirement which addresses asset retirement obligations, which cut another 2 cents per share from earnings. Excluding the impact of FIN 47, which addresses asset retirement obligations, Starbucks said that it earned $135 million, or 17 cents per share. On that basis, the results met analysts\\' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. But the effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.2 percent, down from 38.1 percent a year earlier. \"The tax rate probably added a penny or so to the earnings,\" Gher said. Total revenue jumped 20.7 percent to $2.003 billion, but fell short of Wall Street\\'s average forecast of $2.01 billion. Revenue from company-operated retail shops rose 22 percent to $1.7 billion, aided by new stores. Sales at stores open at least 13 months, a key measure that is closely watched on Wall Street, rose 5 percent. Shares of Starbucks fell 5.7 percent to $37.20 in extended trade. The shares closed at $39.43 on Nasdaq after rising to a high of $40.01. The company said it still expects to open about 2,400 net new stores this year, post total net revenue growth of about 20 percent and comparable store sales growth of 3 percent to 7 percent. Starbucks also still expects to earn 87 cents to 89 per share this year. Analysts had expected a profit of 89 cents per share.

The blue-chip Dow average achieved its longest winning streak since August as investors snapped up shares of industrial companies such as Boeing Co. ( BA.N ). The S&P 500 jumped to a six-year intraday peak at 1,403.76 and the Nasdaq climbed to 2,453.35, its highest since February 2001. For the Nasdaq, this marked its longest series of gains since September. Before the opening bell, the government reported that the overall U.S. Consumer Price Index dropped much more than expected and the core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose just 0.1 percent -- or half the gain that Wall Street expected. \"The CPI number is supportive of the idea that there will be very little pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and it would probably allow them to begin lowering rates at some point next year,\" said Michael Malone, trading analyst at Cowen & Co. in New York. \"The crude drop removes inflationary pressures on the economy and also contributes to consumer confidence. The combination of those two things is good, particularly as we go into the holiday season. It bodes well for the economy.\" The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 54.11 points, or 0.44 percent, to end at a record 12,305.82. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  gained 3.19 points, or 0.23 percent, to finish at 1,399.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  added 6.31 points, or 0.26 percent, to close at 2,449.06. Oil tumbled 4.3 percent to its lowest point in almost a year as dealers focused on swelling U.S. crude stockpiles and forecasts of a mild winter in the world\\'s top oil-consuming nation, the United States. U.S. crude for December delivery CLZ6 fell $2.50 to settle on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $56.26 a barrel, the lowest settlement since November 18, 2005. A cut in interest rates would help lower corporate borrowing costs, bolstering prospects for a continued rise in earnings. After the bell, shares of Hewlett-Packard Co.

Hewlett-Packard shares ended regular trading at $40.16, up almost 1 percent, or 37 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. During the regular session, Boeing Co.

Boeing shares shot up 1.9 percent, or $1.63, to finish at $88.71 on the NYSE. The drop in crude, however, hurt shares of energy heavyweights, including Exxon Mobil Corp.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), the No. 1 U.S. radio station operator, said on Thursday it had agreed to be taken private in a $18.7 billion buyout by the founding family and equity firms Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL and Bain Capital Partners LLC. \\n\\n Clear Channel, which also said it plans to divest 448 of its 1,150 radio stations, is selling at a time when the radio advertising market is weak, and listeners are migrating to digital music, Internet media and satellite radio. The Mays family, which includes Mark, Randall and founder Lowry Mays, is participating in the buyout, but the financial details were not immediately available. Mark Mays will continue as chief executive, and Randall will be president and chief financial officer. Chairman Lowry Mays will continue in an active role, the company said. The private equity firms, which have also pursued other large media properties this year, agreed to buy Clear Channel for $37.60 a share, a 16 percent premium to the $32.35 closing share price on October 25, when the company said it was looking at strategic alternatives. Bain and Thomas H. Lee will be equal investors in Clear Channel. The company said no significant layoffs are expected. Clear Channel shares closed up 3.6 percent at $35.36 on the New York Stock Exchange. COMPETING BIDS Two teams of private equity bidders had submitted offers, sources told Reuters. The other consortium included Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone Group BG.UL and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL. Blackstone declined to comment. KKR and Providence were not immediately available. Clear Channel can still solicit competing bids from third parties through December 7, and then negotiate until January 5. If the company accepts a superior proposal, it would be required to pay a break-up fee to Bain and Thomas H. Lee. Some analysts said they doubted a competing offer would emerge since the auction had been well-publicized and only attracted two bidding groups. \"The price is compelling enough for shareholders to likely conclude that an outright sale of the company is likely to unlock as much value as any other alternative, such as a restructuring,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst David Bank. \"The only thing that can be a concern is that Thomas Lee is involved in a lot of other media properties so closing could take longer than expected. I can\\'t imagine that they didn\\'t vet this with regulators though,\" Bank said. Thomas H. Lee was part of a group that agreed to buy Univision Communications Inc. UVN.N in September for more than $12 billion. \"We should expect some bumps along the way, but we don\\'t expect it (regulatory scrutiny) to block the deal,\" said Jerry Paul, portfolio manager with QCM Absolute Return Fund. The radio stations earmarked to be sold are located outside the Top 100 U.S. media markets. Also to be sold is Clear Channel\\'s 42-station television station group. \"You might see them have to divest some stations from other big-city markets\" to win approval from regulators, said Paul, whose fund owns shares of Clear Channel. The planned divestitures do not depend on the larger buyout going through. The company already has received unsolicited interest for those assets, sources familiar with the situation said. Debt-rating agencies Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor\\'s cut Clear Channel\\'s credit ratings to junk following news of the deal. \"Although the company has not announced specific financing terms of the new capital structure, we would expect a marked increase in leverage, which is likely to result in even further ratings downside potential,\" S&P said in statement. OUTDOOR BUSINESS DRAWS INTEREST Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. analyst Kit Spring said the deal values Clear Channel at 11.3-times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), which is below smaller but similar radio deals that fetched prices of 13-times  EBITDA. \"We believe shareholders should reject the initial offer,\" Spring said. Clear Channel\\'s \"assets could command a much higher price if sold piece by piece.\" Clear Channel also owns a majority stake in outdoor advertising group Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. ( CCO.N ). The deal does not include a provision for taking Clear Channel Outdoor private or selling it to another buyer. French outdoor advertising company JCDecaux ( JCDX.PA ) said on Thursday it was interested in buying Clear Channel Outdoor, adding that private equity firms were aware of its interest. \"It won\\'t be a cheap deal,\" JCDecaux co-Chief Executive Jean-Charles Decaux said during an investor conference. \"But we think we are quite a natural buyer for most of the assets if they are for sale.\" Clear Channel said its board of directors, excluding those with an interest in the buyout, and a special board advisory committee made up of disinterested directors backed the deal. The company said the three Mays family members had agreed to reduced payments related to change of control clauses in their employment agreements.

In the publishing industry alone, Tribune Co. TRB.N is weighing at least three private equity bids, or a possible sale of newspapers on an individual basis. Private investors have also acquired newspapers, including the Philadelphia Inquirer, from corporate owners. Reader\\'s Digest, best known for its namesake magazine and its newer Every Day with Rachael Ray, has faced the same types of problems that are hurting many peers in publishing, from long-standing declines in circulation to heavy competition for advertising dollars from new media. Last month, the company posted a quarterly loss of $26.7 million. Including assumed debt, the investor group\\'s purchase is worth $2.4 billion and is expected to close in early 2007. MAKEOVER LITTLE HELP Published in 21 languages, Reader\\'s Digest magazine has a monthly circulation of about 18 million and an estimated 80 million readers worldwide. But it has suffered from the perception that its appeal is limited to an older demographic than the 18-to-49-year-olds whom advertisers covet. The company itself has tried in recent years to win over investors with a redesign of its flagship magazine, the introduction of new publications, and cost cutting that included layoffs and the sale of its headquarters. \"The basic strategy is to improve operating efficiencies, optimize cost structure and supply chain, and drive the revenue growth,\" Robert Berner III, managing director at Ripplewood, said in an interview. \"This company has great brands, great assets, but it\\'s a little bit misunderstood,\" he said, adding that Reader\\'s Digest magazine is only a small portion of the company\\'s North American revenues. Indeed, Reader\\'s Digest, founded by DeWitt and Lila Wallace out of their Greenwich Village apartment in 1922, now publishes 20 other magazines, including cooking magazine Taste of Home. It also publishes books and markets collections of music. Ripplewood already has investments in Direct Holdings Worldwide and WRC Media, which publishes educational materials such as World Almanac.

The new bid comes less than a week before Reckson shareholders are scheduled to vote on a cash-and-stock offer worth roughly $4 billion from SL Green Realty Corp. The vote is set for November 22 but could be delayed by the Icahn/Macklowe bid. The SL Green deal calls for a group led by Reckson Chief Executive Officer Scott Rechler to buy most of the company\\'s suburban holdings for $2.1 billion after the deal closes. A group of Reckson shareholders led by Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder Advisers LLC opposes the SL Green deal, saying it undervalues the suburban properties. Arnhold controls about 1 percent of Reckson. Icahn, referring to the proposed sale of Reckson\\'s suburban holdings, told Reuters. \"I think this deal is undervalued.\" The offer is subject to due diligence but not to financing, Icahn said. Icahn declined to disclose if he owns Reckson shares. After purchasing large stakes in companies, investors have 10 days to file with U.S. securities regulators disclosing ownership above 5 percent. SL Green said it would continue to work toward the scheduled Reckson shareholder vote on November 22. Approval requires least two-thirds of Reckson shareholders to vote in favor of the deal. \"While the company has been advised of another offer, we have doubts that it is a credible bid,\" SL Green said in a statement. \"The proposal is from a group that has not had access to any non-public information and has conditioned its offer on due diligence.\" On the other hand, SL Green has been through Reckson\\'s books and said, \"there are substantial incremental transaction costs that they have likely not considered.\\' In addition, SL Green said the rival bid does not show that the rival bidder has the committed and unconditional financing for a transaction valued in excess of $6.5 billion. Reckson has $2 billion of debt that would be assumed by any buyer. Icahn typically takes large positions in a company and agitates for change. In the real estate arena, he owns more than 86 percent of American Real Estate Partners LP, which owns rental, hotel and casino properties, according to the company\\'s 2005 proxy statement. Macklowe, lead by Harry Macklowe, is one of the largest owners and developers of New York properties. His portfolio includes the GM building on Fifth Avenue, which commands some of the highest office rents in Manhattan. Shares of Reckson rose $2.96, or 6.6 percent, to $48.02 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. SL Green shares were off 92 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $126. Bank of America analyst Ross Nussbaum said a heated bidding war was unlikely. \"SL Green has previously been a disciplined buyer,\" he wrote in a research note. \"Putting a higher number on the table would impact management credibility, in our view.\" SL Green\\'s offer was $1 to $2 per share below what Reckson could be expected to fetch, Nussbaum said. Topping the Icahn/Macklowe offer would mean diluting SL Green\\'s funds from operations, a measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts, by as much as 20 cents per share in 2007, Nussbaum said. Prior to the Icahn/Macklowe offer, shareholder advisory services -- including Institutional Shareholder Services; Glass, Lewis & Co., and Proxy Governance Inc. -- came out in favor of the SL Green deal.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, parent of Macy\\'s and Bloomingdale\\'s, said on Thursday that it will cut jobs and close three distribution centers early next year to reduce excess capacity. \\n\\n The department store operator said the three centers -- located in Kansas City, Kansas; Warren, Michigan; and Minneapolis -- were acquired in 2005 through its purchase of former rival May Department Stores. \"We simply have too much distribution capacity for the company\\'s needs going forward. In addition, the work performed in some facilities no longer is needed,\" said Federated Vice Chair Tom Cole in a statement. The three distribution centers, which employ 296 workers, will begin phasing out operations on February 4, and their volume will be handled by other Federated facilities. Federated said it also plans to eliminate roughly 249 additional jobs at its distribution centers in Chicago, St. Louis and Bridgeton, Missouri starting in February. The retailer said expenses associated with the consolidations are included in its previous estimate of approximately $1 billion in one-time costs for integrating the May deal. Federated shares declined 9 cents to $41.85 in late morning trading.',\n",

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp. ( SHLD.O ) reported on Thursday that quarterly profit more than tripled because of big gains from some risky investments, cost cutting and improved demand for clothing. \\n\\n The retailer, led by hedge fund manager Edward Lampert, reported a steep decline in cash to $2.1 billion from $3.7 billion at the end of the prior quarter, as it built up inventory for the holiday shopping season. The stock, which had risen some 55 percent this year, fell 4 percent in morning trade as some investors raised concerns that sales at U.S. stores open at least a year continued to slide, falling 3 percent in the latest quarter. The retailer made more money from complicated derivative trades than from its core business of selling appliances or sweaters. The owner of Sears and Kmart stores posted net income of $196 million, or $1.27 per share, in the fiscal third quarter that ended on October 28, up from $58 million, or 35 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected 98 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira said the retailer cannot survive on cost-cutting alone forever, and eventually sales would need to improve. \"On the positive side, the $101 million in investment gains in the quarter is another sign that this management team knows how to make money and is building a war chest for potential acquisitions,\" Shapira wrote in a note to clients. Investors watch Sears Holdings\\' cash position closely because the company has given Lampert authority to invest excess money as he sees fit, prompting rampant speculation that he intends to buy stakes in other retailers. Rumors have circulated that he may be interested in companies ranging from Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) to Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ), although analysts have largely dismissed them. The company does not comment on such rumors. Earlier this week, minority shareholders of Sears Canada Ltd. ( SCC.TO ) rejected a buyout offer from Sears Holdings. Gary Balter, retail analyst with Credit Suisse, said Sears\\' big inventory increases would position the company well to support stronger apparel demand, but \"this is a cash flow story, and over time we want that cash for other purposes,\" he wrote in a note to clients. DERIVATIVE DEALS Results in the latest period included income of 42 cents per share from derivative deals called \"total return swaps\", which the company said involved substantial risks and returns that could vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Total return swaps allow an investor to take on the risk of buying shares of a stock with borrowed money, without actually borrowing the money or buying shares. If the underlying stock performs well, the investor can generate big returns without putting up much money upfront. But if the stock sinks, big losses can ensue. Sears did not disclose which stocks were involved in the swaps, and a spokesman declined to comment beyond the contents of the news release. Total revenue declined by about 2 percent to $11.94 billion. Under Lampert\\'s leadership, Sears has reported declining sales but hefty profit growth thanks to cost-cutting efforts. At Sears stores, same-store sales were down 4.8 percent for the quarter. The company reported pronounced declines in home decor and lawn and garden sales, but women\\'s apparel had strong growth, reversing years of disappointing trends. \"The underlying trends were positive,\" Credit Suisse\\'s Balter wrote. \"Women\\'s apparel, formerly a drag for the company, showed \\'pronounced gains\\' under new merchant Lisa Schultz.\" Schultz was named head of apparel design for Sears and Kmart last year. The retailer noted that last year, it brought in too much fashion-oriented clothing, which hurt demand. Sears stock fell $7.50 to $171.65 on the Nasdaq. The shares trade at about 17.9 times analysts\\' profit forecasts for next year, compared with 14.8 times for sector leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ).

The cut-price drugs are now available in 3,009 pharmacies. Wal-Mart has 3,960 U.S. stores. Wal-Mart said the list of generics, which includes some 143 compounds, represents more than one-fourth of the prescriptions dispensed in its pharmacies nationwide. To date, as new states have been added to the program, 2.1 million more new prescriptions have been filled in those states as compared to the same time periods last year. When Wal-Mart first announced the $4 plan in September, it drove down shares of drugstores chains such as Walgreen Co. and CVS Corp.. The drugstore companies and analysts have said they see little threat from Wal-Mart's plan, noting that cash prescriptions account for only a small portion of their profits.\",\n",
       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) beat analysts\\' forecasts with a 20.9 percent rise in core third-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by higher margins from video game \"World of Warcraft\", pay television in France and Maroc Telecom. \\n\\n But share reaction was muted after the French group, which last week confirmed a failed friendly takeover approach by U.S. private equity firm KKR, kept its profit goal for the year. By 0900 GMT, the stock was up 0.4 percent at 29.97 euros, outperforming a 0.4 percent dip in the European media sector .SXMP and a 0.2 percent rise in the European telecoms sector  .SXKP. The group said it still expects 2006 net adjusted profit of 2.6 billion euros ($3.3 billion), or 16 percent growth, with a dividend distribution rate of a minimum of 50 percent of net profit. Vivendi, which controls France\\'s number two mobile operator SFR, reported adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) of 1.3 billion euros. This compared with average expectations of 1.189 billion euros according to a Reuters poll of 11 analysts and a comparative figure for last year of 1.075 billion. Net adjusted profit reached 731 million euros, up 28.2 percent, also above average expectations of 656 million euros. CANAL, MAROC TELECOM BEAT EXPECTATIONS \"These are rather reassuring results, topping expectations in pay-TV and Maroc Telecom but they did not raise the profit outlook,\" one sector analyst said. Core profit at pay-TV unit Canal Plus was up 51 million euros at 148 million, beating expectations for 111 million euros. Canal Plus\\'s core profit was lifted by growth in pay-TV operations in France, which benefited from strong portfolio additions and increased revenue per subscriber and the favorable impact of the calendar timing of French Ligue 1 soccer. Core profit at Maroc Telecom jumped 21.6 percent in the quarter to 281 million euros, also topping expectations for 262 million, helped by revenue growth and cost control. Core profit at Vivendi Games rose 118.2 percent to 24 million euros, compared with forecasts for 22 million, driven by revenue growth and an increased contribution from the higher margin of the \"World of Warcraft\" business. The SFR mobilephone unit achieved a 2 percent rise in core profit to 706 million euros, almost in line with analysts\\' forecasts for 702 million euros. Cost controls helped offset the rising cost of the GSM license, which was renewed in April with a new tax of 1 percent of revenues, the statement said. On Tuesday, Britain\\'s Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ) said it was happy with its 44-percent stake in SFR and chances of its sale to Vivendi were \"highly unlikely\". Vivendi also owns the world\\'s largest record company Universal Music Group, which posted an 11.3-percent rise in core profit at 138 million euros, thanks to improving margins and compensation from the settlement of litigation with Napster. Analysts had forecast 141 million euros. Since the start of the year, Vivendi shares have gained 11 percent, outperforming the DJ Stoxx media sector .SXMP which rose 7 percent and but underperforming the 14-percent gain in the telecoms index .SXKP.',\n",
       "  ' BARCELONA  (Reuters) - Britain\\'s Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ) said on Thursday it expected strong growth rates at its U.S. venture Verizon Wireless to be maintained in the near term and it was in no hurry to sell its 45 percent stake. \\n\\n Vodafone\\'s Chief Executive Arun Sarin told investors at an Morgan Stanley conference in Barcelona that Verizon Wireless, its venture with Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ), was growing at 18 percent and its value was rising. \"We\\'re clearly conscious of the fact this company won\\'t continue to go on at that rate into infinity but ... This scenario is not changing in the next 6 to 8 months either,\" Sarin said, when asked whether a sale of the Verizon stake could be used to boost the dividend payout. Vodafone was in no hurry to move now, he said. \"As a year or two or three goes on, who knows what opportunities the company will find itself in,\" he said. Vodafone said its present dividend policy of paying out 60 percent of earnings was also unlikely to change. \"I think we have a strong dividend. We\\'re at 60 percent from a low base ... I think we want to stay here for a while before we change it,\" he said. Vodafone was also likely to be extremely choosy when it came to acquisitions, he said. Sarin said he had read plenty of reports regarding the company\\'s acquisitions plans, but said the group had \"strong financial hurdles\" on any major decisions. He said Vodafone was \"clearly interested\" in increasing its stake in Polish operator Polkomtel, but the situation was in limbo because of a dispute over price. Asked about the weakness in the group\\'s UK business, he said the operation faced a difficult environment. \"Prices are falling ... We are looking (to cut) costs in sales and in marketing.\" He said mobile industry trends in Europe were moving similarly to that seen in the U.S. a few years ago. \"In the next 4 or 5 years, we\\'ll easily triple minutes. We do have one or two difficult years to go through in the EU ... We have to get through this phase to come out the other side and of course we have data and broadband and mobile advertising to help add to the revenue stream,\" he said.',\n",
       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - Aerospace group EADS denied plans to let Gulf investors buy part of Airbus to fill a vacuum left when its British partner walked away from a costly new aircraft, but doubts remained over how the plane will be funded. \\n\\n Daily Les Echos said on Thursday EADS ( EAD.PA ) was in advanced talks with Dubai International Capital (DIC) and Qatar Investment Authority over a direct stake in Airbus, which belongs entirely to EADS after BAE Systems BA.L sold back its 20 percent stake. Citing a source close to the matter, the newspaper said EADS was also looking at possible investors from China, India and Russia -- all major markets for Airbus planes -- as well as the United States, home to its rival Boeing ( BA.N ). \"I can deny that. We are not looking for a partner to invest in Airbus,\" an EADS spokesman in Germany said. Afternoon daily Le Monde reported EADS was nonetheless considering scenarios that included investments by the Gulf funds in EADS or -- despite denials -- in Airbus itself. Such a sale would mark the first time EADS, whose recently battered shares have been the target of Russian buying, has opened up the nucleus of the company to direct investment from countries outside its core European manufacturing base. Franco-German EADS has been rocked by delays to its A380 superjumbo and the decision by Britain\\'s BAE to abandon its stake in Airbus, leaving EADS to find at least $10 billion needed to develop its next jet, the A350. EADS shares rose last week when DIC said a fund it manages was considering taking stakes in a number of European firms including EADS. The shares were flat at 22.37 euros at mid-session on Thursday. FUNDING DILEMMA The government of Dubai, commercial hub of the world\\'s top oil-exporting region, owns DIC and Emirates airline, the biggest buyer of the delayed A380. BAE shareholders approved the sale of the company\\'s stake to EADS last month, a day after the company said fresh delays to the A380 would badly hit earnings. The A380 is running two years behind schedule due to wiring installation problems. The delays have left EADS with a 6 billion euro cash shortfall as it pays penalties to airlines and chokes its assembly lines with undelivered aircraft. The damage wrought by the A380 crisis worsened Europe\\'s dilemma over funding for the A350, whose costs have doubled after an earlier design failed to attract enough airlines. Europe faces pressure from the United States in a trade dispute over development loans provided by European governments. Washington regards these as illegal subsidies, while Airbus maintains Boeing is wrongly pampered by the U.S. defense budget. Airbus is anxious to cut its costs by reducing the number of suppliers it deals with and new investment would also ease the task of building the A350 without inflaming the trade row. At the same time, France and Germany are worried about Russia\\'s recent decision to buy 5 percent of EADS stock, meaning the margin for error is slim in any tinkering with EADS capital. EADS has said it will decide by the end of this month whether to go ahead with the A350, once it has put the finishing touches on company-wide restructuring plans. Daily Le Figaro said Airbus might ask for 25 percent of the A350 costs in reimbursable European government loans, or launch aid, rather than the previous ceiling of 33 percent. Following a previously set timetable, U.S. lawyers on Wednesday filed their arguments at the World Trade Organization against the EU over alleged illegal subsidies to Airbus. Hearings are due to be held next March, with a preliminary ruling to be delivered by the WTO panel of judges in September. No dates have yet been set for the EU\\'s counter-suit. Both sides have expressed willingness to talk. (Additional reporting by  Dayan Candappa , Richard Waddington, Jens Hack)',\n",
       "  ' HONG KONG  (Reuters) - A Citigroup-led investment team won a \\n24.3 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) bid for control of China\\'s \\nGuangdong Development Bank, beating out a group led by France\\'s \\nSociete Generale ( SOGN.PA ) and giving the U.S. bank a bigger \\nfoothold in the fast-growing Chinese market. \\n\\n  After a year-and-a-half long bidding process, the Citigroup \\n( C.N ) team won an 85.6 percent stake in a middle-tier bank with \\nbillions of dollars of nonperforming loans on its books but \\nwhich has more than 500 branches and a presence in Guangdong, \\nChina\\'s richest province.  \"You could say Citigroup is trying to take a bad house in a \\ngood neighborhood and fix it up,\" said John Augustine, chief \\ninvestment strategist at Fifth Third Asset Management, which \\nowns 2.6 million Citigroup shares.  Citigroup is hoping to generate more profit \\ninternationally, and banks globally are scrambling to do \\nbusiness in China, whose economy has turned in double-digit \\ngrowth every year for the last five years.  Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), Royal Bank of Scotland \\n( RBS.L ), American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) and Allianz ( ALVG.DE ) \\nhave all booked fat profits from stakes in China\\'s three \\nbiggest state-run lenders, which have just finished an IPO \\nspree worth more than $42 billion.  Citigroup, the largest bank in the U.S., will own 20 \\npercent of Guangdong Development Bank while U.S. technology \\nservices company IBM ( IBM.N ) will own 4.74 percent. The \\nremaining members of the consortium, all of which are Chinese, \\nwill own 60.85 percent.  Citigroup is expected to have de facto control of the bank, \\nbut a source said that decision will not be determined \\ndefinitively until after the sale closes.  Control is a sensitive issue, with China Life Insurance Co. \\n( 2628.HK ) ( LFC.N ) and China\\'s State Grid Corp. each taking 20 \\npercent stakes in the bank. China\\'s CITIC Investment and Puhua \\nInvestment will respectively take 12.85 and 8 percent stakes.  Guangdong Development Bank said it will work with Citigroup \\non eight areas including risk management, corporate governance, \\nasset and debt management, human resources and financial \\ninnovation.  GDB had more than $6 billion in bad debts at the end of \\nlast year, according to sources, which makes for a \\nnonperforming loan ratio of 25 percent, versus a country \\naverage of 8 percent.\\n  OPENING UP  Citigroup\\'s deal comes a day after Beijing released rules \\nfor the full opening of its banking sector next month as \\nrequired by the World Trade Organization.  China, where individuals hold roughly $2 trillion in \\nsavings, will allow Citigroup and rivals like HSBC Holdings \\n( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) to incorporate locally and conduct \\nyuan-currency business with Chinese retail customers for the \\nfirst time.  Citigroup is also negotiating to increase its stake in \\nShanghai Pudong Development Bank ( 600000.SS ) to 20 percent from \\nless than 5 percent, which would give it a sizable presence in \\ntwo of China\\'s wealthiest business hubs.  Citigroup has focused on smaller banks rather than taking \\nsmall stakes in state-controlled behemoths after it missed a \\nchance to invest in No. 3 mainland lender China Construction \\nBank ( 0939.HK ), which sold a 9 percent share to Bank of America \\nlast year for $3 billion.  Citigroup initially sought to buy 40 percent of GDB in a \\nmove that would have circumvented rules capping individual \\nforeign stakes in mainland lenders at 20 percent. Chinese banks \\nare also prohibited from being more than 25 percent \\nforeign-owned.  Citigroup hopes to generate more than half of its profit \\nand revenue outside the United States, up from just over 40 \\npercent now, Chief Executive Charles Prince has said.  The acquisition will boost Citigroup\\'s expenditures in the \\nnear term, and by Fifth Third\\'s Augustine\\'s estimates, could \\ntake five to ten years to really pay off.  Citigroup is under pressure to boost its revenue while \\nkeeping a lid on expense growth.  Citigroup and SocGen resubmitted scaled-down bids at the \\ngovernment\\'s request in June.  SocGen had teamed up with Baoshan Iron and Steel Co. \\n( 600019.SS ) and oil refiner Sinopec Corp. ( 0386.HK ).  Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) advised GDB during the process.  Citigroup shares rose 19 cents, or 0.38 percent, to close \\nat $50.66 on the New York Stock Exchange. In Paris, SocGen \\nshares fell 0.69 percent to 130.30 euros.

But Kimmitt painted an otherwise upbeat picture of the U.S. \\neconomy at a time when officials from many other countries, \\nwhich depend on the United States as a vital export market, \\nhave voiced increasing concern about a possible slowdown in \\ngrowth.  \"Let me say this about the U.S. economy, I think it is \\nsolid in the near and mid-term. There has been some slowdown \\nbecause of the housing market but inflation is low and job \\ncreation is good,\" Kimmitt told reporters.  Finance ministers and central bankers from the G20 \\ncountries were due to hold talks on a wide range of economic \\nissues, including the Chinese yuan, energy and minerals \\nsecurity and the need for more progress on trade \\nliberalization.  Kimmitt said Washington\\'s contribution to evening global \\nmacroeconomic imbalances would be to encourage Americans to \\nincrease their savings while the government tackled its trade \\ndeficit with the rest of the world.  But China, which has allowed only a slow and limited \\nincrease in the yuan\\'s value since Beijing unshackled the \\ncurrency from the U.S. dollar in July 2005, needed to move more \\nswiftly, Kimmitt said.  \"We believe the Chinese need to accelerate their moves on \\nforeign exchange rates,\" he said.  \"I will be meeting with the Chinese central bank governor \\nand I expect that issue (foreign exchange flexibility) will \\ncome up.\"  Treasurer Peter Costello, from host country Australia, said \\nthe inflation outlook and its implications for monetary policy \\naround the world would be a major topic for the G20, which \\ndraws together industrialized and developing countries.  \"The global economy will be a key issue.

The meeting will bring together officials from a diverse \\ngroup of countries, including the United States, China, Saudi \\nArabia, South Africa and Indonesia.  Costello said it was natural that issues relating to the \\nChinese yuan would be brought up at such a meeting of finance \\nministers and central bankers.  \"But it has to be done delicately. Countries don\\'t \\ngenerally respond to lectures from other countries,\" Costello \\nsaid.  \"But in my experience these issues quite frequently come up \\nand I\\'d be surprised if someone didn\\'t raise it.\"  While Britain is pressing for global warming issues to be \\ndiscussed at the meeting, Costello said emission questions \\nwould come up in the context of energy pricing  \"We won\\'t be negotiating a Kyoto-type agreement here,\" \\nCostello said.

Starbucks opened a record 2,199 stores in fiscal year 2006 \\nand plans to open about 2,400 stores during fiscal year 2007, \\nwith about 700 of those abroad.  The company is also expanding the number of U.S. outlets \\nthat sell warm breakfast sandwiches.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Reckson Associates Realty Corp. \\nreceived a $4.6 billion takeover offer on Thursday from \\nbillionaire investor Carl Icahn and Macklowe Properties, \\ntopping a rival bid for the office building owner. \\n\\n  Reckson, whose holdings are concentrated in New York City \\nand its suburbs, will review the new offer, a company \\nspokeswoman said.  The Uniondale, N.Y.-based company later confirmed in a \\nstatement that it received a proposal for $49 per share in cash \\nfor all Reckson\\'s outstanding shares from Rome Acquisition \\nLimited Partnership, formed by entities associated with Harry \\nMacklowe and Icahn.  The new bid comes less than a week before Reckson \\nshareholders are scheduled to vote on a cash-and-stock offer \\nworth roughly $4 billion from SL Green Realty Corp. ( SLG.N ). \\nThe vote is set for November 22 but could be delayed by the \\nIcahn/Macklowe bid.  The SL Green deal calls for a group led by Reckson Chief \\nExecutive Officer Scott Rechler to buy most of the company\\'s \\nsuburban holdings for $2.1 billion after the deal closes.  A group of Reckson shareholders led by Arnhold and S. \\nBleichroeder Advisers LLC opposes the SL Green deal, saying it \\nundervalues the suburban properties. Arnhold controls about 1 \\npercent of Reckson.  Icahn, referring to the proposed sale of Reckson\\'s suburban \\nholdings, told Reuters. \"I think this deal is undervalued.\"  The offer is subject to due diligence but not to financing, \\nIcahn said.  Icahn declined to disclose if he owns Reckson shares. After \\npurchasing large stakes in companies, investors have 10 days to \\nfile with U.S. securities regulators disclosing ownership above \\n5 percent.  SL Green said it would continue to work toward the \\nscheduled Reckson shareholder vote on November 22. Approval \\nrequires least two-thirds of Reckson shareholders to vote in \\nfavor of the deal.  \"While the company has been advised of another offer, we \\nhave doubts that it is a credible bid,\" SL Green said in a \\nstatement. \"The proposal is from a group that has not had \\naccess to any non-public information and has conditioned its \\noffer on due diligence.\"  On the other hand, SL Green has been through Reckson\\'s \\nbooks and said, \"there are substantial incremental transaction \\ncosts that they have likely not considered.\\'  In addition, SL Green said the rival bid does not show that \\nthe rival bidder has the committed and unconditional financing \\nfor a transaction valued in excess of $6.5 billion.  Reckson has $2 billion of debt that would be assumed by any \\nbuyer.  Icahn typically takes large positions in a company and \\nagitates for change. In the real estate arena, he owns more \\nthan 86 percent of American Real Estate Partners LP, which owns \\nrental, hotel and casino properties, according to the company\\'s \\n2005 proxy statement.  Macklowe is one of the largest owners and developers of New \\nYork properties. His portfolio includes the GM building on \\nFifth Avenue, which commands some of the highest office rents \\nin Manhattan.  Shares of Reckson rose $2.94, or 6.52 percent, to close at \\n$48.00 on the New York Stock Exchange. SL Green shares were off \\n$1.03, or 0.81 percent, at $125.89.  Bank of America analyst Ross Nussbaum said a heated bidding \\nwar was unlikely.  \"SL Green has previously been a disciplined buyer,\" he \\nwrote in a research note. \"Putting a higher number on the table \\nwould impact management credibility, in our view.\"  SL Green\\'s offer was $1 to $2 per share below what Reckson \\ncould be expected to fetch, Nussbaum said.  Topping the Icahn/Macklowe offer would mean diluting SL \\nGreen\\'s funds from operations, a measure of the performance of \\nreal estate investment trusts, by as much as 20 cents per share \\nin 2007, Nussbaum said.  Prior to the Icahn/Macklowe offer, shareholder advisory \\nservices -- including Institutional Shareholder Services; \\nGlass, Lewis & Co., and Proxy Governance Inc. -- came out in \\nfavor of the SL Green deal.

Though the company has rolled out aggressive ad campaigns \\n-- including one touting its \"RED\" T-shirts -- brought in a \\nslew of new designers and streamlined its inventory systems, \\nsales at many of its stores have continued to slide.  \"The holidays are going to be a little difficult for Old \\nNavy and Gap is a big unknown,\" said Pacific Growth Equities \\nanalyst Christine Chen. \"The merchandise has improved but it\\'s \\nall about the traffic.\"  Gap shares dropped to $19.62 in electronic trading after \\nclosing at $19.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Earnings for the company, which also operates the Banana \\nRepublic chain and Forth & Towne stores geared to women over \\nthe age of 35, were $189 million, or 23 cents per share, \\ncompared with $212 million, or 24 cents per share, for the same \\nperiod last year.  Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates, on average, had \\nexpected a profit of 22 cents per share.  For the third quarter, total net sales were flat at $3.86 \\nbillion.  Amid ever-growing competition from a host of companies that \\nsell similar casual fashions, shoppers have been passing on \\nfashions at Gap\\'s namesake and Old Navy chains.  Discount department stores such as Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) \\nhave lured away shoppers with their lower clothing prices, \\nwhile Gap\\'s short-lived shift to more fashionable offerings \\nlike skinny-leg pants, away from jeans and T-shirt basics, \\nconfused previously loyal customers.  Third-quarter gross margin rose to 37.4 percent, but the \\ncompany cut its full-year operating margin outlook to about 8 \\npercent, from 8.5 to 9 percent. Analysts scrutinize margin \\ntrends to help determine how much the company is selling at \\nfull price.  Same-store sales, a closely watched measure of sales at \\nstores open at least a year, fell 7 percent at both Old Navy \\nNorth America and Gap North America. Banana Republic sales rose \\n3 percent.  \"Our third-quarter results reflect that each brand is at a \\ndifferent stage in its turnaround,\" Pressler said in a \\nconference call.\\n  LOOKING AHEAD  Previously, Gap had forecast full-year earnings of $1.08 to \\n$1.12 per share, but the company cut its guidance to $1.01 to \\n$1.06, citing the \"deceleration of momentum\" at Old Navy in \\nOctober and November, and an unexpectedly slow turnaround at \\nThe Gap stores.  Analysts had forecast full-year earnings of $1.05 per \\nshare.  \"Old Navy\\'s business continues to be challenging \\nmonth-to-date and momentum at Gap brand is slower than we \\nexpected,\" Pressler said. \"Accordingly, we are lowering our \\nearnings guidance for the year.\"  Analysts have speculated that Gap Inc. shares might rise if \\nit spun off units such as Forth & Towne or sold itself to a \\nprivate equity group. In response to a question about possibly \\nselling any of its brands, a company representative said, \"We \\nbelieve that we can create significant value to our \\nshareholders by staying just focused on our turnaround in the \\nshort run.

Some 30 stores will be opened next spring, with \\na possibly rapid expansion to follow.  The world\\'s largest retailer of athletic shoes and apparel, \\nwhich on Wednesday announced a 39 percent increase in its \\nquarterly dividend, said net income in its third quarter was \\n$65 million, or 42 cents per share, compared with $66 million, \\nor 42 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sales rose 1.6 percent to $1.43 billion, while sales at \\nestablished stores, a key gauge of retail performance, fell 0.3 \\npercent, the New York-based company said.  The company has seen its profit crimped from tepid sales in \\nEurope, but Chief Executive Matthew Serra said in a statement \\nthat the company had stabilized its earnings in that region \\ncompared to the year-ago period.  Serra said he expects earnings in the fourth quarter to \\nincrease \"several cents per share versus the same quarter last \\nyear.\"  Full-year earnings per share from continuing operations are \\nexpected to range between $1.50 and $1.57, including a charge \\nof 8 cents per share related to a write-down of European \\nassets.

Analysts, on average, are expecting full-year earnings per \\nshare of $1.55, excluding items, according to Reuters \\nEstimates.\\n  BUYOUT LESS LIKELY?  Foot Locker in August said it had hired Evercore Partners, \\nto advise on a range of matters, spurring speculation of a \\nbuyout.  But some analysts interpreted the higher dividend announced \\non Wednesday as a sign that a buyout would be less likely. The \\nresulting less availability of cash on hand would make the \\ncompany less attractive to a potential private equity buyer, \\nanalysts said in research notes to clients.

Several automakers, including Japan\\'s Mitsubishi Motors Corp ( 7211.T ) and South Korea\\'s Hyundai Motor ( 005380.KS ) and Chery were reportedly named as Chrysler\\'s likely partner. \"We have been talking to a number of partners, which has been reduced to a very small number,\" Zetsche told reporters on the sidelines of the Beijing Autoshow. \"I am optimistic that we are coming to a decision in the not-so-far future,\" he added. \"But it takes two to tango.\" He declined to say whether negotiations with China\\'s Chery were exclusive but added Chery was the only Chinese company that the auto giant is talking with currently. Sources told Reuters in September that DaimlerChrysler and Chery were in detailed talks to make cars for sale in the United States and other markets. An option being considered is for Chery to provide the models and make revisions at the request of DaimlerChrysler DCX.N, while the cars would be made at Chery plants in China, the source said. But the  two parties are far apart in profit-sharing and other technical details, they added. When asked whether Volkswagen\\'s ( VOWG.DE ) restructuring whiz Wolfgang Bernhard would join DaimlerChrysler if he handed in his resignation, Zetsche said he \"has no reason to participate in this speculation.\" German newspaper Handelsblatt on Tuesday said Bernhard, VW brand chief and reform driver, was seriously considering stepping down after Volkswagen appointed Martin Winterkorn as its future chief executive, replacing Bernd Pischetsrieder. \"I still do not have official confirmation that his current situation will change.

Ford has promised to launch at least one new product in China every year. The S-MAX, which Ford calls an \"SAV\", or sports activity vehicle, will be built at its main joint venture plant in Chongqing and sold from early next year. The vehicle was voted European Car of the Year this week, joining both the Focus and Mondeo in receiving the prestigious award. Ford, whose North American operations have been hit by sliding market share and hefty incentives spending, is counting on China to take on a bigger role in its global operations to nurse the company back to health. To accelerate that, Ford will open a research and engineering center in Nanjing, in eastern China, investing an initial $27.5 million. The facility would support product development and parts procurement in China, and later serve other brands in product development globally, Cheng said. Ford said it would also expand its auto financing business, now operating in more than 70 Chinese cities after just 18 months. Combined with other brands in the Ford group -- including Mazda Motor Corp., Land Rover, Jaguar and Volvo -- sales in China are set to reach 300,000 units this year, Cheng said, giving it a 7 percent market share based on a forecast for passenger car sales of 4.1 million units this year. Japan\\'s Mazda, one-third owned by Ford, has dragged on the group as sales of the once-popular Mazda6 sedan and Mazda 323 slowed. A seven-month output suspension of the Mazda3, a hot-selling sedan in other markets, also hurt. Mazda3 production resumed earlier this month, but a sales start is pending approval by local authorities. Mazda executives, speaking at a separate press conference, declined to provide further details. Mazda\\'s January-October sales in China fell 7 percent to 101,000 units. Last year, they jumped 51 percent to 134,000. Mazda has targeted sales of 300,000 units in China by 2010, with plans to launch eight new products between 2005 and 2007, and at least one new model every year beyond that. To keep up with demand, Ford and Mazda\\'s three-way local venture with Changan Automobile Co. Ltd., called Changan Ford Mazda Automobile, is expanding capacity in Chongqing to 250,000 units a year in 2007 from 200,000 units.

GM\\'s incentive program, called \"Red Tag\" sale, starts Saturday and will run through January 2, GM spokesman John McDonald said. Ford\\'s program also runs through January 2 and includes interest-free financing for up to 60 months on some 2006 vehicles. The new cash rebate offers of $1,000 are on its Fusion sedan, Super Duty pickup truck, Escape SUV, Five Hundred sedan and Freestyle wagon. Including existing rebates, discounts on some Ford vehicles could reach $3,000. GM discounts will be available on 2006 and 2007 model-year Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick, Saturn and GMC vehicles. \"The reason we are doing this is to boost sales momentum going into 2007,\" McDonald said. GM\\'s U.S. sales were down about 9 percent through October, while Ford\\'s U.S. sales were down 7 percent. GM is giving cash to dealers, who will decide which vehicles will get discounts and how much, instead of the usual practice of setting discounts per vehicle, McDonald said. This is the third straight year that GM is running a year-end \"Red Tag\" sale. A red tag on the vehicle will display the discount. McDonald said GM has reduced overall incentive spending by $660 per vehicle year-to-date compared with the same period last year and the \"Red Tag\" promotion fits with the automaker\\'s decision to use incentives strategically.',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The billionaire hedge fund manager who runs Sears Holding Corp. ( SHLD.O ) rarely speaks in public, but he has been sending a message to shareholders: Have faith. \\n\\n Sears stockholders have done pretty well lately putting their trust in Sears Chairman Edward Lampert, a finance guru some consider a next-generation Warren Buffett who might transform Sears into a holding company in the mold of Buffett\\'s Berkshire Hathaway. But while the stock has jumped nearly 50 percent this year, investors might feel left in the dark about the company\\'s strategy and even the particulars on how it\\'s making money. The company\\'s reticence -- it no longer provides earnings forecasts or gives out monthly sales data -- and reluctance to discuss its long-term plans have put off some money managers who say they won\\'t invest in the stock. Some observers say it\\'s impossible to get a good handle on the business and that many individual investors probably have little idea of how much Sears has shifted away from traditional retail. Sears in many ways is transforming itself into a quasi-hedge fund along the lines of Lampert\\'s ESL Investments fund for wealthy clients. \"If you are investing in the company, you are investing every bit as much in Lampert\\'s investing strategy as you are investing in the retailing results,\" said Joseph Carcello, co-founder of the University of Tennessee\\'s Corporate Governance Center. \"This isn\\'t your father\\'s Sears.\" The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer said earlier this week that about one-third of its total earnings per share in the third quarter came from gains it made from complex derivative contracts known as \"total return swaps.\" Under these agreements, the investor takes on the risk of an investment without actually owning the security. Hedge funds are known for secrecy, something that Lampert is clearly trying to replicate within the confines of the disclosure rules required for a public company, said David Baker, a principal at money manager North American Management Corp., which oversees $1 billion in assets but does not invest in Sears. \"Sears is clearly becoming less transparent,\" he said. \"It\\'s not just the lack of disclosure. It\\'s that I don\\'t like what he\\'s (Lampert\\'s) investing in, because I can\\'t quantify the risk.\" Already, Sears\\' debt is considered a riskier bet than most of its peers. Its senior unsecured debt is rated a \"Ba1\" -- the highest junk level -- by Moody\\'s Investors Service. For its size, the company is one of the largest high-yield retailers in the world, said Moody\\'s analyst Charles O\\'Shea. COMPLEX DERIVATIVE DEALS In its profit report this week, the Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer said the derivative contracts, which generated $101 million in investment gains in the three months, involved substantial risks and that returns could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. But it did not provide many other details, including whether the derivative deals involved investments in the shares of other retailers or other types of companies altogether. The lack of information about these derivative contracts is troubling, said James Huguet, president and chief executive of Great Companies Inc., an asset management firm that does not hold Sears shares. Sears \"is not the type of company we would invest in,\" said Huguet, whose Tampa, Florida investment firm oversees $350 million. \"I would not be comfortable looking at a company that\\'s had a one-time shot or a nonrecurring event where you can\\'t be sure what earnings are going to do in the future.\" A Sears spokesman declined to provide additional details about the total return swaps beyond what was in the earnings statement. Because Sears has kept Wall Street at arms length, few stock analysts now cover the company. Lampert, who engineered Kmart\\'s $12.3 billion buyout of Sears, Roebuck and Co., does not comment in public very often and investors must rely on his periodic \"Message from the Chairman\" letters to glean his insights into the business. Baker, of North American Management, said it\\'s understandable that Sears, like some other companies, would want to move away from Wall Street\\'s short-term focus by giving up quarterly earnings guidance. But he said the company should give investors more to go on if they want people to understand the business. \"Eddie is running it like it\\'s his own entity, but you can\\'t have your cake and eat it too, so to speak,\" he said. \"Quite honestly, if he doesn\\'t want to deal with Wall Street, he should take the thing private.\"',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) said on Thursday it plans to acquire cardiovascular device company Conor Medsystems Inc. CONR.O for about $1.4 billion in cash. \\n\\n The maker of Band-Aid bandages and other health care products will pay $33.50 for each share of Conor Medsystems, which makes drug-eluting stents used to keep blocked arteries open. The offer represents a 22 percent premium to Conor Medsystems\\' closing share price of $27.52 on Nasdaq. The deal comes nearly a year after J&J lost out to rival Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) in a bidding war for heart device maker Guidant. After that, analysts had expected J&J to re-enter the acquisition market as it pursued new growth strategies. J&J spokesman Jeffrey Leebaw said the Conor Medsystems deal was unrelated to losing out on Guidant. Conor Medsystems\\' CoStar stent, which provides controlled drug delivery, is currently sold outside the United States. The stent is an investigational device in the United States, where enrollment in a pivotal clinical trial has been completed, according to Johnson & Johnson. J&J unit Cordis, which Conor Medsystems will become part of after the deal, sells coronary artery stents. The transaction, which is subject to anti-trust clearance and approval by Conor Medsystems\\' shareholders, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2007. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the deal. Upon closing, J&J said it expects to incur an after-tax charge of about $600 million, reflecting the write-off of in-process research and development charges. Excluding the charge, J&J said it expects the deal to reduce earnings per share \"modestly\" in 2007. (Additional reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles)',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The pace of U.S. home building fell sharply in October in a sign that the housing sector may still have a rocky road ahead, government data showed on Friday. \\n\\n New home starts dropped 14.6 percent to their lowest level in more than six years in October and building permits fell 6.3 percent, according to the Commerce Department. A healthy housing sector had been key to recent economic expansion but growth has slowed sharply after a robust start to the year. Homebuilding activity has dropped and auto-makers have cut back on production as the economy moved ahead at just a 1.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Many economists had thought the worst of the housing slump had already passed -- and data released earlier this week seemed to support that idea -- but Friday\\'s data cast doubt on that view. \"The raw number (housing starts) looks incredibly weak,\" said Robert McIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management of Boston. U.S. government bond prices rose after the fresh housing data signaled weakness in the market, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to around 4.62 percent. The dollar fell and U.S. stocks were expected to open lower. The Commerce Department said October housing starts came in at an annual pace of 1.486 million units, compared with a pace of 1.74 million units in September. Economists had forecast October housing starts to fall to 1.690 million units from September\\'s originally reported pace of 1.772 million. Compared to a year earlier, October housing starts were down 27.4 percent from the October 2005 pace of 2.046 million units. Permits for future groundbreaking, an indicator of builder confidence, fell 6.3 percent to an annual pace of 1.535 million units, the lowest rate since December 1997, from a 1.638 million pace in September. Economists had expected the Commerce Department to report October permits at a 1.625 million pace. Permit applications were down 28 percent from October 2005. Economists said the data suggested the economy was slowing, perhaps even more than the Federal Reserve foresees. \"I think there is a risk that the economy will underperform the Fed\\'s expectations. We have seen some signs of manufacturing weakness as well as housing emerging,\" said David Sloan, economist at 4Cast in New York. The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady when its policy-making group meets in December, but views are mixed on whether it will begin cutting rates next year to bolster the economy. Other data released this week painted a healthier picture of the nation\\'s housing sector. A private survey of U.S. homebuilders\\' sentiment ticked higher in November. The National Association of Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index on Thursday got a two-point bump to 33 points in November. The survey hit at 15-year low of 30 in September. On Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that applications for U.S. home mortgages rose last week to their highest level since January as falling interest rates encouraged more loan refinancing. The group\\'s seasonally adjusted index of total mortgage applications increased 4.3 percent in the week ended November 10 to 647.5, up 2.6 percent on the week. Residential mortgage refinancing surged to its fastest rate since October 2005, the MBA said.',\n",

October building permits fell 6.3 percent, compared to a 5.2 percent fall in September. The 1.535 million annual rate for building permits was the lowest since December 1997.   COMMENTARY: BILL HORNBARGER, CHIEF FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST, A.G.  EDWARDS & SONS, ST. LOUIS: \"These are certainly soft numbers but I don\\'t think there is any surprise there. Housing has certainly been one of the areas of the economy that has been very weak. Our economist has been using the term that housing is in recession.\" \"It doesn\\'t (change our Fed view) but we think that the Fed is done raising rates anyway. I don\\'t think it brings (rate cuts) forward. I think they are going to need to see another couple months more of friendly inflation data.\" GARY SHILLING, PRESIDENT, A. GARY SHILLING & CO. INVESTMENT  RESEARCH FIRM. SPRINGFIELD, NEW JERSEY: \"The housing market is literally collapsing. Why stocks have been ignoring this, I don\\'t know. Builders have already panicked, but we haven\\'t yet seen the big collapse in prices, because people believe their house is unique and they\\'re unwilling to reduce prices to attract buyers. DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST AT 4CAST IN NEW YORK \"Extremely weak. The permits are extending a severe down turn while starts having risen in September saw a steeper than trend fall to correct the increase. There have been a few tentative signs that the housing demand may start to bottom out, such as the home builders survey yesterday. Certainly the housing investment is not recovering yet. \"The Fed is not really inclined to ease rates. I think the Fed is still debating whether to tighten or not. After yesterday CPI data and these and some other data, the case for tightening doesn\\'t look very strong. I don\\'t think they are yet starting to debate easing. I think there is a risk that the economy will underperform the Fed\\'s expectations. We have seen some signs of manufacturing weakness as well as housing emerging.\" ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT,  BOSTON: \"The raw number (housing starts) looks incredibly weak. As for the Fed -- everything else being equal -- this means they will cut pretty damn fast if this is what\\'s happening to the housing and these numbers are real. Though the employment numbers from last week have postponed any cuts for a while.\" GEORGE DAVIS, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL  MARKETS, TORONTO: \"I think for the most part the market had been leaning towards a little weaker than expected outcome for both the housing starts and the building permits. But the numbers we got were much weaker than expected. As a result we\\'ve seen the dollar weaken marginally. But given there\\'s no other major data releases today we\\'ll probably see the dollar trade with a slightly negative bias for the rest of the session.\"  MARKET REACTION: - U.S. Treasury debt prices rose on the housing data with the benchmark 10 year note yield falling to around 4.62 percent. - The dollar slipped, with the euro firming to around $1.2785  EUR= , and the dollar down to 118.25 yen  JPY= . - U.S. S&P500 stock futures fell to around 1400.75.',\n",
       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Friday that it would be no surprise if euro holdings grew, but did not see this knocking the dollar from its perch as the world\\'s reserve currency. \\n\\n \"It would be very difficult to displace the dollar as a central holding of central banks,\" Fisher told a panel discussion at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress. \"However, I would not be the least bit surprised, and in fact I would encourage, increased depth and breadth to euro holdings as well. It\\'s good for us ... two authorities to compete with each other, to encourage discipline,\" he said. Fed officials rarely comment on the dollar and generally leave it to the U.S. Treasury to make remarks that can influence its value on foreign exchange markets. From time to time, however, central bank officials have noted that a rebalancing in global portfolios in favor of the euro was to be expected. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said last month he believed the portfolio shift from the dollar into the euro  EUR=  was likely on the cards and may already be under way. Fisher acknowledged that the desire of investors to diversify their portfolio risks was a powerful force. \"Such diversification seems likely to occur gradually, and the option to diversify is surely a benefit to the world as a whole,\" he said. But he saw no need for this trend to be the trigger for a sharp drop in the dollar\\'s exchange rate value. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s unhealthy for the euro to have increasing acceptance in central banking reserves. It does not mean you have to sell dollars to buy euros. I don\\'t think you precipitate a crisis by a buildup of reserves,\" Fisher said. \"The question is: \\'Is there going to be a large shock to the dollar?\\' I doubt it,\" he said. \"An eclipse of the dollar is very unlikely in the near term. Even so, the Fed must be ever vigilant in preserving the value of the dollar.\" INFLATION WATCH Asked about the inflation climate in the United States, after another sharp fall in the consumer price index last month thanks to lower energy prices, Fisher stressed that the Fed had \"no tolerance for inflation above 2 percent.\" \"We\\'ve made it clear that we become uncomfortable above the 2 percent level. The issue is not where inflation is now, it\\'s where it\\'s going,\" said Fisher, who is not a voting member of the Fed\\'s interest-rate setting committee this year. U.S. consumer price inflation dropped 0.5 percent in October as energy prices tumbled. CPI rose 1.3 percent year-on-year on an unadjusted basis. But core consumer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, were up 2.7 percent year-on-year, above the \"comfort zone\" of Fisher and many other Fed officials. However, the increase in core prices over the 12 months through October marked a deceleration from the 2.9 percent rise in the year through September, raising the prospect that core inflation had peaked. But Fisher told reporters that it was too early to tell. \"We must be constantly vigilant,\" he said. While the data were encouraging, he said \"one month\\'s data does not make a trend.\" At their last rate-setting meeting in October, Fed officials said their greatest concern was the risk that inflation might not fall as hoped, prompting markets to scale back bets that the Fed\\'s next rate move could be a cut. The Fed has held the benchmark federal funds rate at 5.25 percent since June, deciding at its last three meetings to sit tight to watch if inflation eases amid slower economic growth.',\n",
       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - A more than $3 plunge in oil prices to their lowest levels for nearly two years has not ended a sustained bull run, but could jolt OPEC into further defensive action. \\n\\n A two-day fund-driven sell-off pushed U.S. crude to a low of around $55 a barrel on Friday, its weakest since June 2005 and at the bottom of the price range OPEC officials say the group needs to protect its revenues. \"It\\'s the classic middle of a bull market. I don\\'t think people are going to exit en masse,\" said Mark Matthias of British investment specialist Dawnay Day Quantum. \"It\\'s only a stage in the market... I suspect OPEC will be able to impose a level of discipline,\" he said, adding price support would also come from a return of political risk. U.S. oil would have to fall decisively below $48 to break the three-year rally and technical analysts said strong support around $52 for U.S. crude and then a major psychological barrier at $50 stood in the way. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries recognizes that a stall in the charge that took prices from $30 a barrel in December 2003 to $78.40 in July could force another cut in output when the group meets in December. OPEC is monitoring signs of a slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in top fuel consumer the United States, ample levels of stocks and forecasts for a big increase in non-OPEC supply. Already, OPEC decided last month to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day from November 1. Mike Wittner of investment bank Calyon said OPEC would be obliged to pare back production, but an uptick in demand would do much of its work. \"Stocks are high. I think they do need to cut and at this point, they need to cut simply because they have said they\\'re going to cut,\" said Wittner. \"But the real driver is going to be good, old-fashioned demand.\" DOUBTS ABOUT OPEC Doubts about OPEC\\'s ability to stick to its existing supply pact have helped to drive this week\\'s sell-off. Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix, said Friday\\'s price drop was exaggerated because the U.S. December crude futures contract expired at close of trade. \"If the collapse had happened at another time, it would be much more bearish,\" he said. The January contract, which becomes the new front month after the weekend, was trading around $58 a barrel, just within the market\\'s six-week range of around $58-$62 -- bang in the middle of the protracted bull run. But that would probably not reassure OPEC, whose economies have grown ever more dependent on high oil revenues to balance their budgets and finance ambitious spending projects, including plans to increase oil capacity. Nigerian Oil Minister Edmund Daukoru, also OPEC\\'s president, told Reuters on Wednesday a cut in December was \"most likely because the price is still alternating between $58 and $60.\" Roger Diwan of PFC Energy in Washington said he saw leading OPEC producer Saudi Arabia aiming for a U.S. crude price of between $55 and $65. \"There\\'s a revenue target for Saudi Arabia and it all starts from there,\" said Roger Diwan of PFC Energy in Washington. \"OPEC\\'s ultimate benchmark remains prices.\" While OPEC is keen to keep prices strong, it is also wary of destroying economic growth and demand for its crude. Energy analysts are divided about the future strength of the world\\'s biggest economy. \"Our outlook is very, very bearish for the U.S. economy,\" said Harry Tchilinguirian of BNP Paribas. But he still predicted prices would rally after weakness in the first half of next year. \"There is still tightness in refining capacity, there is still supply disruption in Nigeria and Iraq ... Geopolitical threats have receded, but they are still there,\" he said. For poll on analyst price forecasts, click on <O/POLL> Another major source of strength is investment class money that has moved into oil and other commodities for the long term. Goldman Sachs said its commodities index, which is the market\\'s biggest investment vehicle, would increase to around $110 billion by January and Dawnay Day\\'s Matthias said he saw no reason for investors to turn away. \"Taking a three-to-five year view, I would be a buyer of oil below $60,\" said Matthias.

NYMEX closed at $132.99, up $73.99 on the day. \"It was what we call controlled chaos,\" said broker Doreen Mogavero, chief executive of Mogavero, Lee & Co., of the scene on the New York Stock Exchange floor when NYMEX began trading. \"It was very, very exciting.\" The opening-day stock surge gave NYMEX a market value of about $12 billion, vaulting it into fifth place among exchanges globally as ranked by market capitalization, ahead of Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) and the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ). NYMEX\\'s opening gains were the largest of this year\\'s IPOs, beating out fast-food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. ( CMG.N ), which gained as much as 118 percent on its opening day. The big debut also reflected gathering momentum in the overall initial public offering market as stock markets reach six-year highs. Friday\\'s gains leave NYMEX trading at over 70 times annualized adjusted 2006 earnings, far higher than many competitors, said Francis Gaskins, president of research firm IPO Desktop.

The soaring IPO may have also given a boost to other exchanges -- including Atlanta-based ICE, which was up nearly 7 percent to close at $101.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. IPO UNDERPRICED? On Thursday the 6.5 million share offering raised $383.5 million after selling for $59 per share, compared with a $54 to $57 forecast range. The gap between the offering price and the market price raised questions about why the offering\\'s underwriters didn\\'t price it even higher. \"NYMEX may have decided that rather than raise the price higher, they would take the publicity.

In March, the NYSE Group Inc., which owns the No. 1 U.S. stock exchange, floated its shares, rising 25 percent to $80 on their first day of trading. It is poised to acquire Paris-based rival Euronext ENXT.PA. Earlier this year, NYMEX struck a deal to sell a 10 percent stake to private equity group General Atlantic LLC for $160 million.

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Milton Friedman, one of the most influential economists of the past century and a champion of free markets, died on Thursday morning of heart failure at age 94, a family spokeswoman said. \\n\\n The winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize for economics, Friedman preached free enterprise in the face of government regulation and advocated a monetary policy involving steady growth in money supply, ideas that played pivotal roles in the governing philosophies of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. \"Milton Friedman revived the economics of liberty, when it had been all but forgotten,\" Thatcher said in a statement. \"He was an intellectual freedom fighter. Never was there a less dismal practitioner of \\'the dismal science\\' (economics).\" U.S. President George W. Bush said Friedman \"helped advance human dignity and human freedom.\" \"His work demonstrated that free markets are the great engines of economic development,\" Bush said in a statement from Singapore where he is on a weeklong Asia trip. \"His writings laid the groundwork that transformed many of the world\\'s central banks, helping deliver economic stability and improved living standards in countries around the world.\" \"If you had to ask people across the world to name an economist, by far his name would be the most common,\" Gary Becker, who won the 1992 Nobel Prize for economics, told Reuters. \"He could express the most complicated economic ideas in the most simple language.\" Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a statement the \"direct and indirect influences of his thinking on contemporary monetary economics would be difficult to overstate. Just as important, in his humane and engaging way, Milton conveyed to millions an understanding of the economic benefits of free, competitive markets, as well as the close connection that economic freedoms bear to other types of liberty.\" Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan added: \"He had been a fixture in my life both professionally and personally for a half century. My world will not be the same.\" INFLUENCED REAGAN \"You look at what Reagan did, it was what Milton had been advocating for a long time,\" said Martin Anderson, a Hoover Institution fellow and domestic and economic policy adviser to the Republican Reagan. \"What Milton did was to confirm what he (Reagan) thought and make it more confident, and that became \\'Reaganomics.\\'\" While Friedman found favor among conservatives, he was most interested in obtaining practical results by tapping markets, said Robert Reich, a labor secretary in the Democratic Clinton administration. \"He was more experimental than doctrinaire.\" Ken Livingstone, London\\'s left-wing mayor, credited Friedman for inspiring his flagship \"congestion charge\" policy to reduce traffic by charging drivers for entering the city\\'s center. \"The biggest effect Milton Friedman had was making inflation unacceptable,\" said Tom Campbell, a graduate student under Friedman and dean of the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. \"We don\\'t talk about the risk of inflation in the 10, 12, 20 percent range anymore because people won\\'t stand for it.\" CONTROVERSIAL In 1976, Friedman\\'s years of teaching and nearly two dozen books were recognized with the Nobel Prize for economic science. Friedman, however, was not without controversy. His work was not initially popular, emerging at a time when government spending and intervention were widely credited with helping end the worldwide depression of the 1930s. His Nobel ceremony in Stockholm prompted a large turnout of demonstrators who criticized him for economic advice he provided the government of Augusto Pinochet, who led Chile\\'s 17-year dictatorship in which some 3,000 leftists were killed. \"He tried not to let the political composition of the government interfere with things he thought would be better for the people in the country,\" said Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, Friedman raised his profile further as a columnist and contributing editor for Newsweek magazine and through frequent television appearances. In a retrospective on his work, the Brooklyn-born Friedman traced his roots and those of the so-called Chicago school of economics back to 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith. He moved to California in 1977, when he became a senior research fellow at Stanford University\\'s Hoover Institution. (Additional reporting by  Alister Bull  in Washington)',\n",
       "  ' MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said healthy global economic growth remains on track, but he warned central bankers must be on high alert to tackle inflationary dangers. \\n\\n \"We see a need for central bankers, not only in industrialized countries but certainly in emerging ones, to be extremely vigilant on inflationary pressures,\" Rato told a briefing ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the Group of 20 countries. Rato said he sees no sign that oil prices will fall any time soon and the scope for excess production capacity in the world economy is becoming more limited. These factors together present potential inflationary pressures in a world in which liquidity is abundant, he said. Rato said one of the risks to global output is an abrupt decline it the U.S. economy trigged by this U.S. housing slowdown, but currently he does not expect that to happen. \"What we see right now is not a sharp deceleration. For the Federal Reserve there is still a risk of inflation and for this (risk) to materialize,\" he said. \"We see a need for the monetary authority in the U.S. to remain vigilant at this time.\" The Fed has raised interest rates by 4.25 percentage points to 5.25 percent over the past two years. But since the last of its string of quarter-point increases in June of this year, the Fed has paused to evaluate the state of the economy. As for the euro zone, Rato said stronger-than-expected growth was helping offset a slowing in the United States and he saw room for further tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB). \"We see a need for the monetary authorities in Europe to move toward neutrality but we do not see a need for a restrictive monetary policy, certainly not now,\" he said. Rato declined to say how close he thought the ECB was to reaching \"neutral\" rates. The ECB, whose benchmark rate is currently 3.25 percent, is expected to raise rates to 3.5 percent in December, a level that many analysts say is the beginning of a neutral range. It has given no clear signal on monetary policy direction thereafter, although some ECB officials have indicated they are worried about price pressures and would like rates to head higher. Rato gave a cautious assessment of Japan. \"Inflation data are still relatively weak,\" he said. \"Recent (data) has shown the economy is growing at a good rhythm, but domestic demand is not as strong as we would like.\" The IMF chief declined to give a monetary recommendation. The Bank of Japan has raised interest rates to 0.25 percent from virtually zero and markets are speculating on the timing of its next move. The BOJ has left the door open to raising rates again before year-end, although markets generally believe it will wait until early 2007 at least.

( HPQ.N ) said on Friday it named Wachovia Corp.\\'s WB.N chief executive to its board, filling one of the vacancies created by the computer and printer maker\\'s board leak scandal that prompted the departure of three directors. \\n\\n Separately, HP said in a filing late on Thursday that securities regulators had elevated an investigation into the company\\'s probe of boardroom leaks. Ken Thompson, CEO of the U.S. No. 4 bank, is the ninth member of HP\\'s board of directors and its seventh outside director, the company said on Friday. After the close of regular trade on Thursday, HP posted better-than-expected results and issued a forecast for the current period that topped analysts\\' estimates. Shares fell on Friday, however, as investors concluded that much of the good news had already been factored into the stock price. \"With the major restructuring actions behind us, we believe it will be increasingly difficult for HP to maintain its pattern of beating estimates and raising guidance,\" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore in a note to clients. Shares of HP fell 42 cents, or 1 percent to $39.74 on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year, the stock is up nearly 40 percent. Thompson\\'s appointment, which took effect on November 16, comes amid a widening probe of the Palo Alto, California-based company\\'s tactics in identifying reporters and company directors who leaked confidential company information to the media. Venture capitalist and former director Thomas Perkins resigned in May 2006 over what he claimed were objections to some of the tactics used to ferret out the board leaks. Former director and retired HP executive George Keyworth ultimately confessed to being the source for some of the leaks and he resigned. Former Chairman Patricia Dunn, after the board room leak scandal erupted in September, offered to resign if asked to by the board. Ultimately, she also resigned. In the filing, HP said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had issued a formal order of investigation in its previously disclosed inquiry of the company\\'s boardroom probe. HP also said in the filing that it received a request from the Federal Communications Commission for records and information relating to the leak investigations. HP on Friday also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 8 cents per share and set the date for its next annual meeting on March 14 in Santa Clara, California.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Mentor Corp. and Allergan Inc. have won U.S. approval to resume widespread sales of silicone-gel breast implants for the first time since 1992, U.S. health officials said on Friday. \\n\\n Each company will be required to study the safety and effectiveness of the implants in 40,000 women for 10 years, the Food and Drug Administration said. Silicone breast implants had been banned for most U.S. women after some complained the devices leaked and made them chronically ill. Both makers also announced the approvals, which cleared the devices for cosmetic use in women ages 22 and older and for breast reconstruction in women of all ages. Dr. Daniel Schultz, director of FDA\\'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said the manufacturers had presented data that provided \"reasonable assurance of the benefits and risks\" that would enable women to make informed decisions. Some complications reported in the companies\\' studies included breast pain, hardening of the area around the implant, change in nipple sensation, implant rupture and the need for additional surgery, the FDA said. Most women in the studies said they were happy with the implants. \"We now have a good understanding of what complications can occur and at what rates. We also know that women who get these devices will probably need to have additional breast implant surgery at least once,\" Schultz said. Silicone breast implants are among the most extensively studied medical devices, Schultz added. Saline-filled breast implants had been the only option for most U.S. women since sales restrictions were put in place in 1992. Plastic surgeons say the silicone ones look and feel more natural. A number of independent studies found no convincing evidence that breast implants were associated with connective tissue diseases or cancer, the FDA said. The manufacturers\\' post-approval studies are expected to further examine those issues. Opponents criticized the FDA decision, saying complications were likely for most women and long-term health risks were unknown. \"The FDA\\'s standards for implants has reached a new low with this decision,\" said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said the approval \"appears to be yet another example of the FDA dismissing scientific evidence in order to appease corporate interests.\" \"When Congress reconvenes next session, it must examine the agency\\'s approval process and ensure that the FDA makes decisions based on science and not on corporate and political considerations,\" DeLauro said.',\n",

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson\\'s ( JNJ.N ) proposed $1.4 billion cash takeover of stent maker Conor Medsystems CONR.O is expected to bolster the diversified health care product maker\\'s declining share in the market for cardiovascular devices, analysts said on Friday. \\n\\n The deal, unveiled late on Thursday, comes amid growing debate about the safety of drug-eluting stents -- tiny wire mesh tubular devices that prop open surgically-cleared heart arteries and deliver medication to keep them from renarrowing from scar tissue growth. The worldwide market for these devices is about $6 billion. J&J and Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) are the only two companies approved to sell the devices in the lucrative U.S. market, but competition from Abbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ) and Medtronic Inc. ( MDT.N ) is on the horizon. Both sell drug-eluting stents outside the United States and are gearing up for U.S. launches in mid-2007 or early 2008. \"Why do a deal now? The real question is, why not?\" said medical technology analyst Michael Barr of Victory Capital Management, which owns J&J shares. \"Conor definitely has a novel technology -- using multiple drugs on a stent is attractive -- and now they\\'re pairing with the company that has the deepest pockets. The ability to get Conor\\'s products out of the pipeline and onto the market is clearly enhanced,\" he added. \"BACK IN THE DRIVER\\'S SEAT\" \"We had viewed J&J as the incremental loser in the stent market,\" added Morgan Stanley analyst Glenn Reicin, \"but this deal could put J&J back in the driver\\'s seat.\" Without Conor\\'s Costar stent, J&J was not expected to have a second-generation drug-eluting stent until 2009 in Europe and 2010 in the United States, noted Prudential Securities analyst Lawrence Biegelsen. He said Boston Scientific stands to lose the most from the deal because Conor\\'s Costar may have safety advantages over Boston Scientific\\'s Taxus stent. In addition, J&J\\'s vast resources will improve the chances of Conor prevailing in intellectual property litigation with Boston Scientific. Steven Scruggs, portfolio manager of Bragg Financial Advisors, which also holds J&J shares, said he viewed the deal as a risky option. \"It could be a high return deal or it could be worthless and completely fizzle, but a $1 billion deal is nothing for J&J,\" he said. \"It does raise the question about whether they\\'re doing a deal because there\\'s a problem with their own stent system.\" Victory Capital\\'s Barr said the relatively low price of $33.50 per Conor share that J&J is paying reflects litigation risk. The shares closed at $27.52 on Thursday before the deal was announced. Analysts said they did not foresee antitrust issues, but were eager to review the merger documents, which have not yet been filed. Michael Weinstein, an analyst with JP Morgan, said he assumes Costar will capture 12 percent market share in Europe and 15 percent in the United States in 2008 and 2009. \"Buying Conor does, in our view, make for a stronger J&J. The deal strengthens the company\\'s long-term competitiveness in drug-eluting stents and should, if Conor\\'s first generation product Costar is able to make its way on the U.S. market, soften the blow of multiple new entrants in 2008,\" Weinstein wrote in a research note. \"We note that it\\'s still not a sure thing that Costar reaches the U.S. market, or at least in the timeline that the Street currently expects,\" he added. COUNTER-BID UNLIKELY Analysts said they did not anticipate a competitive bid. A counter-bid by Boston Scientific would likely raise Federal Trade Commission anti-trust issues, they said. \"While a bid by Abbott or Medtronic is feasible, it is unlikely that either company would want to take on J&J. Boston may make its own arguments against the deal to the FTC, but in the end we think that the transaction goes through and J&J is in fact the winner,\" Weinstein said. Credit Suisse analyst Marshall Gordon said that if a counter-bid were to emerge, it would most likely come from Medtronic. Medtronic spokesman Scott Papillon declined to comment on a possible bid. Boston Scientific and Abbott Labs were not immediately available for comment. J&J\\'s bid, he said, \"sends a strong signal about its own concerns about (J&J\\'s drug-eluting stent) Cypher being able to compete.\" Shares of J&J were up 82 cents to $67.35 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trade, while shares of Conor jumped $5.20, or 19 percent, to $32.72 on the Nasdaq.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil fell on Friday to the lowest level since June 2005 amid fund selling across commodity markets and worries of an economic slowdown in the  United States. \\n\\n High U.S. oil inventories heading into winter and selling pressure ahead of the expiry of the front-month U.S. crude contract at the close of trading fueled the selling. The expiring December U.S. crude contract settled down 45 cents at $55.81 a barrel, the lowest settlement price since June 15, 2005. The price of oil has fallen nearly 30 percent from the record high of $78.40 in July. London Brent crude for January delivery settled up 45 cents at $58.99 \"There is rising concern that we could be going into a U.S. economic slowdown,\" said Rick Mueller, senior oil analyst at consultancy ESAI. \"This fall also speaks of a well-supplied crude market and a warmer outlook in the U.S., and with those conditions maybe the market is starting to wake up to the fact that prices shouldn\\'t be near $60.\" There was also widespread talk in the market that an investment fund was in trouble and unwinding its positions. Base metals also slid on concern that global demand for raw materials would suffer if the world\\'s largest economy slows. London copper prices fell to their lowest levels since June. Thursday\\'s U.S. industrial output data for October was weak, showing signs of a cooling economy. Oil markets had traded in a roughly $58-$62 barrel range for around six weeks, the longest period of rangebound trading since the same time a year ago. While the front-month U.S. contract for December was well below that level on Friday, the second-month futures contract for oil in January was still trading near $58. That contract will become the benchmark on Monday. CONTRACT EXPIRY \"We really can\\'t ignore the fact that it is contract expiry,\" said Mueller. \"As things stand, once that contract is off the board, we\\'ll be back where we were on Monday.\" Still, some traders said prices may break below the band, dragged down by ample stocks, a relatively mild start to the U.S. winter, and doubts about whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can enforce output cuts. Lower oil prices have spurred product consumption, but warmer-than-usual weather has sapped heating oil demand. The U.S. National Weather Service on Thursday forecast warmer-than-normal weather for the U.S. Northeast, the world\\'s top heating oil market, from December until February, although other forecasts were mixed. OPEC producers agreed at an emergency meeting last month to cut supplies by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from November 1, although investors doubt the cuts will be enacted fully. OPEC this week prepared the ground for a further cut when the group next meets on output in December, citing concern about potentially large rises in inventories next spring if it continues to pump at present levels. Analysts said the market may be testing the group to find the oil price it wants to defend. For some longer-term investors who believe markets will get tighter in the years to come as suppliers struggle to meet rising demand, the fall in price represents a buy opportunity. \"I don\\'t think short-term sentiment is looking anything other than negative,\" said Mark Matthias, chief executive of British investment specialist Dawnay Day Quantum. \"But taking a three- to five-year view, I would be a buyer of oil below $60.\" (Additional reporting by  Richard Valdmanis  in New York)',\n",

Even so, concerns about signs of further weakness in the housing market restrained a broader market advance and overshadowed the boost from a second straight day of declines in crude oil prices, which helped industrial stocks such as 3M Co. ( MMM.N ). New housing starts dropped 14.6 percent in October to their lowest in more than six years while building permits fell 6.3 percent, the U.S. Commerce Department said.   \"It was a pretty bad number,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. \"Housing cuts through the economy. If housing is going to slow more, than all the rest of the sectors that support it are going to struggle.\" The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 36.74 points, or 0.30 percent, to finish at a record close of 12,342.56, which also marked its session high and a lifetime high. The Dow notched a sixth straight session of gains, its longest winning streak in a year. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  gained 1.44 points, or 0.10 percent, to end at 1,401.20. But the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 3.20 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 2,445.86. For the week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.4 percent -- marking a second straight week of gains for both. The S&P 500 finished the week up 1.5 percent. Altria shares rose 1.7 percent, or $1.44, to $85.01 on the New York Stock Exchange after a federal appeals court decided to review a lower court ruling that let a $200 billion lawsuit filed by \"light\" cigarette smokers proceed as a class action, according to a court document. The appeals court also stopped proceedings in the suit, involving Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, a unit of Altria.   OIL SLIDES BELOW $56 The drop in crude oil prices helped shares of industrial conglomerates such as diversified manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape and Post-It notes, whose stock gained 1.4 percent, or $1.11, to $81.40 on the NYSE. 3M was the Dow\\'s second-biggest advancer, behind Altria. U.S. crude oil futures ended lower but managed to pare losses to end near $56 a barrel after falling to a 17-month low in overnight electronic trading. NYMEX crude for December delivery CLZ6, which expired at the close, settled at $55.81 a barrel, down 45 cents. During earlier electronic trading, the NYMEX December crude contract dropped as low as $54.86, the lowest since June 14, 2005. TOUGH TIMES FOR HOME BUILDERS Shares of home builders such as Beazer Homes USA Inc. ( BZH.N ) fell after the housing data. Beazer\\'s shares dropped 1.8 percent, or 82 cents, to $44.07, while shares of Lennar Corp. ( LEN.N ), another U.S. home builder, slipped 0.12 percent, or 6 cents, to $49.34. Both trade on the NYSE. Fears that computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) could struggle to keep posting strong profits also kept investors on edge, limiting gains among technology shares. Hewlett-Packard\\'s stock fell 1 percent, or 39 cents, to $39.77 and was among the biggest drags on both the Dow and the S&P 500. The company also disclosed that securities regulators had elevated an investigation into the company\\'s probe of boardroom leaks.   The biggest drag on the Nasdaq was Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ), the world\\'s largest coffee shop chain. Starbucks shares fell 5.1 percent, or $2.01, to $37.42, a day after it posted a drop in quarterly profit and revenue missed estimates. Volume was active on the NYSE, where about 1.70 billion shares changed hands, above last year\\'s daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.79 billion shares were traded, slightly below last year\\'s daily average of 1.80 billion. Decliners narrowly outnumbered advancers on the NYSE, where 1,735 stocks fell and 1,566 shares rose. On the Nasdaq, the negative breadth was more pronounced, with 1,741 stocks falling and 1,275 shares rising.',\n",

Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, Texas, was not immediately available to comment.

But I might get tempted to open it up,\" Iracheta told Reuters. With supplies of the PS3 expected to be extremely limited and stores not guaranteeing that they\\'ll be able to immediately deliver all preorders, Iracheta isn\\'t 100 percent sure he\\'ll be the first on his block with PS3 bragging rights -- he was the fifth person in line. Legions of North American video game addicts are camped out of in front of electronics retailers, awaiting the release of Sony Corp.\\'s ( 6758.T )( SNE.N ) PS3 -- as the clock ticks down on the start of the latest round in the battle for dominance in the $30 billion global video game industry. Sony\\'s predecessor PlayStation 2 -- which has sold 106 million consoles globally since its debut in 2000, grabbing 70 percent of global market share -- entranced both teens and young adults with its lifelike, interactive graphics. The PS3 is Sony\\'s long-awaited successor, boasting eye-popping new graphics and beefed up power. The console, along with rivals, is expected to boost the massive video game market to as much as $44 billion in sales by 2011, according to DFC Intelligence. FLIPPING FOR PROFIT Some gamers with preorders in hand hope to profit from the frenzy by flipping a PS3 -- which sells for $500 or $600 depending on the size of the hard drive -- to fund their increasingly expensive video game habits. Microsoft Corp.\\'s ( MSFT.O ) next-generation Xbox 360 consoles were up for auction on eBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ) almost as soon as they debuted in stores a year ago -- often at double the store price. And history is repeating itself with the PS3 launch. As of Thursday morning, 2,297 PS3s had sold on eBay at an average price of $1,608 and 698 additional units were still up for bid, according to data from eBay. Nintendo Co. Ltd.\\'s 7974.OS Wii, which debuts on Sunday with a $250 retail price, is also a hot commodity on eBay where 2,187 have sold so far at an average price of $550 and 156 remain up for sale. Having grappled with Xbox 360 sellers who were unable to get their presale unit to buyers and to fend off fraudulent listings, eBay has established new rules. Among other things, sellers must be highly rated and can only list one PS3 or one Wii per eBay account before the launch dates. Sellers also must show a photo of their preorder receipt. DOUBLY LUCKY California college student John Nam, a console collector and aspiring game developer, has reservations for the Wii and the PS3 -- and plans to keep them both. \"Let\\'s just say my mom is really nice to me,\" joked Nam, 20, who nabbed his PS3 preorder after locating a store he thought other gamers would overlook. \"And I\\'m not going to sell it. And my wallet will cry.\" During the 15-hour wait, he and others took turns holding spots so people could catch some shut-eye in their cars. But for every hardcore gamer with the money to take the PS3 plunge early, there are several others who are forced to wait. Vancouver-based visual effects artist Albert Ferrer has been wanting to play the latest \"Virtua Fighter\" game on the PS3 since he got a taste of it at the E3 trade show in May, but he is buying the Wii instead. \"I don\\'t have enough money to buy a PS3\" said Ferrer, 23, who plans to hold off his purchase until spring. Ferrer said he passed on Microsoft Corp.\\'s ( MSFT.O ) Xbox 360 console even though it came out a year ago -- citing a preference for the games on the Sony consoles. \"I told myself I can\\'t buy all three,\" Ferrer said.',\n",

In addition, analysts said a Moscow newspaper reporting on the possibility of a deal between Severstal and U.S. Steel had pushed up shares. The takeover talk has prompted many investors to aggressively seek upside calls to bet on further gains in the stock, Foster said. The demand for options has also pushed up U.S. Steel options volatility, as investors brace for a big stock move. More than 110,000 contracts had changed hands in U.S. Steel in the U.S. options market by mid-afternoon, way above its normal volume of 15,250 contracts, according to market research firm Track Data. U.S. Steel declined to comment. Meanwhile, shares of the company, which has been the subject of takeover rumors for months, rose $5.61, or 8.7 percent, to $70.21 in New York Stock Exchange trading. At one point, the stock traded as high as $71.82. Steel has become attractive as prices have been on the rise due to strong demand both domestically and abroad. \"Overall, the steel group is up today trading very actively, as there are rumors circulating that a takeover might occur in this sector,\" said William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. The stock rise also comes on a day when Brazil\\'s Companhia Siderurgica Nacional ( CSNA3.SA ) ( SID.N ) said that it has approached Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus Group CS.L CS.AX with a takeover offer.

A source at Metalloinvest told Kommersant the company is holding \"broad consultations on the market\" and has picked a likely partner for a merger, the paper said. \"We understood that we will get the highest synergy effect from a merger with Severstal because we both produce thick steel plate for the construction industry.

The paper quoted analysts as saying the merged company would have a market value of $20 billion.

       "  ' HANOI  (Reuters) - Shareholders in wireless technology firm Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) support the legal fights that have depressed their stock holdings and oppose a company split that may ringfence the risks, Chief Executive Paul Jacobs said on Friday. \\n\\n \"We have a very low turnover in our shareholder base. All those people are coming up to us and saying look, you know, we\\'ve just got to win this last battle. Keep fighting the fight,\" he told Reuters in an interview. Asked if the shareholders want the company, also a chip supplier, to stay as one entity, he said: \"That\\'s their preference.\" Some of the world\\'s biggest wireless technology firms have complained to regulators that Qualcomm charges too much to license patents for third-generation equipment. Opponents in legal disputes include mobile phone firm Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ). Jacobs has previously raised the possibility of a splitting the firm in two to protect risk-averse shareholders from the legal issues. \"If that\\'s what we need to do that\\'s what we need to do, but the company actually works pretty well as it is,\" he said on the sidelines of the APEC CEO summit in Hanoi. Qualcomm dominates the market for CDMA wireless technology. Jacobs said a new type of high-speed, 3G standard technology, called OFDMA and developed by Flarion Technologies, which it bought this year, would start field trials at the beginning of 2007. The chip set stage should take place in 2008 and \"the beginning of 2009 will be the full rollout,\" he said. SKILL SHORTAGE Scarcity of skilled staff has become a major issue for the company, which employs about 11,500 people, mostly in high-paying engineering jobs, said the 44-year-old executive who joined the firm in 1990 as a development engineer. He said the scarcity should not affect future growth \"but it certainly affects the bottom line in the sense that we are probably spending 20 percent of revenue right now on R&D.\" In Vietnam, where Qualcomm has an equity stake in the country\\'s first manufacturer of CDMA handsets, Jacobs said the prospects for cellphone growth are strong. \"The market here is relatively low penetration at this point so there\\'s a good opportunity for very significant growth as the price of handsets comes down and the price of services comes down.\"',\n",
       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Foot Locker Inc. ( FL.N ) denied on Friday that it was exploring a potential sale of the company, quashing hopes by some investors who had banked on profit-taking, and shares fell as much as 6 percent. \\n\\n Speculation of a buyout of the world\\'s largest retailer of athletic shoes and apparel has simmered since the spring. It was heightened by the company\\'s hiring of an advisory firm in August and by Foot Locker\\'s refusal to comment on any buyout interest. On Friday, Chief Executive Matthew Serra dispelled the rumors on a conference call with analysts, a day after the company posted third quarter results that narrowly beat Wall Street earnings and sales estimates. \"The continued rumors in the press regarding Foot Locker being involved in discussions of a potential sale of the company are not true,\" said Serra. \"There are no discussions taking place, nor have there been.\" Serra told analysts that Foot Locker had hired Evercore Partners to advise it on a range of matters and strategic consulting firm the Parthenon Group to assist it in reviewing its business plan. Susquehanna Financial analyst John Shanley, who rates the stock \"positive,\" said that now that a sale was not in sight, the company will have to be judged on its own merits. Foot Locker has a dominant market share in the United States but its profit has been crimped by weak European sales \"There isn\\'t any incentive on the part of potential investors to look for a richer multiple being paid for the company,\" Shanley said. \"You\\'re seeing a lot of the momentum people that jumped into the stock with the expectation they\\'d see a quick profit, they\\'re the ones bailing out today.\" WILL \"FOOTQUARTERS\" TAP INTO HIGHER MARGIN BUSINESS? On the conference call, Serra detailed plans for a new lower-priced chain of family footwear called \"Footquarters\" that the company hopes will be able to tap into the $25 billion dress and casual shoe business. Approximately 60 percent of merchandise will be athletic shoes, with the rest dress and casual shoes, which carry higher profit margins than the athletic business. The company plans to open up to 70 stores in 2007, with the first group to open in April or May and the second in the fall. \"We feel that our buying power in the athletic segment will give us enhanced margins versus our competition, so I personally believe it could be a very large division,\" said Serra, adding that the business could eventually expand to Canada, Mexico and Central America. Analyst Shanley said the dress and casual business hinges much more on strong merchandise styling than in the athletic shoe business. \"It\\'s a very competitive (business), very fast-moving and very different from what Foot Locker currently has in its merchandise mix,\" Shanley said. \"It\\'s a very different animal.\" Foot Locker is also opening a chain of athletic hat stores called \"Champs Sports Just Hats,\" that Shanley said would try to steal market share from Genesco Inc.\\'s ( GCO.N ) successful Hat World chain. That business has operating profit margins of 12 percent to 13 percent, higher than the average for specialty retail, he said. \"They (Foot Locker) see the numbers that Hat World is doing for Genesco and see this as an opportunity.\" Shanley said. Shares of Footlocker trade at 14 times 2008 earnings, at a premium to Genesco at 13 times forward-looking earnings, but below rival Finish Line Inc. ( FINL.O ) at 16.5. Foot Locker shares were down 90 cents, or nearly 4 percent, to $23.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Martinne Geller )',\n",

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) said on Friday that it has no plans to take cues from other retailers and sell its credit card business because it generates big profits and drives stronger store sales. \\n\\n The discount retailer, which offers both a Target Visa and another card that can be used only at its stores, is among the top 10 credit card issuers in the United States. The business contributed nearly 22 percent of Target\\'s third-quarter earnings before taxes, but some on Wall Street have urged the retailer to sell the business to reduce risk. Analysts have raised concerns that a slowing housing market and recent regulations that increased minimum credit card payment amounts could lead to an increase in bad debt. Chains including Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N and Kohl\\'s Corp. ( KSS.N ) have recently sold their credit card portfolios. \"We have no intention of following this path,\" Doug Scovanner, Target\\'s chief financial officer, said in a presentation to investors on Friday. \"For those of you who perceive a high degree of risk in our operations (because of) this enterprise...selling these operations is not going to eliminate that perception,\" he said. Target said the credit card operations not only generate fat returns, but also encourage customers to shop more. The retailer said customers, on average, spend nearly $200 on their first purchase with the Target Visa card to take advantage of a 10 percent discount. Cardholders also receive 10 percent off coupons when they charge $1,000 at Target stores, or $2,000 elsewhere, and the overwhelming majority redeem them, generating sales growth. Target said it turns down some 45 percent of those who apply for a Visa card, and its cardholders have unusually high credit scores. Target\\'s biggest rival, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) has applied to open a bank like Target\\'s, but its application is on hold as Congress and federal regulators debate the potential risk of allowing non-banking companies to open banks. Target said that situation should have no effect on its financial services business.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Thousands camped outside stores on Friday to be among the first U.S. buyers of Sony Corp.\\'s new PlayStation 3 video game player, but violence marred the debut when one man was shot in a robbery attempt. \\n\\n He was one of 15 to 20 people waiting outside a Connecticut Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ) to buy PlayStations at about 3:15 a.m. EST when they were confronted by two armed men who demanded money, police said. The man was shot when he refused to give them money. He was in serious condition at a Massachusetts hospital, police said. Unruly crowds prompted the closure of two Wal-Mart stores in Palmdale, California, earlier in the week and skirmishes broke out in front of other U.S. stores as nerves wore thin for shoppers, some of whom had camped out for several days. But in many cities, with hundreds of gamers waiting outside stores, the wait turned into a social event. Finger food was showered upon weary shoppers outside Sony\\'s midtown Manhattan store, while thumping music blared. Some turned discarded bags of shredded office paper into billowy chairs and a lamp shade sheltered one man from the rain. Investors are closely watching the PS3 launch as a key test of Sony\\'s grip on the $30 billion gaming industry, particularly as it faces rising competition from rivals at Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) and Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974.OS. Sony is expected to rake in millions of dollars in revenue on Friday alone, with about 400,000 units expected to be available, one week after the initial launch in Japan. Data on how many consoles had been sold was not immediately available. Depending on the hard drive, each PS3 sells for either $500 or $600 and Sony aims to make 1 million units available in the United States by the end of the year. On Friday, hundreds of new PS3 owners made their own profit by reselling their $600 machines on Internet auction site eBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ). As of midday, 564 had sold for an average price of $2,711, and 2,037 more units were on offer, according to eBay Marketplace Research. Outlying bids reached $30,000. The video game shopping frenzy will be capped this weekend by the debut of Nintendo\\'s much-anticipated Wii console on Sunday. Some industry watchers predict the lines outside stores could be bigger than those that formed for the PS3 launch. PS3 PARTY KEY TO TURNAROUND The PS3 buzz is a welcome break after a tough year for Sony, following a recall of nearly 10 million of its computer batteries, delays in the PS3 and a growing price war in the flat-screen TV market. Sony ( 6758.T )( SNE.N ) shares closed 1.3 percent higher at 4,770 yen in Tokyo on Friday. Sony is expected to lose money at first on each PS3 sale. The unit can also be used to surf the Internet, download video and music and play movies with a Blu-ray high-definition disc drive. But high production costs have dragged Sony\\'s game unit into a deep loss for the year through March. Experts suggest each PS3 could last 10 years and go a long way toward helping Sony stay atop the gaming market, as well as make Blu-ray the standard for next-generation DVDs. \"Gaming is our primary focus, but the PS3 does so much that it can become the centerpiece of a home entertainment system,\" Kaz Hirai, chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment America, said in an interview. Some analysts say the PS3\\'s high price could deter non-gaming consumers and open Sony up to stronger competition from Microsoft\\'s Xbox 360 and Nintendo\\'s Wii. \"They will sell out of the 400,000 (units), with the hard-core gamers,\" said IDC analyst Danielle Levitas. \"But with Blu-ray, they are betting their strongest business unit on a technology that it\\'s not clear most consumers want.\" Only about 500 PS3s were available for sale at the midnight Friday launch in New York, officials said, leaving hundreds out in the rain holding on to promises that more boxes would be made available when the store reopened at dawn. In Boston, police were called in to turn away hundreds of gamers waiting at a Best Buy store after it turned out the outlet did not have a permit to open at midnight. Angel Paredes, who waited four days through rain storms in New York, was the first to buy a PS3 in the United States, and vowed he would not put it up for sale. Kamau Romero, 24, an educator, who was No. 3 on the line, was not so certain. \"It would take a lot to get it out of my hands, but it is possible. You never know,\" Romero said.

The stay in the case, sought by Philip Morris, was issued as of Thursday, the court order said. Defendants in the case include Altria Group Inc.\\'s ( MO.N ) Philip Morris USA unit; Reynolds American Inc.\\'s ( RAI.N ) R.J. Reynolds tobacco Co.; Loews Corp.\\'s LTR.N Lorillard Tobacco unit CG.N; Vector Group Ltd.\\'s ( VGR.N ) Liggett Group; and British American Tobacco Plc\\'s ( BATS.L ) British American Tobacco (Investments) Ltd. In September, U.S. Senior District Judge Jack Weinstein in Brooklyn, New York, granted class-action status in the case, which would have allowed the suit to go forward on behalf of all U.S. \"light\" cigarette smokers. The suit argued that tobacco companies defrauded smokers into thinking light cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes. Lawyers for the smokers argued that lights brought tobacco companies between $120 billion and $200 billion in extra sales. Attorneys for the tobacco companies countered that there was no way to tell how many people relied on the word \"light\" when choosing cigarettes, and said the smokers could not be grouped together as a class action. Shares of Altria, maker of the top-selling Marlboro brand, closed up $1.44, or 1.7 percent, at a new 52-week closing high of $85.01 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. \"I expect the class will eventually be decertified; this is a first indication of that eventuality,\" said Charles Norton, co-portfolio manager of Mutuals Advisors Inc.\\'s Vice Fund, which owns shares in tobacco companies.

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc. on Thursday said it had acquired Bix.com, a site that helps users arrange contests to rate others\\' photos, video or singing, in a move to promote more popular participation across Yahoo sites. \\n\\n Bix is a 16-person company headed by Mike Speiser, who co-founded dot-com-era start-up Epinions.com, which first popularized the idea that polling user opinions could work as a tool to help individuals find personally relevant information. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Contests on Bix ( www.bix.com ) range from rating creative undertakings like karaoke, dance, photography or writing to \"Hot or Not\" beauty contests, where participants judge others on looks. \"Anyone can come and create a competition, both individuals or corporations,\" Speiser said in a phone interview. \"These are user-generated contests, not just user-generated content.\" Bix is one of a new crop of Web sites that encourage user self-expression, by enabling people to try their hand at making short video or audio recordings. Toward that end, it has video- and audio-recording tools that work with computers connected to a low-cost Webcam device, cameraphone or digital video camera. Founded only in January of this year, Bix is the latest in a string of social media sites Yahoo has acquired including photo-sharing site Flickr, shared bookmarking site del.icio.us, group calendar Upcoming.org, and video editing site Jumpcut. Popularity contests have taken off over the past year as a way for members of social network sites like News Corp.\\'s MySpace to identify people who share their interests. Since Bix was formally introduced in early August, the site has attracted more than one million users, Speiser said. Contests can be initiated by Bix members, or by corporate sponsors. In one example of its utility for advertisers, amusement part operator Six Flags asked people to submit their best impersonation of a roller-coaster scream. Details can be found at  www.bix.com/sixflags/. Organizers call the shots by defining the nature of a competition, setting deadlines, and selecting who participates. Winners are selected by the largest vote tally. In coming months, users will be able to set up and run Bix contests on other sites such as MySpace or Facebook as well as various Yahoo sites, rather than having to go to the Bix site. Speiser will join Yahoo as a vice president in charge of community-oriented sites like Yahoo Groups and Yahoo Photos. Bradley Horowitz, Yahoo vice president of product strategy, said his company was looking at how Bix might be used in conjunction with other Yahoo sites include instant-messaging, video and other entertainment sites.',\n",
       "  ' BEIJING  (Reuters) - The head of the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE said on Saturday the company will target cost cuts of $1,000 per vehicle through increased outsourcing outside of North America and other savings. \\n\\n \"We are willing to import, with the focus on being competitive,\" Chrysler head Tom LaSorda told reporters at the Beijing International Automotive Exhibition. He said that over the next six to 12 months, the company would identify cost reductions averaging $1,000 per vehicle, with part of that coming from outsourcing. He did not specify where the outsourcing would be done, saying \"we are going to source where we can get good low-cost components and high quality.\" LaSorda did not comment on whether layoffs would be a part of the cost savings as they have been at Ford and GM. Chrysler\\'s parent, the world\\'s fifth-biggest car maker, maintained its 2006 profit forecast after strong third-quarter profits at Mercedes and its truck business helped absorb a 1.16 billion euro ($1.46 billion) loss at Chrysler. LaSorda also said the company would focus on increasing sales outside of North America, where it has typically generated 85-91 percent of sales. \"Others have been more aggressive in Asia, we have to pick up the pace,\" he said. Separately, LaSorda noted that the company was in talks with China\\'s Chery and one other non-Chinese company about a production alliance to build a small fuel-efficient car, but he gave no further details. Chrysler currently has no offerings in the small-car segment, which is growing in the United States and represents a larger share of sales in Europe and other markets. Executives said the company was developing more right-hand drive models as well as diesel models to boost its competitiveness in international markets. The group was rigorously reviewing what steps were needed to rescue profits at Chrysler while it launches a string of fuel-efficient cars to energy-conscious buyers. U.S. rivals General Motors ( GM.N ) and Ford ( F.N ) have also struggled in their home market as Asian car makers claim market share by offering fuel-efficient alternatives to the pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles Detroit has come to love.',\n",
       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Sportscar maker Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ) does not plan to make a full takeover bid for Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), in which it is already the biggest shareholder, German magazine Focus reported on Saturday. \\n\\n Focus said Ferdinand Piech, whose family owns Porsche and who is also supervisory board chairman of VW, had told other members of the VW board he did not intend to take over Europe\\'s biggest carmaker. Focus did not give a source for its report. Porsche said this week it had raised its stake to 27.4 percent and aimed to increase it to as much as 29.9 percent. A 30-percent stake would trigger a compulsory takeover bid. It also said it planned to create authorized capital worth around 8 billion euros ($10 billion) as a possible acquisition currency. VW shares hit an eight-year high, taking the company\\'s market capitalization to about 28 billion euros. Focus said Porsche\\'s owners did not want to take the financial risks that would be involved in a takeover bid. Volkswagen declined to comment on the report, and Porsche was not immediately available. Last week, the VW supervisory board effectively unseated CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder and replaced him with Piech\\'s closest ally, Audi boss Martin Winterkorn, in a coup that was widely interpreted as a power grab by Piech. In an interview released on Saturday, the state premier of Lower Saxony, which is VW\\'s second-biggest shareholder, called for an end to the power struggle within VW. \"There must finally be an end to the power games,\" Christian Wulff told the Bild am Sonntag in an interview, due to be published on Sunday. Wulff, who has often crossed swords with Piech, said he would be against Porsche CEO Windelin Wiedeking\\'s succeeding Piech as supervisory board chief next year. \"That would go against my opinion that we should remain fair to all our shareholders,\" Wulff said. \"Large shareholders like the state of Lower Saxony and Porsche shouldn\\'t compete for the supervisory board leadership, in my view.\" Porsche began acquiring VW shares just over a year ago, when it bought an 18.5-percent stake. At the time, the companies said the move would cement their cooperation. Germany\\'s financial regulator said on Saturday it had referred a case of suspected insider dealing in Porsche shares before the announcement to state prosecutors. A spokesman for the watchdog, BaFin, confirmed a report in Wirtschaftswoche magazine that the investigation had been passed on to the Frankfurt state prosecutor. The Frankfurt prosecutor could not immediately be reached for comment. According to the magazine report, a fund manager for a foreign firm was suspected of having known that Porsche was about to buy the stake, and sold 15 million euros\\' worth of Porsche shares. In the event, Porsche shares gained in value and are now worth about 50 percent more than they were at that time.',\n",

LU.N in an $11.8 billion deal, the White House said on Friday. \\n\\n The move came despite some lawmakers\\' concerns about safeguards for classified work that Lucent\\'s Bell Laboratories conducts for the U.S. government. The companies have promised to create a separate unit run by Americans to handle sensitive U.S. contracts. \"Alcatel and Lucent have agreed with U.S. government agencies to enter into two robust and far-reaching agreements designed to ensure the protection of our national security,\" White House spokesman Tony Snow said in a statement released in Hanoi, where Bush is attending an economic summit. He said those agreements were a strict condition for the administration\\'s approval of the deal. The combination would create one of the world\\'s biggest suppliers of network hardware and software for mobile and high-speed Internet communications, with $25 billion in annual revenue. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) spent 75 days investigating the national security implications of the transaction. The interagency panel recommended Bush approve it and he acted before the statutory deadline on Tuesday. Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican and the outgoing chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, had questioned whether the classified work Lucent did for the government could be adequately protected with the safeguards announced. Hunter had sought more information after a lengthy briefing on Tuesday by senior executives from the two companies as well as U.S. Treasury Department and Pentagon officials. A spokesman for the lawmaker was not immediately available for comment. Lucent\\'s government contracts include an advanced communications system for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon\\'s technology incubator. The company has unclassified government contracts as well. During its 80-year history, Bell Labs pioneered work on technologies such as the UNIX computer operating system and the laser. The companies said they welcomed clearing the final regulatory hurdle. \"We are now working quickly to finalize the merger transaction, and expect to close the merger by November 30,\" they said in a statement. Lucent Chief Executive Officer Patricia Russo will serve as CEO of the newly combined company, which will be based in Paris. The companies have already received approval from shareholders as well as U.S. and EU antitrust authorities. The issue of foreign acquisitions of U.S.-owned assets was pushed to the forefront during the past year after a Chinese state-controlled company, CNOOC Ltd., unsuccessfully tried to buy oil and gas company Unocal. Additional uproar followed when the Arab firm Dubai Ports World tried to buy some operations at key U.S. ports. It later agreed to sell those assets to an American entity after complaints from many in Congress.

The real test of the U.S. shopper\\'s staying power will come on \"Black Friday,\" the unofficial kickoff of the Christmas shopping season. Earnings releases also slow down to a trickle next week, with only six Standard & Poor\\'s 500 components set to report results. Among the most closely watched will be upscale department store chain Nordstrom Inc. ( JWN.N ), which releases its quarterly scorecard on Monday.

No. 2 home improvement chain Lowe\\'s Companies Inc. ( LOW.N ) is another key company also expected to report results on Monday. Shares of home builders and related companies were battered this week after Lowe\\'s rival Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) and housewares retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc.( WSM.N ) both cut their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, blaming a slowdown in the U.S. housing market. SIGNALS FROM THE BOND MARKET Adding to housing-sector woes was a report on Friday showing October had the sharpest decline in housing starts since 2000. But its impact may not weigh heavily on the market since some investors consider it positive for stocks if the housing slowdown pushes the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy and cut interest rates. \"The Street has a very short memory, and there\\'s a tremendous bullish bias, but bonds have been telling the opposite story,\" said Gary Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling & Co., an investment research firm in Springfield, New Jersey. \"Bonds are telling you: \\'Not only is the Fed through with raising rates, but we\\'ve probably got economic weakness.\\' My suspicion is that bonds have it right,\" Shilling added. \"Yes, interest rates are going down, but the damage to profits more than offsets that.\" Normal trading hours are in effect next week from Monday through Wednesday, with the stock market closed on Thursday and shutting early on Friday. The bond market\\'s early closing on Wednesday may mean many stock players also will leave early for the long holiday weekend. \"Next week is going to be a slow week unless there\\'s some sort of geopolitical action, which could maybe move the market,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. \"In a slow week, if there\\'s some sort of big news, the move could be much more volatile than usual because volume will be light.\" Other economic releases include the index of leading U.S. economic indicators for October on Monday and the weekly mortgage market index on Wednesday.

       "  ' MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Financial leaders from top developed and emerging economies expressed confidence in growth prospects on Saturday, but tensions emerged over foreign exchange rates and nagging trade imbalances. \\n\\n Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 (G20) met to tackle a range of economic flashpoints, from stalled trade talks to oil prices to China\\'s yuan. Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, whose country is hosting the event, said ministers were optimistic as the United States, Europe and Japan were all expanding. \"There was an agreement that the prospects for the global economy are very strong,\" Costello told reporters after a break in the first day\\'s sessions. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Rodrigo Rato, said healthy global growth was on track although he pointed to the need for continued vigilance on inflation. As ministers and central bankers met, a small group of protesters clashed with police in Australia\\'s second city, overturning barricades and storming a police riot truck. They smashed the truck\\'s windows and threw bottles at police. About 5,000 people marched in the streets shouting slogans such as \"Stop G20\" in an otherwise peaceful day of protest. The finance chiefs themselves did not clash publicly but there were signs of tension on the most contentious issue up for discussion -- China\\'s currency and growing trade imbalances. Critics of China, particularly from the United States, have charged that Beijing keeps the currency unfairly cheap to boost exports and this increases trade imbalances. China revalued the yuan by 2.1 percent in July 2005 and cut it from a decade-old dollar peg. It has since risen nearly another 3 percent. But Costello said no country had said it believed its currency was undervalued, a tacit sign that China had not accepted complaints that the yuan was too weak. \"Some feel their currencies are a little high, but none felt their currencies were too low,\" he said. PROGRESS ON YUAN U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt had said ahead of the meeting he expected to discuss the yuan with China\\'s central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan. Zhou, in a briefing, said he had not felt pressure from other countries and added China was in a better position to press ahead with foreign exchange reform, including more yuan flexibility. \"Up to now, there\\'s no pressure,\" Zhou said, when asked whether he expected calls for movement on the yuan. The head of the People\\'s Bank of China said the country\\'s financial sector was much stronger than three or four years ago, making it easier for firms to accept currency and interest rate reforms. As China has posted record trade surpluses, its foreign reserve stockpile has surged to more than $1 trillion, creating a fresh worry for economic leaders: the possibility that it would diversify out of the dollar and trigger wild currency swings. Zhou said the central bank began diversifying its reserves years ago after the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, but he said he could not be specific about the makeup of reserves. \"I am sorry to say we don\\'t disclose details in diversification,\" he said, saying only that China sought to have safety and liquidity while still achieving reasonable returns. INFLATION AND OIL Rato of the IMF focused on the risk of inflation, despite the past few months\\' declines in the price of oil. \"We see a need for central bankers, not only in industrialized countries but certainly in emerging ones, to be extremely vigilant on inflationary pressures.\" Rato said he saw no sign oil prices would fall any time soon, a warning underscored by a new report from U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers that saw crude prices averaging about $72 a barrel next year, well above current levels below  $60. Crude oil prices, driven in part by rapid industrialization in China and India, reached a record near $80 a barrel OILOIL this year before retreating. Rato also said the longer prices stay high the greater the inflationary risks and the more it will sap domestic spending power. \"We see very strong demand, and strong demand will continue, not only in China and India, but in the developed countries.\" Rato said stronger-than-expected growth in the euro zone was helping offset a slowing in the United States and he saw room for further tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB). \"We see a need for the monetary authorities in Europe to move toward neutrality but we do not see a need for a restrictive monetary policy, certainly not now,\" he said. The ECB, whose benchmark rate is 3.25 percent, is expected to raise rates to 3.5 percent next month, a level that many analysts say is the beginning of a neutral range. The IMF forecasts 5.1 percent global growth in 2006 and 4.9 percent growth in 2007, marking a fifth year of the best economic growth in a generation. (Additional reporting by  Michael Perry )',\n",
       "  ' MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - The head of the IMF on Saturday gave an upbeat reading on the world economy but warned of inflationary risks, as financial leaders wrestled with economic flashpoints ranging from currency levels to free trade. \\n\\n Rodrigo Rato, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said at a meeting of the Group of 20 economic powers that healthy global growth was on track, but he warned central bankers must be on high alert to tackle inflationary dangers. \"We see a need for central bankers, not only in industrialized countries but certainly in emerging ones, to be extremely vigilant on inflationary pressures,\" Rato told a briefing ahead of a two-day G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs. Rato said he sees no sign that oil prices will fall any time soon. His warning was underscored by a report from a prominent bank, released as G20 leaders gathered. U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers forecast crude prices would continue to ratchet upward through 2007 and said next year Brent crude oil would average about $72 a barrel, sharply higher than current levels below $60. Rato said one of the risks to global output is an abrupt decline in the U.S. economy triggered by a U.S. housing slowdown, but currently he does not expect that to happen. \"What we see right now is not a sharp deceleration. For the Federal Reserve there is still a risk of inflation and for this (risk) to materialize,\" he said. The Fed has raised interest rates by 4.25 percentage points to 5.25 percent over the past two years, but has paused since its last rate rise in June to evaluate the state of the economy. CHINA IN SPOTLIGHT The meeting brings together officials from a diverse group of countries, including the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Indonesia. Host country Australia said on Friday China\\'s currency was likely to feature in the meeting and U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt said he expected the yuan to come up in a meeting with the head of China\\'s central bank. But a Chinese finance ministry official told Reuters that a draft communique from the meeting, which was still being worked on, did not mention the yuan. Critics charge China has been slow to allow a stronger yuan as the country is posting record trade surpluses and has built up a foreign exchange stockpile that tops an estimated $1 trillion. China says it will only move on the yuan when it believes it prudent and Beijing argues the United States also needs to save more to help tackle trade imbalances. China revalued the yuan, or renminbi, by 2.1 percent in July 2005 and cut it from a decade-old dollar peg. Since then it has risen nearly another three percent. Rato said stronger-than-expected growth in the euro zone was helping offset a slowing in the United States and he saw room for further tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB). \"We see a need for the monetary authorities in Europe to move toward neutrality but we do not see a need for a restrictive monetary policy, certainly not now,\" he said. The ECB, whose benchmark rate is 3.25 percent, is expected to raise rates to 3.5 percent in December, a level that many analysts say is the beginning of a neutral range. Rato gave a cautious assessment of Japan. \"Inflation data are still relatively weak,\" he said. \"Recent (data) has shown the economy is growing at a good rhythm, but domestic demand is not as strong as we would like.\" The Bank of Japan has raised interest rates to 0.25 percent from virtually zero and markets are speculating on the timing of a fresh tightening, which many believe will be early in 2007. The IMF is forecasting 5.1 percent global growth in 2006 and 4.9 percent growth in 2007, marking a fifth year of the best economic growth in a generation. ENERGY, PROTESTS The G20 meeting is also expected to focus on energy. Crude oil prices, driven in part by rapid industrialization in China and India, reached a record high near $80 a barrel OILOIL this year before retreating to trade on Friday below $56 a barrel. Rato said the longer prices stay high the greater the inflationary risks and the more it will sap domestic spending power. \"We see very strong demand, and strong demand will continue, not only in China and India, but in the developed countries.\" The meeting drew protests from about 5,000 people who marched up to police barricades set up about 150 meters away from the building where the talks took place. Protesters, shouting slogans such as \"Stop G20\" and \"Troops out of Iraq\", skirmished with police. (Additional reporting by  Michael Perry )',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Silicone breast implants will be widely available in the United States for the first time in 14 years after U.S. health officials approved sales by two companies on Friday. \\n\\n Mentor Corp. and Allergan Inc. each must study the implant risks in 40,000 women for 10 years, the Food and Drug Administration said. Silicone breast implants were banned for most U.S. women in 1992 after some complained the devices leaked and made them chronically ill. FDA officials said the companies had provided \"reasonable assurance of the benefits and risks\" that would enable women to make informed decisions. \"We now have a good understanding of what complications can occur and at what rates. We also know that women who get these devices will probably need to have additional breast implant surgery at least once,\" said Dr. Daniel Schultz, director of FDA\\'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Breast pain, hardening of the area around the implant, change in nipple sensation, implant rupture and the need for additional surgery all were reported in the companies\\' studies, the FDA said. Still, most women said they were happy with the implants. Mentor\\'s data tracked women with implants for about three years, while Allergan\\'s followed women for four years, the FDA said. Independent research over the past decade has found no convincing evidence that breast implants were associated with connective tissue diseases or cancer, the FDA said. The manufacturers\\' post-approval studies are expected to further examine those issues. Opponents criticized the FDA approval, saying complications were likely for most women and long-term risks were unknown. \"The FDA\\'s standards for implants has reached a new low with this decision,\" said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families. Zuckerman added that the FDA \"has an absolutely terrible track record in terms of enforcing post-market studies.\" Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said the approval \"appears to be yet another example of the FDA dismissing scientific evidence in order to appease corporate interests.\" \"When Congress reconvenes next session, it must examine the agency\\'s approval process and ensure that the FDA makes decisions based on science and not on corporate and political considerations,\" DeLauro said. The safety controversy had left saline-filled breast implants as the only option for most U.S. women since sales limits were put in place in 1992. Silicone versions had been available only through research studies for cancer survivors and others needing reconstruction or implant replacements. Plastic surgeons say women prefer the silicone ones. \"They feel natural. They look more natural,\" said Dr. Scott Spear, an Allergan consultant and chairman of plastic surgery at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington. Silicone implants were approved for cosmetic use in women ages 22 and older and for breast reconstruction in women of all ages. The FDA said most implant ruptures cause no symptoms and therefore women would need regular MRI exams to see if their devices remained intact. \"The cost of MRI screening over a woman\\'s lifetime may exceed the cost of her initial surgery and may not be covered by medical insurance,\" the FDA said. Silicone breast implants are among the most extensively studied medical devices, the FDA\\'s Schultz said. Allergan President Michael Ball said \"science has prevailed\" in the FDA approval, which would give U.S. women the same options others around the world had for years. Allergan\\'s saline and silicone breast implant sales were about $230 million globally in 2005, Ball said. The silicone approval should lead to double-digit growth of the market, he said. Mentor Chief Executive Joshua Levine said in a statement the approval was \"a historic moment\" for the company but he did not provide sales estimates.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) said on Friday it had been contacted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information about its recent restatement of financial results. \\n\\n The automaker said in a statement that it is \"voluntarily cooperating\" with the \"informal inquiries\" from the agency\\'s Division of Corporation Finance and the Division of Enforcement. On Tuesday, Ford restated results from the last five years to correctly account for interest rate derivatives used to hedge longer-term debt. Ford said the SEC wants more information about its third quarter report for 2006 and its annual report for 2005 as well as other data. In its restatement, Ford reported a net loss of $5.25 billion in the third quarter, an improvement of about $550 million from the preliminary results released in October. Net income for 2005 was reduced by $600 million to $1.4 billion, the company said in its restatement. Ford also on Friday amended earnings for the first half of this year, saying it lost $1.74 billion compared to the previously reported loss of $1.44 billion.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose to yet another record close on Friday as investors snapped up shares of Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) after a court decided to review a multibillion-dollar case involving the company\\'s cigarette-making unit. \\n\\n The jump of nearly 2 percent in Altria\\'s stock propelled the Dow  .DJI  to its 18th record close since the start of October and helped underpin the S&P 500\\'s finish above the 1,400 mark for the first time in six years. Even so, concerns about signs of further weakness in the housing market restrained a broader market advance and overshadowed the boost from a second straight day of declines in crude oil prices, which helped industrial stocks such as 3M Co. ( MMM.N ). New housing starts dropped 14.6 percent in October to their lowest in more than six years while building permits fell 6.3 percent, the U.S. Commerce Department said.   \"It was a pretty bad number,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. \"Housing cuts through the economy. If housing is going to slow more, than all the rest of the sectors that support it are going to struggle.\" The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 36.74 points, or 0.30 percent, to finish at a record close of 12,342.56, which also marked its session high and a lifetime high. The Dow notched a sixth straight session of gains, its longest winning streak in a year. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  gained 1.44 points, or 0.10 percent, to end at 1,401.20. But the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 3.20 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 2,445.86. For the week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.4 percent -- marking a second straight week of gains for both. The S&P 500 finished the week up 1.5 percent. Altria shares rose 1.7 percent, or $1.44, to $85.01 on the New York Stock Exchange after a federal appeals court decided to review a lower court ruling that let a $200 billion lawsuit filed by \"light\" cigarette smokers proceed as a class action, according to a court document. The appeals court also stopped proceedings in the suit, involving Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, a unit of Altria.   OIL SLIDES BELOW $56 The drop in crude oil prices helped shares of industrial conglomerates such as diversified manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape and Post-It notes, whose stock gained 1.4 percent, or $1.11, to $81.40 on the NYSE. 3M was the Dow\\'s second-biggest advancer, behind Altria. U.S. crude oil futures ended lower but managed to pare losses to end near $56 a barrel after falling to a 17-month low in overnight electronic trading. NYMEX crude for December delivery CLZ6, which expired at the close, settled at $55.81 a barrel, down 45 cents. During earlier electronic trading, the NYMEX December crude contract dropped as low as $54.86, the lowest since June 14, 2005. TOUGH TIMES FOR HOME BUILDERS Shares of home builders such as Beazer Homes USA Inc. ( BZH.N ) fell after the housing data. Beazer\\'s shares dropped 1.8 percent, or 82 cents, to $44.07, while shares of Lennar Corp. ( LEN.N ), another U.S. home builder, slipped 0.12 percent, or 6 cents, to $49.34. Both trade on the NYSE. Fears that computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) could struggle to keep posting strong profits also kept investors on edge, limiting gains among technology shares. Hewlett-Packard\\'s stock fell 1 percent, or 39 cents, to $39.77 and was among the biggest drags on both the Dow and the S&P 500. The company also disclosed that securities regulators had elevated an investigation into the company\\'s probe of boardroom leaks.   The biggest drag on the Nasdaq was Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ), the world\\'s largest coffee shop chain. Starbucks shares fell 5.1 percent, or $2.01, to $37.42, a day after it posted a drop in quarterly profit and revenue missed estimates. Volume was active on the NYSE, where about 1.70 billion shares changed hands, above last year\\'s daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.79 billion shares were traded, slightly below last year\\'s daily average of 1.80 billion. Decliners narrowly outnumbered advancers on the NYSE, where 1,735 stocks fell and 1,566 shares rose. On the Nasdaq, the negative breadth was more pronounced, with 1,741 stocks falling and 1,275 shares rising.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - As a buying frenzy surrounding the U.S. launch on Friday of Sony\\'s PlayStation 3 video game console moved out of mobbed stores and onto the Web, gamers\\' attention turned to Sunday\\'s launch of Nintendo\\'s Wii. \\n\\n Hundreds were making big profits reselling newly bought PS3s on Internet auction site eBay Inc.. Nearly 800 units, which retail for $500 and $600, had sold online on Friday for an average price of $2,717, bringing the total sold to just over 3,600, according to eBay Marketplace Research. Outlying bids reached $30,000. Thousands had camped outside stores to be among the first U.S. gamers to buy the PS3 on Friday. One man was shot in a robbery attempt while waiting with 15 to 20 people outside a Connecticut Wal-Mart at about 3:15 a.m. EST. He was shot after refusing to hand over money to two armed men. He was in serious condition at a Massachusetts hospital, police said. Unruly crowds prompted the closure of two Wal-Mart stores in Palmdale, California, earlier in the week and skirmishes broke out in front of other U.S. stores as nerves wore thin for shoppers, some of whom had camped out for several days. With hundreds waiting outside stores in some places, the wait turned into a social event. Finger food was showered upon those outside Sony\\'s midtown Manhattan store, as thumping music blared. Some used discarded bags of shredded paper as billowy chairs, while a lamp shade sheltered one man from the rain. Even former Senator John Edwards became entangled in the PS3 scramble. Wal-Mart said a staffer had asked to get a machine for Edwards, who has criticized the retailer\\'s treatment of workers. Edwards said the staffer acted without permission and denied he wanted a PS3 from Wal-Mart. Investors are closely watching sales of the PS3 as a key test of Sony\\'s grip on the $30 billion gaming industry, particularly as it faces rising competition from Microsoft Corp. and Nintendo Co. Ltd.. About 400,000 units were expected to be available in the United States on Friday alone, one week after the initial launch in Japan. Sony aims to make 1 million PS3s available in the United States by the end of the year. The retail frenzy of this new game console cycle will be capped this weekend with the debut of Nintendo\\'s much-anticipated Wii. Some industry watchers predict lines outside stores will be bigger than for the PS3 because the Wii is less expensive and there are more ready for launch. PS3 KEY TO TURNAROUND The PS3 buzz is a welcome break after a tough year for Sony, following a recall of nearly 10 million of its computer batteries, PS3 delays and a flat-screen TV price war. Sony shares closed 1.3 percent higher at 4,770 yen in Tokyo on Friday. Sony is expected to lose money at first on each PS3 sale. The unit can also be used to surf the Internet, download video and music and play movies with a Blu-ray high-definition disc drive. But high production costs have dragged Sony\\'s game unit into a deep loss for the year through March. Experts say the PS3 could last a decade and go a long way toward helping Sony stay atop the gaming market, while aiding efforts to make Blu-ray the next-generation DVD standard. \"The PS3 does so much that it can become the centerpiece of a home entertainment system,\" Kaz Hirai, chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment America, said in an interview. Some analysts say the PS3\\'s high price could deter non-gaming consumers and open Sony up to stronger competition from the $400 high-end Xbox 360 and the $250 Wii. \"They will sell out of the 400,000 (units), with the hard-core gamers,\" said IDC analyst Danielle Levitas of the PS3. \"But with Blu-ray, they are betting their strongest business unit on a technology that it\\'s not clear most consumers want.\" Only about 500 PS3s were available for sale at the midnight Friday launch in New York, officials said, leaving hundreds out in the rain holding on to promises that more boxes would be made available when the store reopened at dawn. In Boston, police were called in to turn away hundreds of gamers waiting at a Best Buy after it turned out the store did not have a permit to open at midnight. Of the Connecticut shooting, Sony said in a statement it was \"not reflective of what the thousands of U.S. consumers experienced.\" Angel Paredes, who waited four days through rain storms in New York, was the first to buy a PS3 in the United States, and vowed he would not put it up for sale. Kamau Romero, a 24-year-old educator, who was third in line, was not so sure. \"It would take a lot to get it out of my hands, but it is possible. You never know,\" Romero said.

       "  ' BERKELEY, California  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) needs a dramatic organizational shake-up and cuts in its work force of up to 20 percent, according to an internal memo written last month by Senior Vice President Brad Garlinghouse. \\n\\n Garlinghouse, a second-tier Yahoo executive who has taken increasing powerful roles in the company since joining 3 1/2 years ago, argues that Yahoo suffers from a lack of consistent leadership, business focus and a \"single cohesive strategy.\" \"We lack a focused, cohesive vision for our company,\" Garlinghouse writes. \"We want to do everything and be everything -- to everyone.\" The document was published in the Saturday edition of the Wall Street Journal. A Yahoo spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the memo, but declined to comment directly on details contained in the memo or in the newspaper story. The Journal story also describes rumors that Chief Operating Officer Dan Rosensweig and Chief Financial Officer Sue Decker could be elevated to become co-presidents, in preparation for the retirement of Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Semel, age 64, who joined Yahoo five years ago. The call for restructuring follows a series of embarrassments that have caused Yahoo shares to lose 31.5 percent of their value so far this year. It is struggling with a slowdown in parts of its advertising business while racing to keep pace with far-faster growing rival Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ). The memo -- known as \"The Peanut Butter Manifesto\" because it argues that Yahoo\\'s investment strategy is like spreading peanut butter too thinly on bread -- argues for a \"radical reorganization\" of the 12-year-old Internet media giant. JOB CUTS URGED \"I hate peanut butter,\" Garlinghouse writes. The Yahoo executive said the company should cut its work force by 15 percent to 20 percent as part of a plan to reshape the current business unit structure and eliminate the bureaucratic duplication of functions that exist across Yahoo. The Sunnyvale, California-based company has nearly 10,000 employees worldwide. \"There are so many people in charge (or believe that they are in charge) that it\\'s not clear if anyone is in charge.\" \"I believe we must embrace our problems and challenges and that we must take decisive action,\" the memo states bluntly. Garlinghouse names a variety of duplicative groups that pit established business units against new initiatives, including music, photos, search, applications, social networks, global strategy and even who controls the Yahoo home page. In a statement, Yahoo\\'s leadership has defined three areas of focus for its business. During its quarterly financial conference call last month, Semel described efforts to close the gap with rival Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) in how much revenue it generates from its search business, increase its lead in brand advertising and get a jump on emerging markets like video, mobile and social networks. \"The memo itself highlights that we have an open, collaborative culture and a senior management team that is intensely committed to helping Yahoo! fulfill its potential as an Internet leader,\" the Yahoo statement said. The Journal said the memo has received support from Yahoo senior management and that Garlinghouse had been asked to head an internal committee to investigate the issues he raises. \"All is not well,\" Garlinghouse writes. The memo itself was written in response to an October 11 New York Times article that he describes as \"a painful public flogging.\" \"While it lacked accurate details, its conclusions rang true, and thus was a much needed wake up call,\" the Yahoo executive writes. \"It\\'s time for us to get back up.\"',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Trading will slow to a crawl on Wall Street this week, with the market closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday, but investors\\' attention will quickly turn to retail sales the next day. \\n\\n Among the scant data set for release this week is the final November reading of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, due on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the sentiment reading for November to come in at 93.1, close to the month\\'s preliminary index at 93.6. The real test of the U.S. shopper\\'s staying power will come on \"Black Friday,\" the unofficial kickoff of the Christmas shopping season. If the throngs of shoppers lined up for Friday\\'s launch of Sony\\'s PlayStation 3 video game console and Sunday\\'s release of Nintendo\\'s Wii are any indication, this year\\'s Christmas sales might prompt some dancing on the Street. This week\\'s earnings releases will amount to just a trickle, with only six Standard & Poor\\'s 500 components set to report results. The most closely watched will include upscale department store chain Nordstrom Inc. ( JWN.N ), which releases its quarterly scorecard on Monday. Luxury retailers have been optimistic about the outlook for holiday shopping. Nordstrom was among the few retailers to post better-than-expected same-store sales in October. No. 2 home improvement chain Lowe\\'s Companies Inc. ( LOW.N ) is another key company also expected to report results on Monday. Shares of home builders and related companies were battered last week after Lowe\\'s rival Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) and housewares retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc.( WSM.N ) both cut their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, blaming a slowdown in the U.S. housing market. LISTEN TO THE BOND MARKET Adding to housing-sector woes was a report on Friday showing October had the sharpest decline in housing starts since 2000. But its impact may not weigh heavily on the market since some investors consider it positive for stocks if the housing slowdown pushes the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy and reduce interest rates. \"The Street has a very short memory, and there\\'s a tremendous bullish bias, but bonds have been telling the opposite story,\" said Gary Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling & Co., an investment research firm in Springfield, New Jersey. \"Bonds are telling you: \\'Not only is the Fed through with raising rates, but we\\'ve probably got economic weakness.\\' My suspicion is that bonds have it right,\" Shilling added. \"Yes, interest rates are going down, but the damage to profits more than offsets that.\" The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note\\'s US10YT=RR yield fell to 4.61 percent on Friday from 4.67 percent late on Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped more than half a point -- rising 17/32 to 100-5/32 as the surprisingly weak housing data bolstered the view that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in 2007. Normal trading hours are in effect this week from Monday through Wednesday, with the stock market closed on Thursday and shutting early on Friday. The bond market\\'s early closing on Wednesday may mean many stock players also will leave early for the long holiday weekend. The week ahead \"is going to be a slow week unless there\\'s some sort of geopolitical action, which could maybe move the market,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. \"In a slow week, if there\\'s some sort of big news, the move could be much more volatile than usual because volume will be light.\" Other economic releases include the index of leading U.S. economic indicators for October on Monday and the weekly mortgage market index on Wednesday. The Reuters poll calls for a 0.2 percent gain in the October leading indicators index, compared with September\\'s 0.1 percent rise. DOW UP 15 PERCENT THIS YEAR \"The bulls are getting tired,\" said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. \"They\\'ve done their work and you\\'ve had this crazy stampede into the marketplace. I think there\\'s time for a rest, at least.\" Until they hear from retailers about Black Friday\\'s sales, bulls and bears may just have to take a break and enjoy some turkey. While they\\'re kicking back, though, investors have some nice numbers to ponder about the Dow hitting record after record for the past several weeks, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also run to highs not seen for the past 5 1/2 to six years. For the year, the Dow is up 1,625.06 points -- a gain of 15.2 percent. The S&P 500 is up 152.91 points for the year -- an increase of 12.3 percent. The Nasdaq is up 240.54 points so far this year -- a gain of 10.9 percent. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 36.74 points, or 0.30 percent, to finish at a record 12,342.56 -- also its session high and a lifetime high so far. Since October began, the Dow has closed at a record 18 times. With Friday\\'s closing bell, the Dow had booked a sixth straight session of gains -- its longest winning streak in a year. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  gained 1.44 points, or 0.10 percent, to end on Friday at 1,401.20. But the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 3.20 points, or 0.13 percent, to close on Friday at 2,445.86. For the past week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent, the Nasdaq jumped 2.4 percent and the S&P 500 gained 1.5 percent. The stock market\\'s rally this fall has been fueled in part by sliding oil prices, which result in lower energy costs for corporations and consumers. On Friday, U.S. oil futures hit a 17-month low amid rising U.S. crude oil inventories in the past week and concerns about an economic slowdown. The expiring December crude oil contract CLZ6 declined 45 cents to settle at $55.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That\\'s a drop of almost 29 percent from the NYMEX record of $78.40 a barrel set in mid-July. Just before the November 7 midterm elections, the U.S. average cost of a gallon of gasoline fell to $2.1820, according to the nationwide Lundberg survey. That is the lowest average retail gasoline price seen in 2006. If that trend holds, that could prompt consumers to spend more on Christmas and give retailers the sound they love most at this time of year: Ka-ching!

       "  ' ALGIERS  (Reuters) - OPEC may decide on a second output reduction at its December meeting to strengthen the stability of oil prices, Algeria\\'s Energy and Mines Minister Chakib Khelil said on Sunday. \\n\\n OPEC, which pumps about a third of the world\\'s crude, agreed last month to its first formal output curbs in over two years, in order to shore up sagging prices. But in the last week prices resumed falling amid still high U.S. inventories and a broad commodities sell-off by investors, taking crude oil prices to their lowest level in 17 months. Khelil told state radio: \"We may decide a second reduction in crude oil production to strengthen the stabilization of the price of oil.\" He said the market had started to stabilize with the approach of the northern hemisphere winter, a period when demand usually increases. He added: \"But it\\'s also very possible that we\\'re going to see a weakening of prices in the second quarter of 2007 because normally in the second quarter there\\'ll be a fall in demand of 2 million barrels per day.\" OPEC President Edmund Daukoru, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf OPEC members have all said they see scope for deepening a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels a day when OPEC next meets on December 14, pointing to high fuel stocks in top consumer the United States as evidence that the market remains oversupplied. Some traders, as well as the U.S. government, have said they doubted the resolve of the OPEC countries to comply strictly with the agreement. But in Tehran, Iran\\'s OPEC governor said there were signs that OPEC members were complying. \"There are various indications that OPEC members have been committed to their promise to cut 1.2 million barrels per day,\" Hossein Kazempour Ardebili was quoted as saying on the Oil Ministry\\'s Web site SHANA. He cited falling shipping rates, indications that stocks were shrinking in some consuming countries and a halt to the slide in world oil prices. However, Hojjatollah Ghanimifard of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) was also quoted as calling for coordination between OPEC and Non-Opec countries to stabilize oil markets. \"OPEC members ... and non-OPEC oil producer countries should actively take part to manage (oil) supply in international markets,\" Ghanimifard, NIOC\\'s executive director of international affairs, was quoted as saying by SHANA. He said that the oil market still faced fluctuations, adding that it was unlikely to see stable oil prices in the near future. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said this month that it expected OPEC to reduce output by just 745,000 bpd.',\n",
       "  ' DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia  (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco expects to sign an agreement with U.S. company Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ) for a $15 billion petrochemical plant at Ras Tanura in early 2007, an Aramco official said on Sunday. \\n\\n Aramco also expects to raise debt of upwards of $10 billion for the project, in which it plans to float 30 percent to the public, said project official Fayez al-Sharef. In July the state oil firm chose Dow Chemical to discuss a partnership to set up, own and operate a plant for chemicals and plastics near the 550,000-barrels per day Ras Tanura oil refinery. \"We are in the middle of negotiations for the memorandum of understanding with Dow Chemical,\" Sharef told an energy forum in the eastern city of Dammam. \"Early next year we will finalize that and then the joint venture agreement will follow.\" He later told reporters the initial public offering for 30 percent of the project would only take place after the completion of front end engineering design (FEED) for the project as well as the financing. He said the FEED contract would be awarded early next year and that construction would not start before 2009. Sharef said the project, slated for startup in the second quarter of 2012, was expected to cost in excess of $15 billion. \"A substantial project financing effort will be required to support the large investment requirement. The expectation is we will raise debt upwards of $10 billion,\" he said. The core units of the project are an ethane/naphtha-based cracker, a high olefin fluid catalytic cracking complex, an aromatics complex and a chlor-alkali complex. It involves around 30 downstream process units producing more than 300 different products, he said. Saudi Arabia, the world\\'s top oil exporter, is expanding its industrial sector in a bid to diversify its oil-based economy. Aramco is also engaged in a $10-billion refining and petrochemicals joint venture project with Japan\\'s Sumitomo Chemical ( 4005.T ). Saad al-Dosari, CEO of the PetroRabigh project, told the forum that the first phase of the complex was scheduled to start up in the third quarter of 2008. He said an IPO for the project would take place \"hopefully soon\". Saudi Arabia\\'s oil minister had said in March an IPO for at least 25 percent of the project would take place before the end of 2006. PetroRabigh will increase gasoline production capacity at the 400,000 bpd Rabigh refinery by 60,000 bpd alongside an ethane-fed petrochemical cracker with 1.3 million tonnes a year of ethylene capacity.',\n",
       "  ' SYDNEY  (Reuters) - The Group of 20 economic powers will call for \"adequate\" foreign exchange flexibility in a communique on Sunday after a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers, a source told Reuters. \\n\\n The source said the communique would also call for an \"early\" resumption of stalled world trade talks and urge more transparency in energy markets. Financial leaders from developed and emerging economies on Saturday expressed confidence in global growth prospects, but tensions emerged over foreign exchange rates and nagging trade imbalances. The two-day meeting, which brings together countries representing 85 percent of the world economy, will wrap up with broad agreement that the outlook for global growth is strong. Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, whose country is hosting the event, said on Saturday ministers were optimistic as the United States, Europe and Japan were all expanding. However, Costello said no country had said it believed its currency was undervalued, a tacit sign that China had not accepted complaints that the yuan was too weak. Critics of China, particularly from the United States, have charged that Beijing keeps the currency unfairly cheap to boost exports and this increases trade imbalances. China revalued the yuan by 2.1 percent in July 2005 and cut it from a decade-old dollar peg. It has since risen nearly another 3 percent. Participants at the meeting in Australia\\'s second-biggest city have also raised concerns about the risks to inflation posed by high oil prices, despite a retreat to below $60 a barrel from a record high near $80 a few months ago. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said on Saturday he saw no sign oil prices would fall any time soon, a warning underscored by a report from U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers that saw crude prices averaging about $72 a barrel next year. Rato said the longer oil prices stay high the greater the inflationary risks and the more it will sap domestic spending power. The streets around the city centre hotel hosting the meeting were quiet on Sunday, following clashes on Saturday between police and a small group of protesters who overturned barricades and stormed a police riot truck.',\n",
       "  ' MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Following is a communique issued from a November 18-19 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 (G20) economic powers. \\n\\n Communique We, the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the G-20, held our eighth meeting in Melbourne, Australia, under the theme of Building and Sustaining Prosperity. Sustained economic growth is delivering rising living standards and permanent reductions in poverty. Deeper linkages are being forged between nations through trade, investment and the movement of people and capital. These developments provide unprecedented opportunities to spread the benefits of growth widely. Yet we also face shared challenges, including those arising from ageing populations in many countries and rapid population growth in much of the developing world. Meeting these challenges requires effective domestic policy responses supported by effective international policy cooperation and strong and inclusive international institutions. Global outlook G-20 members noted that the world economy continues to expand at a solid pace, with growth above its long-term average for the fourth consecutive year. The outlook remains positive. Global economic growth is expected to slow slightly from the rapid pace of the past few years. Growth in industrialized countries is expected to moderate slightly from its recent strong pace. Among emerging market countries, output growth is expected to remain strong, with key economies like China and India continuing their rapid expansion. Above average growth in the global economy has seen spare capacity decline which, combined with buoyant energy and mineral prices, has increased the risks to inflation. Maintaining strong world growth and containing inflation will require ongoing adjustments to monetary and fiscal policies while ensuring appropriate exchange rate flexibility and structural reform. We need to take advantage of the present strength in the global economy to get policy settings right. Faced with potential inflationary pressures, the normalization of monetary policy underway in many G-20 countries will need to continue. Fiscal policy needs to ensure that public-sector balance sheets are not vulnerable to slower revenue growth and higher expenditure when growth rates resume more normal trajectories, and that there is sufficient room for policy to respond if growth slows more sharply than currently anticipated. We are determined to implement these policies, which are also required to enable global imbalances between countries to unwind in an orderly manner. Stable global economic growth depends on open trade. G-20 members warned of the threat to global prosperity from rising protectionism in trade and investment. The success of the Doha Development Round is essential to securing freer, more open trade, reducing the risk of economic and financial instability, and achieving faster economic growth, development and sustained reductions in poverty. G-20 members call for an early resumption of WTO negotiations and the achievement of an ambitious outcome for the benefit of all. Global energy and minerals markets G-20 consideration of global energy and minerals markets reflects the importance of resource consumption, production, investment and trade to the world economy. Global demand for energy and minerals commodities is set to increase significantly over coming decades driven by a strong world economy, rising incomes, and ongoing industrialization and urbanization in many economies. While physical stocks exist to meet demand and investment is increasing, the expansion of supply to date has struggled to keep pace with demand growth, resulting in significant increases in prices. We agreed that enhancing global trade by strengthening markets, and ensuring sustainability by promoting investment and encouraging efficiency, are the best ways to deliver lasting resource security. We discussed the challenges to macroeconomic policy presented by energy and minerals price cycles. Monetary authorities remain vigilant in keeping inflation low and stable and stand ready to contain second-round price effects. Flexible domestic economies and exchange rates help facilitate adjustment to large movements in traded goods prices. Finance ministers are also focused on key fiscal challenges such as managing revenue surges and the appropriate level of energy subsidies. We agreed that further reform of energy subsidies is a priority in order to improve fiscal sustainability, better target poverty, and ensure that price signals work to expand supply and induce efficiency. We reaffirmed the commitment we made in the G-20 Accord for Sustained Growth in 2004 to direct domestic policies toward creating a favorable overall investment climate and enhancing domestic and international competition. We discussed how the current resources boom can be harnessed for growth and development, highlighting the importance of sound domestic policy and effective governance for boosting investment. We welcomed further work on principles for the efficient and effective governance of extractive firms, both private and state-owned. We noted the benefits of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a voluntary initiative to strengthen transparency, governance and investment-led development in resource-rich countries, and encourage governments and firms to support the initiative. We support continued progress on the World Bank-led Clean Energy Investment framework.',\n",
       "  ' MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - The world\\'s main economies face growing inflation risks but prospects for growth are strong, financial leaders said on Sunday after a meeting that also featured fresh calls for more foreign exchange flexibility. \\n\\n The Group of 20 (G20) countries addressed a raft of financial sore spots ranging from stalled trade talks to currency values, wrapping up a two-day meeting with an upbeat but sober statement. The group did not mention China by name when referring to currency policy, but officials signaled the G20 clearly had the new economic superpower in mind. \"Around a table like that it is well known who has a flexible exchange rate and who doesn\\'t. So without getting too personal when you talk about flexibility for exchange rates, it is well known what\\'s meant,\" Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said. \"As I see it, there was encouragement towards more flexibility, and I think all of the countries agree with that. It is just a question of timing,\" said Costello, whose country was host to the meeting. In a communique, the G20 spoke of strong growth and highlighted the danger of inflation. \"We need to take advantage of the present strength in the global economy to get policy settings right,\" it said. Interest rates throughout the industrialized and developing world have been rising this year and last, but they have been coming off of historically low levels. What is more, following wild gyrations in the prices of oil and commodities, ministers voiced concern about inflation rearing its head. \"Faced with potential inflationary pressures, the normalization of monetary policy underway in many G20 countries will need to continue,\" the group said. A Brazilian official, however, later told reporters that both Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank (ECB) President Jean-Claude Trichet were positive on inflation. \"Mr. Bernanke was optimistic about inflation in America,\" Brazil\\'s Secretary for International Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Luiz Melin said after the meeting. \"Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet also mentioned that as far as the ECB was concerned, while they cannot afford to be complacent, they were also very happy about that (inflation).\" The G20 includes major economies such as the United States and Japan, as well as big emerging powers such as China and India. Together, its members represent 85 percent of global economic output. CLASHES OUTSIDE, CIVILITY INSIDE About 5,000 people had marched through Australia\\'s second city on the first day of the meeting, chanting anti-G20 slogans, while a small group of protesters clashed with police and smashed up a police riot truck. There was no sign of violence on Sunday as the meeting drew to a close. In contrast to the conflict outside of the hotel where the meeting was staged, ministers inside spoke of polite cooperation. South Africa Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said member countries are realistic about the obstacles against more free-floating currencies. \"What doesn\\'t happen at G20 is a Monty Python-esque beating up of countries. I think that we allow ourselves to see there are difficulties in a number of countries. Whether you are talking energy or exchange rates, there is nothing to suggest that we convened in order to beat up on China.\" The United States had vowed to discuss currency flexibility with China, which critics have complained keeps its yuan too low to boost its exports. But U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt, in a statement after the meeting, did not mention China, instead only saying G20 members were pleased to hear from the United States about its strong and healthy growth. The communique called for \"appropriate\" exchange rate flexibility. \"Maintaining strong world growth and containing inflation will require ongoing adjustments to monetary and fiscal policies while ensuring appropriate exchange rate flexibility and structural reform,\" it said. Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui said it had not been written with any specific country\\'s policy in mind. While China\\'s currency regime is arguably the most prominent source of economic debate, policy makers have also been increasingly focused on Japan\\'s weak yen, which has raised the ire of European authorities because of its effect on trade. One reason for the yen\\'s fragility has been Japan\\'s ultra-low interest rates. The BOJ only recently increased rates to 0.25 percent from virtually zero after seven years of deflation. Fukui said he had told G20 members Japan will continue to adjust monetary policy gradually to keep its economy recovering. REVIVING TRADE TALKS Sensing a window of opportunity may be closing soon, the G20 called for an early resumption of talks to revive the Doha round of trade negotiations. The talks are aimed at a package that could help lift millions out of poverty, but they have stalled as major trading powers have refused to make big concessions. \"It is urgent that we get the Doha round restarted,\" Costello said. \"To break the impasse on agriculture will require new concessions in Europe, counterbalancing concessions in America.\" Ministers have warned that a failure to get Doha going could seriously dent the world economy\\'s long-term prospects. For now, though, the overall view among member countries was of optimism over growth prospects. \"G20 members noted that the world economy continues to expand at a solid pace, with growth above its long-term average for the fourth consecutive year,\" the group said.',\n",
       "  ' LOD, Israel  (Reuters) - Computer and software giant Hewlett Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) said on Sunday its largest research and development center will be located in Israel in the wake of its acquisition of Mercury Interactive MERQ.PK. \\n\\n HP bought Mercury for about $4.5 billion in stock in a deal that was completed earlier in November. Thomas Hogan, senior vice president of HP Software\\'s technology solutions group, said HP has opted to keep Mercury\\'s 700 employees that had worked in its offices in Yehud, a town near Tel Aviv, which will bring HP\\'s workforce in Israel to more than 3,000 -- the second largest tech firm after Intel ( INTC.O ). \"HP is committed to Israel,\" Hogan told a news conference a few miles from Tel Aviv. \"We have made a decision to continue and maintain operations in Yehud ... The people based in Israel will be responsible for HP\\'s technology moving forward. \"The R&D center in Yehud will be our largest in the world,\" he said. \"This operation is the best of the best.\" Boaz Chalamish, the global head of R&D for HP Software, said the Yehud center will now have a much broader portfolio of products to produce. \"It will do everything it did but with much faster execution,\" he said. The deal to buy Mercury was HP\\'s largest since a $19 billion buyout of Compaq in 2002. It also matched the largest foreign purchase involving an Israeli company. The merger moved HP to the sixth largest software company in the world in terms of revenues. Hogan said that Mercury will be integrated into HP\\'s financial results beginning in the first quarter -- HP\\'s current quarter -- ending January 31. In 2007, Mercury will be dilutive by 4 cents a share on a proforma basis but is expected to be accretive by 2 cents a share in 2008. HP, which last week reported a jump fourth-quarter net profit that beat estimates, expects the addition of Mercury will result in annual revenue growth of 10 to 15 percent -- half of that amount coming from Mercury and above the sector\\'s growth of 8 to 9 percent. \"We expect to take more market share,\" Hogan said. But he noted that HP remained largely focused on enterprise management software and that HP was not seeking to compete with the likes of Oracle ORCL.O and SAP ( SAPG.DE ). \"We will look to fill in the gaps to make sure we are the leader in enterprise management,\" Hogan said, adding HP was looking for acquisitions.',\n",

       "  ' HANOI  (Reuters) - Russia and the United States signed a bilateral deal on Sunday for Moscow\\'s entry in the World Trade Organization, removing the last major obstacle in Russia\\'s 13-year-old bid to join the global trade body. \\n\\n The agreement was signed by Russia\\'s Economy Minister German Gref and U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Hanoi. The signing was timed to take place before a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President George W. Bush, who both took part in the APEC summit, on Sunday. \"Undoubtedly, this agreement is a very substantial milestone in the full integration of Russia into the global economy,\" Gref told reporters after the signing ceremony. Russia, the last major economy outside the 149-member trade body, would benefit from a \"significant increase\" in global trade after joining the world trade body, Schwab said. U.S. business groups have welcomed the pact, which officials said removes long-standing Russian obstacles to U.S. beef, pork and poultry exports and required Moscow to cut tariffs on a long list of agricultural and manufactured goods. Russia has also agreed to open up its services sector and to combat piracy and counterfeiting of foreign goods. Gref told reporters on Saturday personal contacts between Putin and Bush played a key role in speeding up the deal, the last and most difficult in a string of 56 similar agreements signed by Russia in the past six years. \"The next stage, multilateral talks, normally takes 6-8 months,\" Gref said. \"We would want to finalize the whole process by mid-2007,\" he said. Bush said after his summit with Putin that the agreement \"will be good for the United States and good for Russia.\" The U.S.-Russia deal could yet face a rough ride from the Democrat-led U.S. Congress, although lawmakers do not have the power to block Russia\\'s accession to the WTO. Schwab said granting permanent normal trade relations to Russia would be key for U.S. businesses eyeing the country. \"The full integration of Russia into the global economy is in the interests of Russia. It is also in the interests of the United States,\" she told reporters. Gref said on Saturday delays in U.S. ratification of Russia\\'s WTO entry could upset bilateral ties but would not slow Russian accession. Some Russian analysts have speculated that Bush, who needs a strong political boost after the Republican defeat in the mid-term polls, pushed for a WTO deal with Russia in the hope of getting Putin\\'s support on issues like Iran or Iraq. Gref denied any link. \"The basic issues were agreed before the U.S. elections,\" he said. \"I cannot recall any specific event that has made our WTO talks easier.\" (Additional reporting by Darren Schuettler)',\n",

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The long-rumored arrival of a \\nhybrid mobile phone and iPod music player from Apple Computer \\nInc. ( AAPL.O ) has morphed from a question of \"If\" to \"When\" \\namong fans and analysts. \\n\\n  Since Apple\\'s introduction of the iPod five years ago, the \\ncompany has sold more than 67 million of the devices and more \\nthan 1.5 billion songs from its iTunes online music store.  Now, Chief Executive Steve Jobs and Apple are poised to \\nroll out what has been dubbed the \"iPhone,\" perhaps as soon as \\nJanuary next year at the Macworld conference that kicks off \\nevery new year, analysts say.  \"From a technical standpoint, the phone is pretty much \\ndone,\" said American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu. \"It\\'s \\na big endeavor and we believe it\\'s beyond speculation.\"  Speculation has simmered since even before the introduction \\nof the ROKR phone from Motorola Inc. MOT.N that uses a \\nslimmed-down version of the iTunes digital music jukebox to \\nplay 100 songs. But sales were lackluster as users complained \\nthe phone did not hold more songs.  In recent weeks, blogs that cater to Apple fans have been \\nbuzzing insistently that the iPhone is coming. Just this week, \\nthe Taiwanese financial daily, Commercial Times, reported that \\nTaiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd. ( 2317.TW ) is \\nbuilding the iPhone.  \"There is a lot of buzz,\" said Gartner analyst Mike \\nMcGuire. \"But there are also a lot of things in the way that \\nmake it difficult. Which carrier and the like they use are not \\ntrivial challenges.\"  An Apple spokesman said the company does not comment on \\nrumors or speculation.  Jobs and Apple are famously tight-lipped about unannounced \\nproducts. But company Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer \\ndid hint about a possible mobile phone with iPod-like functions \\nduring a conference call with analysts in July to discuss \\nthird-quarter financial results.\\n  \\'NOT SITTING AROUND DOING NOTHING\\'  Asked to comment on how Apple would compete with offerings \\nsuch as Sony Corp.\\'s ( 6758.T )( SNE.N ) popular Walkman phone, \\nOppenheimer said he believed Apple would do just fine.  \"We don\\'t think that the phones that are available today \\nmake the best music players,\" he said. \"We think the iPod is. \\nBut over time, that is likely to change. And we\\'re not sitting \\naround doing nothing.\"  Analyst Wu believes the iPhone would be a candy-bar-shaped \\nphone, rather than a flip phone like Motorola\\'s huge hit, the \\nRAZR mobile phone.  And he believes the iPhone would not be too bogged down \\nwith all the bells and whistles often crammed into today\\'s \\nsmart phones.  \"I think it\\'ll be pretty simple with functionality probably \\nsimilar to an iPod Nano,\" Wu said. \"It\\'s going to be very \\nsimilar to the Sony Walkman phone, which is very media-centric \\nand that\\'s Apple\\'s strength.\"  The now-widely-expected iPhone is also a way for Apple to \\nadd yet another line of revenue to its business. Sales of the \\niPod, still far and away the No. 1 digital music player, have \\nmoderated somewhat recently and sales of Mac computers, now \\npowered by Intel Corp. chips, have set records.  But with about a billion cell phones expected to be sold \\nnext year, if Apple can break into that market and be half as \\nwell received as its iPod was, it adds up to serious dollars.  Wu estimates that a 1 percent share of a billion unit \\nmarket, with the iPhone carrying an average price tag of $200, \\ncould mean about $2 billion a year more for the Cupertino, \\nCalifornia-based company.  But Apple needs to learn from the ROKR and introduce a real \\nphone, not just a music player with a phone jammed in almost as \\nan afterthought, analysts said.  \"The key challenge here is if they were doing it, it has to \\nbe a very good phone and a good extension or subset of the iPod \\nand iTunes software,\" McGuire said. \"It\\'s not just music. It \\nwould have to be a good media device.\"  One other not inconsiderable decision is what cell phone \\nstandard -- CDMA or GSM, for example -- the phone would use and \\nwhether Apple would link up with one mobile phone company to \\nprovide the service.  Some Mac watchers, such as site ThinkSecret, have mentioned \\nCingular as an early, exclusive winner. Still others say the \\nphone will be sold with an Apple-branded MVNO, or mobile \\nvirtual network operator, in which Apple effectively leases \\nexcess capacity from other mobile service providers and resells \\nit to customers.  \"The other thing is finding a set of carriers or an \\necosystem where they wouldn\\'t need to be dependent on the \\ncarriers,\" McGuire said. \"But they\\'ve won over tough audiences \\nbefore, like the music labels.\"',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said \\non Monday that rules to head off corporate scandals like those \\nin the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law must be applied with care to \\navoid damaging U.S. competitive ability. \\n\\n  \"Excessive regulation slows innovation, imposes needless \\ncosts on investors, and stifles competition and job creation,\" \\nPaulson told the Economic Club of New York, noting that \\ncompanies seem less eager to go public in the United States.  Paulson, speaking for the first time since Democrats \\ncaptured majorities in both houses of Congress in November 7 \\nelections, said the Treasury plans to sponsor a conference \\nearly next year to weigh how to protect U.S. competitiveness.  While the Bush administration has signaled it wants a light \\nhand on regulation, Democrats have indicated they feel \\ncorporate scandals like the Enron Corp. collapse and huge \\nexecutive compensation needs careful scrutiny.  Paulson singled out the Sarbanes-Oxley rules, designed in \\nthe wake of Enron to give investors more information, for \\nspecial comment. He said new laws to amend Sarbanes-Oxley were \\nnot needed but its provisions should be applied flexibly to \\nreduce compliance costs, especially for small businesses.\\n  MARKETS THE \"LIFEBLOOD\"  Paulson, a former chairman of Wall Street giant Goldman \\nSachs, called capital markets \"the lifeblood of our economy\" \\nand said they remained \"the deepest, most efficient and most \\ntransparent in the world\" but cited reasons for concern.  \"Recently, in the wake of new, heightened regulatory and \\nlisting requirements for all public companies in the U.S., we \\nhave witnessed changes in IPO (initial public offering) \\nactivity,\" Paulson said.  He said IPO dollar volume \"is well below the historical \\ntrend\" and more public companies are going private instead of \\nremaining as publicly listed, shareholder companies.  \"This is occurring in record numbers, at record volumes \\nand, as a percentage of overall public company M&A (mergers and \\nacquisition) activity, is approaching levels we have not seen \\nin almost 20 years,\" Paulson said.  He said layers of regulation create a situation that not \\nonly makes enforcement inefficient but also \"can appear \\nconfusing and threatening\" to companies.\\n  WASTED EFFORT  Paulson expressed special concern about section 404 \\nprovisions of Sarbanes-Oxley that require managers to assess \\nthe effectiveness of a company\\'s internal controls and have an \\nauditor attest that they are sufficient.  \"It seems clear that a significant portion of the time, \\nenergy and expense associated with implementing section 404 \\nmight have been better focused on direct business matters that \\ncreate jobs and reward shareholders,\" Paulson said.  The Treasury chief said \"we cannot legislate or rule-make \\nour way to ethical behavior,\" but instead must count on \\ncorporate behavior being based upon strong principles.  After his address, questioners asked Paulson what he \\nintends to focus on in the remaining two years of the Bush \\nadministration and whether he still thought an overhaul of the \\nSocial Security retirement system was possible.  \"It\\'s a good time to deal with it just because our \\neconomy\\'s so strong and economic policies are working well, and \\nwe\\'re better off dealing with this at a time of strength,\" \\nPaulson replied, adding it would be impossible to do unless \\nDemocrats joined him in a bipartisan effort.  Paulson\\'s predecessor, John Snow, tried in vain in 2005 to \\nsell a Bush administration proposal for making private accounts \\npart of Social Security.  The Social Security system is projected to face enormous \\nstrain as \"baby boomers\" retire but the Bush administration was \\ncriticized for seeking a solution in the private sector rather \\nthan through public policy.  Paulson, who took over the Treasury Department in July and \\navoided campaigning during the congressional elections, has \\nmade improving trade relations with China a priority and noted \\nhe was heading back to Beijing in about three weeks\\' time.  But he played down hopes for quick success in either \\npersuading China to revalue its yuan currency upward or to \\nboost domestic consumption as he and others agree is needed to \\nhelp reduce record U.S.-China trade deficits.  \"We are taking a long-term approach and I think we can make \\nprogress by having discussions that are more strategic and \\nlonger-term orientated, dealing with some of the real \\nfundamental issues,\" Paulson said.

( BAC.N )\\non Monday said it will buy Charles Schwab Corp.\\'s SCHW.O U.S.\\nTrust Corp. unit for $3.3 billion to expand in the lucrative\\nbusiness of managing money for the rich.  The all-cash purchase will vault Bank of America to the top\\nspot in the business known as private banking, with $261\\nbillion of assets under management. JPMorgan Chase & Co.\\n( JPM.N ) will be second with $204 billion.  Schwab, for its part, is jettisoning a unit catering to\\nmultimillionaires to focus on providing low-cost services to\\nordinary investors who like doing their own trading.  Adding the 153-year-old U.S. Trust, a venerable name known\\nfor handling money of families like the Astors, \"enhances our\\ncredibility\" in wealth management, Bank of America Chief\\nExecutive Kenneth Lewis said in a statement.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the No. 2\\nU.S. bank, is expanding through non-bank purchases in areas\\nwhere it has not traditionally been dominant, as it nears the\\nregulatory ceiling of 10 percent of all U.S. deposits.  The bank is adding 13,600 clients and $94 billion of assets\\nunder management from U.S. Trust. Its private bank already has\\n114,000 customers and $167 billion of assets.  Peter Scaturro, U.S. Trust\\'s chief executive, will oversee\\na combined private banking unit at Bank of America, reporting\\nto wealth and investment management chief Brian Moynihan.  \"The idea is to build a dominant wealth-management\\nfranchise,\" Scaturro said on a conference call. \"The U.S. is a\\nbig place with a lot of money.\"  Bank of America said the purchase will result in a $250\\nmillion charge, and may add 1 cent per share to earnings by\\n2008. It expects a closing around March 31. The bank has not\\ndecided whether to keep the U.S. Trust name.  Assets at Bank of America\\'s wealth-management arm, which\\nincludes private banking, would still trail those of Merrill\\nLynch & Co. MER.N, Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) and\\nMorgan Stanley ( MS.N ).  PRICEY?  Analysts viewed the transaction as pricey. San\\nFrancisco-based Schwab acquired U.S. Trust for $2.9 billion in\\nMay 2000, just after an equities bull market crested.  \"Schwab is getting a robust price, likely reflecting the\\npotential (for) expense and revenue synergies that never really\\nmaterialized for Schwab,\" wrote David Trone, a Fox-Pitt Kelton\\nInc. analyst.  The combined business will employ about 4,400 people.\\nMoynihan expects some cost cuts in back-office operations, and\\n\"relatively modest\" attrition among U.S. Trust customers.  Schwab will realize a $1.9 billion pre-tax gain and collect\\n$2.5 billion after taxes from the transaction. It will focus on\\nretail investors as intense competition among brokerages drives\\ncommissions lower.  Bank of America, which operates 5,722 branches, last month\\nstarted to roll out free online stock trading for customers who\\ndeposit $25,000, causing shares of discounters such as Schwab\\nto fall  Charles Schwab, who runs his namesake firm, said he plans\\nto remain a U.S. Trust client. He was not immediately available\\nfor further comment.  In afternoon trading, Schwab shares rose 35 cents to\\n$18.91, while Bank of America rose 20 cents to $55.05.  DEPOSIT CAP  U.S. Trust was founded in 1853 by industrialist Peter\\nCooper, railroad developer Erastus Corning, dry goods merchant\\nMarshall Field, and others.  Bank of America controls 9.2 percent of U.S. bank deposits\\nand cannot make a purchase that sends it above 10 percent.

( NTRS.O ) ranks third in U.S. private\\nbanking, while Citigroup ranks sixth, Bank of America said.

He\\nwill now compete directly with his former employer.

       "  '  (Adds details, comments from Evraz chairman, CFO) \\n\\n  By Robin Paxton MOSCOW  Nov 20 (Reuters) - Russian steel maker Evraz Group\\nSA HK1q.L will buy Oregon Steel Mills OS.N of the United\\nStates in a $2.3 billion deal creating the world\\'s largest rail\\nproducer and giving Evraz access to lucrative U.S. markets.  Evraz, 41 percent owned by Russia\\'s richest man, Roman\\nAbramovich, said on Monday its cash offer was 22.3 percent above\\nOregon\\'s weighted average stock price for the past three months.  \"The premium that we paid accounted for the growth in the\\nprofitability pattern of Oregon Steel,\" Evraz Chief Financial\\nOfficer Pavel Tatyanin told Reuters, saying the U.S. company had\\nposted record-high operating margins this year.  The combined company would produce 16.8 million tonnes a\\nyear of crude steel, placing it just outside the world\\'s top 10,\\nand will ship 17.4 million tonnes of steel products in 2006.  Russian steel makers including Severstal ( CHMFq.L ) ( CHMF.MM )\\nand NLMK ( NLMKq.L ), backed by some of the country\\'s richest men,\\nhave moved to acquire assets in the United States and Europe to\\nsupply high-quality steel used in cars and construction.  Evraz, Russia\\'s biggest steel maker in its home market, will\\nsupply slabs to be rolled into steel plate at Oregon\\'s mills.\\nThe U.S. firm also produces steel pipes, giving Evraz access to\\nNorth American oil and gas markets.  A source familiar with the deal said Evraz had secured\\nfinancing in the form of a bridge loan from investment banks\\nCredit Suisse and UBS, which it is likely to refinance with bank\\ndebt and bonds on the U.S. subsidiary\\'s balance sheet.  Credit Suisse advised Evraz on the deal.  \\n  EXPENSIVE  Alfa-Bank analysts said Oregon was the most expensive steel\\nmaker in the United States in terms of enterprise value to\\nearnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.  The deal would dilute Evraz\\'s value, Alfa Bank said, as the\\nRussian firm was paying 6.6 times EV/EBITDA for Oregon -- more\\nthan a 50 percent premium to its own EV/EBITDA.  \"However, in the long run we believe Evraz may generate\\nvalue from the acquisition through downstream diversification,\"\\nthe bank said.  Oregon\\'s board of directors unanimously recommended that\\nshareholders approve the offer from Evraz, which will open\\nduring the week of Nov. 27, subject to regulatory clearances.  \"The acquisition of Oregon Steel represents a solid platform\\nfor Evraz as a footprint in North America, one of the most\\nimportant markets globally,\" Evraz Chairman Alexander Frolov\\nsaid.  Moscow brokerage Aton said in a research note: \"The fact\\nthat the transaction looks a bit overvalued comes as no\\nsurprise, given the potential synergies that could be generated\\nand the generally increasing asset values.\"  Tatyanin said Oregon was preparing to start a new pipe mill\\nin the city of Portland to complement existing steel pipe\\nproduction in Canada and Colorado.  In steel plate, Evraz had boosted its share of the European\\nmarket to 10 percent with the acquisitions of Vitkovice Steel in\\nthe Czech Republic and Palini e Bertoli in Italy, Tatyanin said.  \"In Europe, we bought assets that were complementary to our\\nexports of semis. You should view Oregon Steel in the same\\npattern,\" he said.  But Tatyanin said mergers between Russia\\'s top steel makers\\nwere unlikely in the near future.  \"For the time being, Russian companies have their own\\nstrategies,\" he said. \"It\\'s unlikely that you will see team-ups\\non the Russian front in the short to medium term.

       "  ' LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) made a 2.7 billion pound ($5.1 billion) offer for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) on Monday to create a trans-Atlantic market, but it was quickly rejected as inadequate. \\n\\n Nasdaq said the deal would create the world\\'s largest exchange by number of listings, over 6,400 companies with a market value of $11.8 trillion, and the most active exchange with average daily volume of 7.4 billion shares traded. This was Nasdaq\\'s second offer since March. LSE shares rose 6 percent after the news. Nasdaq, which on Monday increased its LSE stake to 28.75 percent, said it would pay 1,243 pence per share in cash for the rest of the LSE, Europe\\'s biggest stock market. \"They are chipping away,\" Celent analyst David Easthope said, though he added Nasdaq\\'s \"bid is below the current market value for LSE, given how many suitors LSE has had over the past few years.\" The LSE rejected Nasdaq\\'s offer within seven hours, with Chief Executive Clara Furse saying it \"fails to recognize the outstanding growth record and prospects of our group on a stand-alone basis.\" The move comes as the world\\'s stock markets rush to consolidate, pushed by customers who want lower fees and broader offerings. Last week a group of the world\\'s largest securities dealers announced plans to create a rival European equity trading platform, adding to the pressure. A WHITE KNIGHT IN THE WINGS? The Nasdaq offer sent LSE shares up 6 percent to 1,291 pence, valuing it at about 3.2 billion pounds amid speculation that Nasdaq or another party would bid the price higher. \"Clara Furse will be rushing around to find a white knight, maybe OMX OMX.ST or Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ). Or maybe the board will agree to a higher offer, say around 1,300 pence,\" one senior dealer in London said. The LSE has long been viewed as a takeover target because it is relatively small and growing rapidly. It has rejected approaches from OM Gruppen AB, Deutsche Boerse AG, Macquarie Bank Ltd. and Nasdaq since 2000. But Nasdaq CEO Robert Greifeld told analysts on a conference call on Monday that he was optimistic his company would begin talks with LSE\\'s board soon. The latest offer represents \"a very full price\" at 27.9 times estimated 2007 LSE earnings, he said. Greifeld said Nasdaq\\'s purchase of 7 million shares on Monday from an unnamed long-term investor at 1,243 pence a share showed support for the offer and strengthened its position. \"Getting to 28.75 percent is a good start to this effort,\" he said. \"It gives us tremendous momentum.\" Nasdaq declined to assign a number to the deal\\'s financial impact, though its executives estimated LSE would increase per-share earnings in 12 to 18 months. The offer will officially be made to LSE shareholders this week, Nasdaq said on the call. TRANS-ATLANTIC RACE Nasdaq and archrival NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N, the world\\'s largest stock exchange, have been racing to create the first trans-Atlantic exchange company to expand offerings, attract listings and extend into new markets. Earlier this year, as New York-based Nasdaq built its stake in the LSE, NYSE agreed to acquire Paris-based Euronext ENXT.PA. The NYSE deal, initially valued at $10 billion, is awaiting shareholder approval. NYSE and Euronext have said they aim to have that approval by mid-December. A person familiar with the matter said Nasdaq, which could have bid for LSE next year at a lower price, moved now to take advantage of recent declines in LSE\\'s valuation and to avoid falling behind NYSE in the rush to consolidate. Under UK takeover rules, Nasdaq has to pay at least 1,243 pence per LSE share until the first offer expires next April. Nasdaq\\'s new bid is 40 percent above its previous offer, but close to the level at which the No. 2 U.S. stock market paid for most of its stake. UK Treasury Minister Ed Balls said Britain would not stand in the way of Nasdaq\\'s bid. Moody\\'s Investors Service said it might downgrade Nasdaq\\'s Ba3 debt rating, citing concern the exchange would face increased debt and integration challenges. \"Should the transaction go through, the significant financial leverage will leave Nasdaq little room for error. Execution and rapid de-levering will be key,\" Moody\\'s analyst Peter Nerby said in a note. Nasdaq said it would retain the LSE brand and that the London exchange would continue to be regulated solely by the UK\\'s Financial Services Authority. Greifeld also committed to not raising broker fees for three years.

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Merger and acquisition activity worldwide surged on Monday with a focus on real estate, mining, media and exchanges sectors as demand by private equity funds and the push for industry consolidation gathered pace. \\n\\n In the U.S., private equity fund Blackstone unveiled a real estate deal valued at $20 billion, excluding debt, while mining group Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold agreed to buy copper miner Phelps Dodge Corp for $25.9 billion. But big deals were also unveiled from Australia to London and the total announced globally from early Friday in Europe to 1200 GMT on Monday is around $88.5 billion (including debt), according to financial research firm Dealogic. The surge is being driven by profitable companies which have large amounts of cash for investment, and by the flood of money into private equity funds that also needs to be put to work. \"If you quantify the boom so far, we haven\\'t seen anything yet,\" said Teun Draaisma, head of European equity strategy at Morgan Stanley. Draaisma calculates that European M&A this year is on track to hit $1.2 trillion, matching the record in 2000, but relative to the size of the overall market, the volume of new deals is still below previous peaks. At the time of the last peak in M&A activity there were a lot of hostile deals and many bidders were offering their own stock instead of cash to finance the deal, he said. \"We haven\\'t seen any of that yet, its been mostly smaller companies, quite friendly deals and mostly in cash.\" Nothing we look at suggests we\\'re seeing a peak in the M&A cycle,\" Draaisma said. Dealogic announced last week the value of global mergers and acquisitions for 2006 had reached a record $3.368 trillion, beating the previous high set in 2000 of $3.332 trillion. Private equity firms accounted for 22 percent of total global M&A volume in the first nine months of the year, hitting a new record of $570.1 billion in deals. INVESTORS FEARS MUTED Few investors can see an immediate end to the trend, at least until one of the recent deals turns sour. \"There\\'s an enormous wall of money that has been raised...and that money needs to be invested. Maybe the music will stop when we get a significant (deal) failure,\" said Ted Scott, director at F&C Asset Management\\'s retail funds arm. \"Increasingly they (deals) are becoming more risky and marginal gains are being made. Some of the valuations are quite toppy, to say the least,\" he added. But amid a benign global macroeconomic environment and low interest rates, which have created a wide spread between the cost of debt and the return on equity, deals to consolidate industries and capture cash flows are expected to dominate. In the mining sector the global consolidation story has been running all year as companies scramble to add reserves and capitalize on record high metal prices. Those that don\\'t succeed could become targets themselves. \"The mining sector stocks have all got so much cash on their balance sheets there is a risk they are getting vulnerable,\" said Chris Tinker, equity strategist at inter-dealer broker  ICAP. The Blackstone bid for U.S. office building owner Equity Office Properties sets a benchmark for a takeover by a single private equity fund. The deals values the company at $20 billion, excluding debt, just shy of the $21 billion paid earlier this year for hospital operator HCA Inc but that deal involved three buyout firms. Among other U.S. deals unveiled on Monday, the U.S. stock exchange Nasdaq launched a $5.1 billion deal for the London Stock Exchange, and Bank of America agreed to buy U.S. Trust Corp, the private banking unit of Charles Schwab Corp, for $3.3 billion. Canada\\'s TD Bank Financial Group agreed to buy the 43 percent stake in its U.S. retail banking arm TD Banknorth Inc. it does not already own in a deal worth $3.2 billion. Private equity firm Apax Partners won a tender valued at between $1.04 billion and $1.25 billion to acquire control of Tnuva, Israel\\'s largest food company, according to Israeli media reports.

BNK.N, looking to breathe new life into its U.S. retail banking arm where profits have been falling. \\n\\n TD Bank, which owns about 130 million shares, or 57 percent, of TD Banknorth, will offer $32.33 a share in cash for the minority stake in the Portland, Maine-based bank in which it bought an interest in 2005. The offer represents a 6.5 percent premium over TD Banknorth\\'s closing price of $30.35 a share in New York on Friday. Shares of TD Banknorth closed at $32.18, up 6 percent or $1.83, while shares of TD Bank eased 30 Canadian cents, or 0.4 percent, to C$67.45 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. \"I think $32.33 represents a very fair price today, knowing that this market environment is not going to get better in the near future,\" TD Banknorth Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Ryan said on a conference call. \"We have margin compression, intense competition for loans and deposits, and the inverted yield curve,\" said Ryan, who approached TD Bank this weekend with the buyout offer. An inverted yield curve, where short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates, narrows the gap between what banks can earn on loans and what they pay on deposits. TD Banknorth, facing slowing loan growth and stiff competition, warned last week that fourth-quarter profit could be at the low end of its forecast and said it may close some of its 600 branches to cut costs. \"This (transaction) is no surprise. The timing was always up in the air, but everyone knew this was coming,\" said Kevin Timmons, banking analyst at C.L. King & Associates in Albany, New York. \"TD has long said bank prices in the U.S. were too high, but if we got to a point where the profitability outlook improves, it would probably end up paying more. It is paying less now than if it were to wait.\" The boards of both TD Bank and TD Banknorth have unanimously backed the deal, which also needs the approval of a majority of TD Banknorth\\'s minority shareholders. They are expected to vote on the deal early next year. TD Bank\\'s Chief Financial Officer Colleen Johnston said Private Capital Management, TD Banknorth\\'s biggest shareholder after TD Bank, has agreed to vote its stake of some 18.2 million shares, or about 8 percent, in favor of the deal. She said Ariel Capital Management, which owned 8 million shares, or 3.5 percent, of TD Banknorth at the end of September, according to Reuters data, has also indicated it will back the transaction. TD Bank Chief Executive Ed Clark said TD Banknorth remained a strong platform for growth, despite tough banking conditions in the northeastern United States, which \"could get worse before they get better.\" He said TD Bank aims to slow any further TD Banknorth purchases and build it into \"a better bank rather than a bigger one,\" and that would be easier to do with a 100 percent stake. Clark said management aimed to grow TD Banknorth\\'s earnings by 7 percent to 10 percent a year. However, strong performances from TD Bank\\'s other units would ensure a robust overall performance for TD, which is Canada\\'s second biggest bank by assets. \"Do I believe that next year TD Bank Financial Group can do more than 10 percent earnings growth? I believe the answer to that is \\'yes\\',\" Clark said. Johnston said no management changes were planned at TD Banknorth and Bharat Masrani will become president, as planned, in the fall. TD Bank, which took a majority stake last year in TD Banknorth for $4 billion, expects the deal to add to earnings in 2007 and 2008 even though no meaningful revenue or expense synergies are expected. \"We view this announcement as a positive development for TD as it accretively advances its U.S. commercial banking expansion,\" said Michael Goldberg, an analyst at Desjardins Securities.

( BAC.N ) on Monday said it will buy Charles Schwab Corp.\\'s SCHW.O U.S. Trust Corp. unit for $3.3 billion to expand in the lucrative business of managing money for the rich. \\n\\n The all-cash purchase will vault Bank of America to the top spot in the business known as private banking, with $261 billion of assets under management. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) will be second with $204 billion. Schwab, for its part, is jettisoning a unit catering to multimillionaires to focus on providing low-cost services to ordinary investors who like doing their own trading. Adding the 153-year-old U.S. Trust, a venerable name known for handling money of families like the Astors, \"enhances our credibility\" in wealth management, Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said in a statement. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the No. 2 U.S. bank, is expanding through non-bank purchases in areas where it has not traditionally been dominant, as it nears the regulatory ceiling of 10 percent of all U.S. deposits. The bank is adding 13,600 clients and $94 billion of assets under management from U.S. Trust. Its private bank already has 114,000 customers and $167 billion of assets. Peter Scaturro, U.S. Trust\\'s chief executive, will oversee a combined private banking unit at Bank of America, reporting to wealth and investment management chief Brian Moynihan. \"The idea is to build a dominant wealth-management franchise,\" Scaturro said on a conference call. \"The U.S. is a big place with a lot of money.\" Bank of America said the purchase will result in a $250 million charge, and may add 1 cent per share to earnings by 2008. It expects a closing around March 31. The bank has not decided whether to keep the U.S. Trust name. Assets at Bank of America\\'s wealth-management arm, which includes private banking, would still trail those of Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N, Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). PRICEY? Analysts viewed the transaction as pricey. San Francisco-based Schwab acquired U.S. Trust for $2.9 billion in May 2000, just after an equities bull market crested. \"Schwab is getting a robust price, likely reflecting the potential (for) expense and revenue synergies that never really materialized for Schwab,\" wrote David Trone, a Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc. analyst. The combined business will employ about 4,400 people. Moynihan expects some cost cuts in back-office operations, and \"relatively modest\" attrition among U.S. Trust customers. Schwab will realize a $1.9 billion pre-tax gain and collect $2.5 billion after taxes from the transaction. It will focus on retail investors as intense competition among brokerages drives commissions lower. Bank of America, which operates 5,722 branches, last month started to roll out free online stock trading for customers who deposit $25,000, causing shares of discounters such as Schwab to fall Charles Schwab, who runs his namesake firm, said he plans to remain a U.S. Trust client. He was not immediately available for further comment. In afternoon trading, Schwab shares rose 35 cents to $18.91, while Bank of America rose 20 cents to $55.05. DEPOSIT CAP U.S. Trust was founded in 1853 by industrialist Peter Cooper, railroad developer Erastus Corning, dry goods merchant Marshall Field, and others. Bank of America controls 9.2 percent of U.S. bank deposits and cannot make a purchase that sends it above 10 percent. Adding U.S. Trust\\'s $9 billion leaves \"ample room\" under the cap, the bank\\'s chief financial officer, Alvaro de Molina, told journalists. Northern Trust Corp. ( NTRS.O ) ranks third in U.S. private banking, while Citigroup ranks sixth, Bank of America said. For Scaturro, the merger is a vindication of sorts. Citigroup ousted him in 2004 in an ethics scandal involving its Japanese private bank, without accusing him of wrongdoing. He will now compete directly with his former employer. Schwab itself was bought by Bank of America in 1983 but split off in 1987 in a $280 million management-led buyout. (Additional reporting by  Megan Davies )',\n",
       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co. ( CPB.N ) posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Monday as price increases and new items like low-sodium soups helped lift sales. \\n\\n But the stock was about flat as some analysts questioned the near-term growth potential of a company that already trades at about 20 percent times fiscal year 2007 earnings. \"At some level, the Street is waiting for a big upward earnings/guidance revision that, in our opinion, is not coming due to management\\'s conservatism and long wish list of investments for the future,\" Jonathan Feeney, an analyst at Wachovia, said. he rates the stock \"market weight.\" The company, which makes its namesake soups, Pepperidge Farm cookies and Godiva chocolates, said profit was $291 million, or 72 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter, ended October 29, compared with $302 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company recorded a $47 million tax benefit. Earnings from continuing operations were 66 cents a share, 5 cents better than the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Campbell sold its UK and Ireland businesses in August and used $620 million of the proceeds to buy back shares. Campbell did not lift its full-year earnings forecast despite the solid first quarter and management said on a conference call there were opportunities for the company to spend more to build its business. For the year, Campbell stood by its forecast for an increase of 5 to 7 percent from earnings of $1.73 a share in the prior year, before one-time items. \"The combination of incremental marketing, UK divestiture dilution, diminishing productivity improvements, higher taxes and tougher soup comparisons in the back half of the year will likely limit more meaningful growth in fiscal 2007,\" said Christopher Growe, analyst at A.G. Edwards, in a research note. He rates the stock \"hold.\" Like many food companies, Campbell has raised prices to offset rising costs for energy and ingredients. The company has also been spending money to promote new products, like the low-sodium soups. Initial shipments of the low-sodium soups, which are made with a special sea salt that is lower in sodium, were better than expected, Campbell Chief Executive Douglas Conant said in a news release. First-quarter sales rose 8 percent to $2.15 billion, with price increases adding about 2 percentage points to the rise. Volume and mix, a measure of products sold that factors out currency factors and price increases, rose 4 percent. U.S. soup, sauce and beverage sales also rose 8 percent in the quarter, with profit in that segment up almost 12 percent, the company said. Soup sales alone rose 10 percent, with condensed soup sales up 7 percent and ready-to-eat soups up 15 percent. Baking and snacking sales rose 6 percent, and profit in that unit rose 36 percent, helped by lower marketing costs than a year earlier. Campbell shares were down 4 cents at $37.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Before Monday, the stock was up 26 percent this year, and trading at about 20 times estimated earnings for the current fiscal year, compared with a multiple of 18 for rival General Mills Inc. ( GIS.N ), which makes Progresso soups.',\n",
       "  ' MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - The world\\'s main economies face growing inflation risks but prospects for growth are strong, financial leaders said on Sunday after a meeting that also featured fresh calls for more foreign exchange flexibility. \\n\\n The Group of 20 (G20) countries addressed a raft of financial sore spots ranging from stalled trade talks to currency values, wrapping up a two-day meeting with an upbeat but sober statement. The group did not mention China by name when referring to currency policy, but officials signaled the G20 clearly had the new economic superpower in mind. \"Around a table like that it is well known who has a flexible exchange rate and who doesn\\'t. So without getting too personal when you talk about flexibility for exchange rates, it is well known what\\'s meant,\" Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said. \"As I see it, there was encouragement towards more flexibility, and I think all of the countries agree with that. It is just a question of timing,\" said Costello, whose country was host to the meeting. In a communique, the G20 spoke of strong growth and highlighted the danger of inflation. \"We need to take advantage of the present strength in the global economy to get policy settings right,\" it said. Interest rates throughout the industrialized and developing world have been rising this year and last, but they have been coming off of historically low levels. What is more, following wild gyrations in the prices of oil and commodities, ministers voiced concern about inflation rearing its head. \"Faced with potential inflationary pressures, the normalization of monetary policy underway in many G20 countries will need to continue,\" the group said. A Brazilian official, however, later told reporters that both Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank (ECB) President Jean-Claude Trichet were positive on inflation. \"Mr. Bernanke was optimistic about inflation in America,\" Brazil\\'s Secretary for International Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Luiz Melin said after the meeting. \"Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet also mentioned that as far as the ECB was concerned, while they cannot afford to be complacent, they were also very happy about that (inflation).\" The G20 includes major economies such as the United States and Japan, as well as big emerging powers such as China and India. Together, its members represent 85 percent of global economic output. CLASHES OUTSIDE, CIVILITY INSIDE About 5,000 people had marched through Australia\\'s second city on the first day of the meeting, chanting anti-G20 slogans, while a small group of protesters clashed with police and smashed up a police riot truck. There was no sign of violence on Sunday as the meeting drew to a close. In contrast to the conflict outside of the hotel where the meeting was staged, ministers inside spoke of polite cooperation. South Africa Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said member countries are realistic about the obstacles against more free-floating currencies. \"What doesn\\'t happen at G20 is a Monty Python-esque beating up of countries. I think that we allow ourselves to see there are difficulties in a number of countries. Whether you are talking energy or exchange rates, there is nothing to suggest that we convened in order to beat up on China.\" The United States had vowed to discuss currency flexibility with China, which critics have complained keeps its yuan too low to boost its exports. But U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt, in a statement after the meeting, did not mention China, instead only saying G20 members were pleased to hear from the United States about its strong and healthy growth. The communique called for \"appropriate\" exchange rate flexibility. \"Maintaining strong world growth and containing inflation will require ongoing adjustments to monetary and fiscal policies while ensuring appropriate exchange rate flexibility and structural reform,\" it said. Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui said it had not been written with any specific country\\'s policy in mind. While China\\'s currency regime is arguably the most prominent source of economic debate, policy makers have also been increasingly focused on Japan\\'s weak yen, which has raised the ire of European authorities because of its effect on trade. One reason for the yen\\'s fragility has been Japan\\'s ultra-low interest rates. The BOJ only recently increased rates to 0.25 percent from virtually zero after seven years of deflation. Fukui said he had told G20 members Japan will continue to adjust monetary policy gradually to keep its economy recovering. REVIVING TRADE TALKS Sensing a window of opportunity may be closing soon, the G20 called for an early resumption of talks to revive the Doha round of trade negotiations. The talks are aimed at a package that could help lift millions out of poverty, but they have stalled as major trading powers have refused to make big concessions. \"It is urgent that we get the Doha round restarted,\" Costello said. \"To break the impasse on agriculture will require new concessions in Europe, counterbalancing concessions in America.\" Ministers have warned that a failure to get Doha going could seriously dent the world economy\\'s long-term prospects. For now, though, the overall view among member countries was of optimism over growth prospects. \"G20 members noted that the world economy continues to expand at a solid pace, with growth above its long-term average for the fourth consecutive year,\" the group said.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. blue chips ended lower on Monday as buyers took money out of stocks after a series of record-high closes and a drop in oil prices hit energy shares. \\n\\n U.S. stocks had started higher after a flurry of corporate deals, but traders said the market lost steam throughout the day. A brokerage upgrade of Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) helped the Nasdaq end slightly higher. \"This market is so stretched, I think a lot of people are waiting for any kind of break in it and are a bit leery,\" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global Advisors in Plymouth, Massachusetts. \"We\\'re overdue for a kind of a sell-off.

Shares of General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) were the biggest weight on the Dow, falling 3.4 percent to $34.18, after an executive from the No. 1 U.S. carmaker said it is open to a deal with its No. 2 rival Ford ( F.N ). Traders said a tie-up would be viewed negatively by GM shareholders. Ford shares fell 2.5 percent to $8.67 on the NYSE. Oil for January delivery CLc1 ended down 19 cents a barrel at $58.78 a barrel on ample supplies and concern about demand. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), the world\\'s largest publicly traded oil company, dipped 0.9 percent to $72.43 and was the top negative influence on the S&P 500. Helping the Nasdaq, Credit Suisse lifted its investment rating on Microsoft, sending the company\\'s shares up 1.7 percent to $29.89. The software company\\'s shares earlier touched a two-year high of $30.  On Friday, the S&P 500 index finished above the 1,400 mark for the first time in six years and the Dow climbed to its 18th record close since the beginning of October. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index .VIX -- known as the market fear gauge -- closed below 10 on Monday for the first time since January 1994, suggesting stocks\\' month-long rally may have further to go. But traders said some investors were taking profits on Monday, which was a light trading day before Thursday\\'s Thanksgiving holiday, despite the usually positive news of corporate deal making. Among the biggest deals were a proposed $19 billion buyout for office building owner Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N from the Blackstone Group and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.\\'s ( FCX.N ) $25.9 billion bid for much larger Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N. <ID:nN20230145> <ID:nN2029LJG4>.

Phelps Dodge shares shot up 26.8 percent to $120.47, while Freeport-McMoRan shares dipped 3.1 percent to $55.63. In another major deal, Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) made a $5.1 billion bid for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) to create a trans-Atlantic market, but the London exchange rejected Nasdaq\\'s offer. Shares of Nasdaq rose 3.1 percent to $37.71. Bank of America Corp.\\'s ( BAC.N ) also agreed to buy to buy Charles Schwab Corp.\\'s SCHW.O U.S. Trust Corp. wealth management unit for $3.3 billion. Bank of America shares rose 0.1 percent to $54.90, while Charles Schwab shares climbed 2.1 percent to $18.94.

       "  \" SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Shares in Australia's Seven Network Ltd. SEV.AX have been placed on a trading halt pending the release of an announcement from the company. \\n\\n The Australian Financial Review reported on Monday that Seven was in talks with private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts on a A$3.5 billion ($2.7 billion) deal to go private.\",\n",
       "  ' MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL is setting up a A$4 billion ($3.1 billion) joint venture with Australia\\'s Seven Network Ltd. SEV.AX in TV, magazines and online businesses, marking the U.S. group\\'s first foray into Australia\\'s media sector. \\n\\n Shares in Australia\\'s second-ranked TV broadcaster, controlled by media mogul Kerry Stokes, soared 17 percent to a record high of A$12.41 and closed up 12 percent at A$11.80, giving the group a market value of A$2.6 billion. KKR is the third major private equity group to grab a piece of the Australian media industry following the passage of a law easing restrictions on foreign and cross-ownership of newspapers, radio and TV stations. The move cashes up Seven for takeovers next year, when the law comes into effect allowing owners of one media platform -- newspapers, radio or television -- to own a second platform in the same market. \"The business has tremendous momentum and is well positioned to benefit from changes in the media environment,\" KKR founding partner George Roberts said in a statement. KKR is investing A$735 million for a 50 percent stake in the joint venture, Seven Media Group, while Seven Network will receive cash proceeds of about A$3.2 billion for its assets going into the venture and will hold a 50 percent stake in it. The venture will own Seven\\'s television and magazines businesses and its 50 percent interest in the Yahoo!7 online joint venture. Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Mizuho ( 8411.T ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ) are underwriting the deal, lending A$2.5 billion. For Seven shareholders, the main issue now is how Seven will invest the A$3.2 billion it has fetched to build on its track record of creating value. \"The question the market will ask is whether that can continue, given the scarcity of media assets out there,\" said Jack Chemello, an analyst with fund manager BT Financial Group, which holds shares in Seven. He said while Australia\\'s media heavyweights and private equity groups had a lot of firepower for acquisitions, Australia\\'s A$12 billion media industry had too few assets to fill their appetite. \"It could see valuations pushed even higher for those few scarce assets that potentially could be in play,\" Chemello said. PRIVATE EQUITY PUSH The new media law has opened the door to the big private equity investors offshore who are hunting for media assets. KKR was reportedly pipped at the post last month when CVC Asia Pacific CVC.UL took a 50 percent stake in a TV, magazine and Internet joint venture with Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd. PBL.AX, controlled by Australia\\'s richest man, James Packer. Providence Equity Partners, considered a leading investor in media, is backing a plan by Irish media group Independent News and Media INWS.I to buy out regional newspaper group APN News & Media Ltd. ( APN.AX ). KKR and Providence were beaten last week in an $18.7 billion bid to buy out the No.1 U.S. radio station operator, Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ). An industry source said Seven talked exclusively to KKR on the joint venture plan. \"KKR has invested in every possible media platform. There\\'s a strong mix in this transaction. They\\'re backing Seven\\'s management,\" said the industry source, who declined to be named. Seven was advised by Morgan Stanley and KKR was advised by O\\'Sullivan Pullini. Seven grabbed a 14.9 percent stake in West Australian Newspapers Holdings Ltd. WAN.AX last month, which it said on Monday it would retain. Other industry heavyweights have been maneuvering ahead of Australia\\'s anticipated media shake-up. Rupert Murdoch\\'s News Corp. NWS.N bought a 7.5 percent stake in its main Australian newspaper rival John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. ( FXJ.AX ) and Macquarie Media Group MMG.AX bought a 13.8 percent stake in radio and TV station owner Southern Cross Broadcasting Ltd. SBC.AX. KKR has been scouring Australia for media and retail assets, after making its first investment in the country in June buying the Cleanaway waste management business and an industrial services business from Brambles Industries Ltd. BIL.AX for A$1.83 billion. It led an A$18.2 billion bid for Australian retailer Coles Myer Ltd. CML.AX, but withdrew it last month after the Coles board balked. ($1=A$1.30)',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc. said on Monday that it struck a deal with the publishers of 176 U.S. newspapers to let them use its technology to sell help-wanted advertising and offer a variety of local information services. \\n\\n The move is an attempt by Yahoo to expand its reach into local markets, viewed as a key growth prospect as it battles rivals such as Google Inc. for advertising dollars. For publishers, it is a bid to expand their audience and advertising revenue as more readers drop the print editions of their papers in favor of getting their news and classified ads from the Internet. The publishers include Belo Corp., Cox Newspapers Inc., Hearst Newspapers, Journal Register Co., Lee Enterprises Inc., MediaNews Group and E.W. Scripps Co.. Their newspapers circulate in 38 U.S. states, and include major metropolitan dailies such as the San Francisco Chronicle, the Dallas Morning News and the Los Angeles Daily News. \"We believe the local segment is largely untapped and provides significant opportunities to expand audience engagement and subsequently grow local advertising,\" Yahoo Chief Executive Terry Semel said in a statement. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. In a key element, advertisers who list jobs in the papers will also be able to post them on Yahoo\\'s HotJobs Web site, potentially widening the appeal of print help-wanted ads, which have lost ground in recent years to online recruiting sites. That arrangement grew out of an existing deal between HotJobs, MediaNews and Belo. The papers also will use Yahoo\\'s technology to sell ads on their Web sites, and offer search functions, local listings, maps and event calendars. Newspaper articles will also be distributed across Yahoo\\'s news and other sites. The job ads will begin running in December. The companies plan to release more details about search and other technology next year. \"The bottom line is that these newspaper companies have decided to answer the \\'friend or foe\\' question that all traditional media companies face regarding online players,\" UBS analyst Brian Schachter wrote in an investor note. \"They have decided it is better to be friends with Yahoo.\" Newspapers have reported falling ad revenue or weak growth across their ad segments, including help-wanted advertising. Their Web sites, however, have been posting strong ad growth. The deal serves as a riposte to an announcement by search and advertising rival Google earlier this month that it would help customers buy advertisements in 50 U.S. newspapers. They include prominent names like Tribune Co.\\'s Chicago Tribune, the Philadelphia Inquirer and The New York Times Co.\\'s Boston Globe. The Yahoo deal also can help boost HotJobs\\' prominence in the online classifieds market. The service has been overshadowed by competitors such as CareerBuilder, which is owned by Gannett, Tribune and McClatchy Co., as well as Monster Worldwide Inc.\\'s Monster.com. CareerBuilder has about 32 percent of the North American revenue among job sites, followed by Monster.com at 31 percent and HotJobs at 9 percent, according to the Morgan Stanley Publishing Handbook. Newspapers have struggled over the past decade to form online advertising networks to act as a bulwark against Web challengers. The New Century Network was formed in 1995 by nine newspaper chains, only to shut down in 1998. Real Cities is another such venture backed by rival U.S. newspaper chains. Yahoo shares were off 16 cents at $26.75 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq stock market. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg  and Nick Zieminski)',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK/TORONTO  (Reuters) - Only three months after coming under intense pressure from disgruntled shareholders for making an expensive bid for two major Canadian mining companies, the chief executive of Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N has turned the firm\\'s fortunes around. \\n\\n Steven Whisler is creating the largest North American-based mining company by selling his U.S.-based copper producer to compatriot Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) for $25.9 billion. The news sent Phelps\\' stock up 27 percent to $120.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Freeport was down 3 percent at $55.63. The only downside is that Whisler, who has spent the last three decades working for Phelps, will not hold a position at the new Freeport-McMoRan. Instead he will retire after the transition period. \"I get the feeling that the old boys wanted to get out, and now they can say \\'We did a good deal for our shareholders,\\' declare victory and leave,\" said John Kinsey, portfolio manager with Caldwell Securities in Toronto, which previously held shares of Inco, Falconbridge and Phelps. In an uncharacteristic gamble earlier this year, Whisler made a $40 billion mostly stock bid for Canada\\'s Inco Ltd. N.TO, the second largest nickel producer in the world, and Falconbridge, a major copper and nickel producer. Phelps stock dropped 8 percent after it announced plans to buy the two miners and Whisler was grilled by the investment community. One vocal shareholder wanted the company to buy back shares instead, and publicly slammed the deal. Phelps would have had to take on billions of dollars in debt to complete the deal and several analysts characterized the move as a heavy bet on long-term commodity prices. \"He was betting his company, his job and his career; he went all the way out,\" said one source familiar with the Inco-Falconbridge-Phelps negotiations. \"He was battered by shareholders after the announcement.\" To add to the discontent, during the second quarter, when most miners were reporting record earnings because of strong metal prices, Phelps reported a sharp drop in profit because of its hedging strategy. \"I think he has fallen. His reputation is not the same,\" said the source. In the end, Whisler lost Inco to Brazilian iron ore giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce ( VALE5.SA ) ( RIO.N ) and lost Falconbridge to Swiss-based Xstrata Plc XTA.L. Whisler\\'s attempt to form the largest mining company in North America could transform his reputation as a steady leader best known for guiding Phelps Dodge through a difficult period when metal prices dipped as he took over as CEO six and a half years ago, industry watchers said. Now, Phelps shareholders will receive $88 in cash plus 0.67 common shares of Freeport for every share held. Based on Friday\\'s closing prices, that values the offer at $126.46 a share and represents a premium of 33 percent. \"It\\'s a good deal for Phelps because of the premium,\" said Kerry Smith, an analyst with Haywood Securities in Toronto. Whisler, who has been an employee of Phelps Dodge since 1976, has portrayed himself as a careful executive with strong financial discipline. In a 2001 commencement address delivered to the Colorado School of Mines, he said he subscribed to famed American humorist Will Rogers\\' investment theory: \"Don\\'t gamble. Take all your savings and buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up. Then sell it. If it don\\'t go up, don\\'t buy it.\" He also advised graduates to \"ride the ups and downs\" of their careers -- \"because like all of us, you will have plenty.\"',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) said it agreed to buy much larger Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N for $25.9 billion in cash and stock to create the world\\'s largest publicly traded copper company. \\n\\n The agreement is the latest multi-billion dollar takeover deal in the global mining industry, which has been consolidating as companies scramble to add reserves and try to capitalize on record high metal prices. Copper now trades at $6,765, down from a record of $8,800 in May but up 53 percent on the year. \"This kind of big merger could raise the company\\'s ability to take advantage in price negotiations, therefore this should be positive for copper prices,\" said Naohiro Niimura, director at Barclays Capital Japan Ltd. \"In the current bearish trend, the market is not too sensitive about buying copper actively, but in the medium- and long-term it should be positive.\" Freeport-McMoRan will pay a total of $126.46 per Phelps Dodge share, a premium of 33 percent to Phelps Dodge\\'s November 17 closing price. Phelps Dodge share holders will receive $88 per share and 0.67 of a common share of Freeport-McMoRan. In all, Freeport is paying $18 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in shares. The takeover price values Phelps Dodge at around 8 times forecast 2006 earnings, compared with forward price earnings ratios of 8 for Freeport and 9 for diversified miners BHP Billiton Ltd. BPH.L and Rio Tinto Plc ( RIO.L ). Freeport-McMoRan operates the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, which it said is the world\\'s largest copper and gold mine in terms of reserves. Phelps Dodge has mines in North and South America and Africa. The combined company would produce a net 3.1 billion pounds of copper and a net 1.7 million ounces of gold this year. Combined reserves would total 75 billion pounds of copper and 41 million ounces of gold. \"This acquisition is financially compelling for FCX shareholders, who will benefit from significant cash-flow accretion, lower cost of capital, and improved geographic and asset diversification,\" Freeport-McMoRan Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in a statement. Freeport-McMoRan has received financing commitments from JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) and Merrill Lynch MER.N to finance the deal\\'s $18 billion cash portion. Its debt would stand at $17.6 billion after the transaction. The company said it would issue 137 million shares to Phelps Dodge shareholders, resulting in Phelps Dodge stockholders owning 38 percent of the combined company. MINING MERGERS Phelps had been rumored to be a takeover target of Grupo Mexico, while Phelps itself had been trying to buy two Canadian companies, Inco Ltd. N.TO and Falconbridge Ltd. in a stock and cash deal worth $40 billion. But Phelps lost the nickel and copper producers to all-cash offers from Brazil\\'s Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) ( VALE5.SA ) and Swiss-based Xstrata Plc. Inco is now controlled by CVRD and Falconbridge has been taken over by Xstrata XTA.L. The boards of Freeport-McMoRan and Phelps Dodge have both unanimously approved the terms of the agreement and have recommended that their shareholders approve the transaction. The deal is subject to approval of both firms\\' shareholders and regulators. The transaction is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of 2007. For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2006, the companies had combined revenues of $16.6 billion. For the entire year of 2006, the two companies are expected to generate estimated combined operating cash flows totaling $6.5 billion. Freeport\\'s Adkerson will be the chief executive of the combined company, while Freeport Chairman James Moffett will continue in that role. J. Steven Whisler, Phelps Dodge chairman and CEO, is expected to retire after 30 years at the company. Freeport-McMoRan is being advised by JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch, while Phelps Dodge is being advised by Citigroup ( C.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). Phelps has been under pressure from shareholders, including activist stockholder Atticus Capital, which owns nearly 10 percent of the company and had been seeking a buyer for Phelps. Atticus began agitating for change early in 2006 and helped derail the company\\'s plans to buy Inco and Falconbridge, calling on it instead to buy back shares or consider selling itself.',\n",

The deal is also one of the largest in a string of leveraged buyouts by Blackstone and other funds. \"There\\'s still a tremendous appetite for real estate by institutional investors,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Paul Adornato said. Equity Office has been the subject of buyout rumors for the past few months as private funds, including Blackstone, have snapped up publicly traded REITs. Blackstone said the cash offer of $48.50 per share -- an 8.5 percent premium to the stock\\'s closing price -- valued Equity Office at nearly $20 billion, including all of the company\\'s securities. Including the assumption of debt, the deal is worth $36 billion, surpassing the combined $35 billion in private equity deals announced for 16 REITs since the beginning of 2005, Adornato said. Equity Office shares were up 7.9 percent, or $3.55, at $48.27 in late-afternoon trading. Other REITs, such as SL Green Realty Corp. ( SLG.N ), Federal Realty Investment Trust ( FRT.N ), Public Storage Inc. ( PSA.N ) and REIT fund manager Cohen & Steers Inc. ( CNS.N ) also rose, putting them among the top gainers on the Big Board. BLACKSTONE\\'S RECORD Blackstone has raised more than $67 billion for alternative asset investing, including almost $13 billion for real estate. The firm has a long track record of investing in office buildings, hotels and other commercial properties. It recently acquired office REIT Trizec Properties Inc. for $4.8 billion, plus the assumption of $4.1 billion in debt. In July, Blackstone bought office property owner CarrAmerica Realty Corp. for $5.6 billion. Many deals have been driven by the amount of debt buyers can use and the luxury of being able to wait for property values to rise, said Jahn Brodwin, a partner in The Schonbraun McCann Group, which advises REITs and fund sponsors. \"I think Wall Street tends to be a little bit myopic at times,\" Brodwin said. \"They don\\'t look out far enough.\" Blackstone and other private buyers typically buy large portfolios of property and sell the buildings individually or in groups, a \"buy wholesale, sell retail\" strategy. Markets such as New York and Washington, D.C. have seen vacancy rates tumble since the office market bottomed out at the end of 2002. Equity Office\\'s other markets -- like Boston and San Francisco -- have recovered as soon or as quickly. \"If you look at EOP\\'s weakest markets, (Blackstone) thinks they\\'ve got farther to go than the (stock) market\\'s pricing suggests,\" Feldman said. \"If they\\'re not recovering faster, then they\\'re making a bet that they can hold on to great real estate for a long time if they have to.\" Unlike publicly traded REITs, private buyers can finance their purchases by using more than 90 percent debt, allowing them to boost the return on their own money they use. Public markets frown upon the use of more than 50 percent debt. \"These facts make it possible for large transactions like was are seeing today,\" Adornato said. \"We believe that the skills and strengths of Equity Office will greatly enhance our existing office platform, which has been expanded through our recent acquisitions of CarrAmerica and Trizec,\" Blackstone Senior Managing Director Jonathan Gray said in a statement. Foreign investors and pension funds also have been pouring more of their funds into real estate to diversify their investments. REITs also have been active in acquiring their rivals, making a dozen such purchases valued at a combined $40 billion in the past two years, Adornato said. Founded by real estate magnate Sam Zell in 1976, Equity Office in 2001 became the first REIT to join the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index  .SPX . The Chicago-based company has interests in 581 buildings, comprising 109 million square feet, in 16 states and the District of Columbia. Equity Office\\'s board has approved the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter. The company said neither management nor trustees were part of the buying group. For the past five years, Equity Office has been exiting noncore markets in the Midwest and South and purchasing buildings in high rent growth markets. It also cut its dividend, one of the most investor-alluring features of a  REIT. \"In some ways, EOP was a broken REIT,\" Adornato said. Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N advised Equity Office. Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ), Bank of America ( BAC.N ), Bear Stearns BSC.N, Blackstone Corporate Advisory and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) were financial advisers to Blackstone. Acquisition financing will be led by Goldman, Bank of America and Bear Stearns. (Additional reporting by  Megan Davies ,  Mark McSherry )',\n",

Protect Data\\'s shares closed at 175.50 crowns on Friday. Protect Data\\'s board of directors unanimously recommends the offer, and it is also supported by Protect Data\\'s largest shareholder, Monterro Holding Ltd, which owns 10.46 percent. Protect Data is the owner of Pointsec Mobile Technologies. Israel-based Check Point said the proposed acquisition of Pointsec, a provider of data security on laptop and desktop PCs, PDAs and smartphones, was the first step in its strategy to secure all enterprise data. \"With businesses facing increasingly severe consequences from data breaches and a stricter regulatory environment, it is apparent that protection must extend beyond the infrastructure to the data itself,\" Gil Shwed, chief executive officer of Check Point, said in a statement. Pointsec provides automatic data encryption solutions that provide protection at the endpoint. The expansion of network access to mobile workers is driving demand to secure all devices that connect to the corporate network, Check Point said. In the first nine months of 2006, Protect Data\\'s revenues grew by 92 percent to 370.8 million crowns. After-tax income for the first nine months grew by 166 percent to 58.7 million crowns. \"After an evaluation process of the strategic alternatives for the company, both our board of directors and I believe this opportunity represents the best strategy for Protect Data, its customers, shareholders and employees,\" said Martin Bjaringer, chairman of Protect Data\\'s board.

       "  ' ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer Lowe\\'s Cos. ( LOW.N ) on Monday posted a better-than-expected third-quarter profit as it controlled costs, but sales disappointed as the cooling U.S. housing market hurt consumer spending. \\n\\n The second-largest home improvement chain behind Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) again cut its full-year profit and sales outlooks, yet Lowe\\'s shares rose more than 1 percent as analysts had expected weak results. \"Investors are looking ahead to next year, when six to nine months from now, these negative results will become easier comparisons,\" said Dan Popowics, an equity analyst with Fifth Third Asset Management. Earnings were $716 million, or 46 cents a share, for the third quarter that ended November 3, up 11 percent from $646 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 43 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 5.8 percent to $11.2 billion, shy of analysts\\' estimates of $11.5 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important retail gauge, fell 4 percent, the first decline in this measure for Lowe\\'s since the first quarter of 2001. Lowe\\'s and Home Depot benefited from strong U.S. home sales and hurricane-related demand a year ago, but now face difficult comparisons as the housing market cools. Atlanta-based Home Depot missed Wall Street estimates last week by reporting a 3 percent drop in third-quarter profit and pared its forecasts for full-year profit and sales growth, saying the housing-related weakness would continue into 2007. Lowe\\'s, which is adding stores in big U.S. cities such as New York, said fewer damaging hurricanes and lower lumber prices also hurt third-quarter sales as the average store purchase fell. It forecast a 4 percent to 6 percent same-store sales decline for the fourth quarter. Housing turnover has fallen \"more than we anticipated,\" Lowe\\'s Chairman Robert Niblock said in an interview. \"By the middle of next year I think we will have cycled through that in most markets, and as we go into the second half (of 2007) we would expect to return to positive\" same-store sales. Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe\\'s cut its full-year profit forecast to $1.95 to $1.97 a share, and said it expects fourth-quarter profit of 36 cents to 38 cents a share. Lowe\\'s said the fourth quarter and year would include one less week because of a calendar shift. Analysts on average expect profit of 41 cents a share for the fourth quarter and $1.97 a share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. In September, Lowe\\'s had said annual earnings would be near the low end of a range of $2 to $2.07 a share. \"I do expect better results out of Lowe\\'s\" longer-term, said Popowics, the Fifth Third Asset Management analyst. \"Home Depot is in more of a turnaround process with their stores and Lowe\\'s in contrast is growing quicker,\" he added. Lowe\\'s shares rose 37 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $30.85 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Home Depot was up 25 cents at $38.53. Lowe\\'s stock is down 8 percent so far this year, while Home Depot is off 5 percent.',\n",

Analysts expect a profit of $1.16 in 2007 and $1.23 in 2006, according to Reuters Estimates. Over the past few years, Xerox has banked on new digital printers, color and office systems in an effort to boost profits and increase market share. Gross profit from color pages is five times greater than black-and-white. The company estimated the color printing market for businesses to be about $21 billion. \"Color pages are up 39 percent through the third quarter of this year and now represent 9 percent of Xerox\\'s total pages, more than double from two years ago,\" the company said in a statement. \"Color now represents 34 percent of the company\\'s total revenue.\" Xerox also reiterated fourth-quarter guidance, expecting earnings in a range of 21 cents to 24 cents per share, including restructuring charges of about 13 per share. Excluding restructuring, Xerox expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 34 cents to 37 cents per share. According to Reuters Estimates, analysts, on average, expect a profit of 37 cent in the fourth quarter. Xerox said it is on track to generate between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion in cash from core operations this year and expects the same for 2007. Xerox said it will expand its $1.5 billion stock repurchase plan, originally announced in October 2005, by $500 million.

To achieve that goal Cummins, which has invested $195 \\nmillion in China since the mid-1990s, plans to spend roughly \\n$100 million more to develop its research and manufacturing \\nfacilities in the country, he said.  The U.S. company, which competes with international and \\nlocal rivals such as Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) and Weichai Power \\nCo. Ltd. ( 2338.HK ) in China, operates three engine joint \\nventures in the country with partners including Dongfeng Motor, \\nChina\\'s third largest vehicle maker.  Earlier this year, Cummins won approval for a $240 million \\nengine joint venture with pickup and truck maker Beiqi Foton \\nMotor Co. Ltd. ( 600166.SS ).\\n  BEEFING UP CHINA SOURCING  Like other foreign auto equipment makers, Cummins is also \\ncounting on China as one of its low-cost purchasing bases.  Local procurement is expected to top $100 million this year \\nand could rise further to $300 million by 2008-2009 and $500 \\nmillion by 2010, despite appreciation of the Chinese currency, \\nWang said.  China\\'s yuan has appreciated 3 percent against the U.S. \\ndollar since it was revalued and freed from a dollar peg in \\nJuly 2005. The appreciation could accelerate as Beijing eases \\nits grip on the foreign exchange system, analysts say.  Although the currency issue will play a role in Cummins\\'s \\nfuture buying decisions, Wang expects China to remain a \\nlow-cost sourcing base given the economies of scale offered by \\nthe country\\'s fast-growing automotive and component industries.  \"We believe China could still provide the cost advantage, \\nat least in the next five to 10 years,\" he said.',\n",

Reilly did not say how much the firm would spend on the \\nengine unit but said a typical investment was $300-$400 \\nmillion.  In August, GM said it would invest more than $300 million \\nin the Talegaon plant for an initial capacity of about 140,000 \\nunits, which would help meet its goal of raising market share \\nto 10 percent by 2010, from 2.3 percent.  \"This facility represents a key part of GM\\'s strategy of \\nestablishing a presence in a fast-growing market.

NOVL.O, one of \\nthe providers of Linux, in which Novell paid a lump sum in \\nreturn for a guarantee that Microsoft would not sue Novell\\'s \\nclients for what it calls a violation of its own patents in the \\nLinux program.  Eban Moglen, one of the pioneers of free software, said \\nMicrosoft\\'s deal skirts the requirements of the GNU General \\nPublic License, used by Linux and other free programs, which \\nrequires the software to be given away.  He said he and others have started work on updating the \\nlicense to close the loophole by inserting a clause stating \\nthat a promise not to sue, such as the one given by Microsoft, \\nwould be automatically applicable to everyone.  That would effectively flip Microsoft\\'s agreement on its \\nhead and guarantee that no one would face a suit from Microsoft \\nif anyone were protected.  \"A clause like that would not be difficult to get community \\nagreement on these days,\" Moglen said, adding that a change \\ncould be ready in weeks or months.  A spokesman for Novell, Bruce Lowry, said: \"We don\\'t want \\nto speculate on what would happen under the next version of the \\nGNU General Public License because things are still in motion.\" \\nMicrosoft had no comment.  In the meantime, the prospect of a drawn-out legal battle \\nwith Microsoft, an experienced litigator, could push users of \\nLinux into the hands of Novell and away from dominant Linux \\nprovider Red Hat Inc. RHAT.O, which does not have such a deal \\nwith Microsoft.  Although Linux is free, providers of the system offer the \\nsoftware with packaging, documentation and -- most important -- \\ninstallation and maintenance, so that any client shift from Red \\nHat would cost it money.  \"Either customers desert Red Hat to go to Novell, to get \\nsafety, or Red Hat will be forced into a similar deal with \\nMicrosoft,\" said Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School and \\nfounding director of the Software Freedom Law Center in New \\nYork.\\n  LIABILITY?  Under the Novell deal, in which both companies agreed not \\nto sue each other\\'s clients for patent violation, Microsoft \\nagreed to pay Novell $348 million, with Novell paying Microsoft \\n$40 million, on the basis that Novell has fewer customers.  Microsoft is paying $108 million for the non-litigation \\nagreement and the rest for Linux subscriptions for resale or \\ndistribution to its customers.  Microsoft says it has patent rights to some of the \\ntechnology in Linux, although it has never said exactly what \\nthose rights might be or what patents are involved.  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said if customers \\nbought Linux from anyone but Novell, they could face trouble.  \"If a customer says: \\'Look, do we have liability for the \\nuse of your patented work?\\' Essentially, if you\\'re using \\nnon-SUSE Linux, then I\\'d say the answer is yes,\" Ballmer told \\neWeek.com recently, referring to the Linux system sold by \\nNovell.  \"I suspect that (customers) will take that issue up with \\ntheir distributor,\" Ballmer said, adding that if customers \\nconsidered doing a direct download of a non-SUSE Linux version, \\n\"they\\'ll think twice about that.\"  Microsoft makes the Windows operating system, for which it \\ncharges billions of dollars a year, but Linux has been a thorn \\nin the software giant\\'s side because it is freely available.

NEC, which had to restate past earnings for the second time\\nthis year and abandon four decades of using U.S. accounting\\npractices, lowered its full-year forecast to a group net profit\\nof 18 billion yen ($152.5 million).  This was down from a July forecast of 50 billion yen, which\\nwas in line with market consensus, under U.S. accounting rules.  Costs at Japan\\'s third-largest electronics conglomerate rose\\nafter booking product development costs at the start of research\\nunder Japanese rules, instead of at the time of mass production\\nunder U.S. rules, NEC said.  \"Without the accounting switch, you would have seen we were\\non track with our forecasts for our core businesses,\" NEC\\nExecutive Vice President Yasuo Matoi told reporters.  Conservative bookkeeping for deferred tax assets and\\nwarranty costs contributed to the first-half net loss, but\\noperating profit rose 22.5 percent from the year-ago period on\\nimproved sales of base stations at home and wireless access\\nsystems overseas, he said.  But sales in mobile phones, one of the areas NEC aims to\\nturn around for a company-wide rebound, fell 25.4 percent,\\ncausing operating losses in NEC\\'s mobile segment to grow to 41\\nbillion yen from 16.9 billion yen in the year-ago period.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Advanced Medical Optics Inc. EYE.N on Tuesday recalled almost 3 million units of its Complete MoisturePlus contact lens solution due to sterility problems that could lead to eye infections, the second major recall of a contact lens solution this year. \\n\\n The company, whose shares fell 9 percent on the news and a related decision to slash its 2006 profit forecast, said three lots made in China and sold in Japan were found to have bacterial contamination. Most of the recalled 2.9 million units were shipped to Japan and other parts of Asia, while the company said it was recalling 183,000 units in the United States. \"We had a handful of adverse-event complaints in China and one in Japan, which involved minor eye redness, irritation and blurred vision,\" Chris Muller, a senior marketing executive at Advanced Medical, told Reuters. He said there have been no such complaints in the United States related to the recalled lots. The solution had been contaminated by ralstonia bacteria, water-borne organisms that are not commonly associated with eye infections but do pose possible eye risk, Muller said. \"Non-sterility of a contact lens solution may have serious health consequences, including eye infection and microbial keratitis,\" the company said, though it considered the likelihood of harm to be \"low.\" The company has halted all manufacturing at the China factory to clean it, which it expects to take 10 to 12 weeks. The announcement comes just six months after the global recall by rival Bausch & Lomb Inc. BOL.N of its ReNu with MoistureLoc contact lens solution after it was linked to keratitis, or inflammation of the cornea, caused by a fungus. ReNu with MoistureLoc had annual sales of $100 million. Analysts have estimated Bausch & Lomb faces up to $1 billion in potential liability from the infections. Bausch & Lomb, beset with accounting irregularities, said this month it expects to report lower third-quarter earnings largely due to the recall. Advanced Medical posted eye-care sales of $209 million in the first nine months of 2006, and the business accounts for about 28 percent of total company sales. The recalled contact lens solution is the company\\'s biggest eye-care product. In view of its own recall, Advanced Medical now expects 2006 earnings per share, excluding special items, of $1.30 to $1.40, compared with a prior forecast of $1.85 to $1.90. Analysts had predicted an EPS of $1.88, according to Reuters Estimates. The Santa Ana, California-based company sees 2007 EPS of $1.85 to $2.00, down from the $2.25 to $2.35 forecast earlier. Analysts were expecting $2.28, according to Reuters Estimates. For the rest of 2006 and 2007, Advanced Medical projected recall-related costs and charges of $35 million to $40 million. It now expects 2006 revenue of $985 million to $1 billion, below a previous forecast of up to $1.02 billion. For 2007, the company projects revenue of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion, compared with its previous forecast of up to $1.1 billion. Advanced Medical shares fell as much as $4.85 to a 13-month low of $34.40 on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of rival Alcon Inc. ACL.N rose 5.9 percent to $107.70. Bank of America analyst David Maris said sales of Alcon\\'s contact lens solutions should benefit from the recalls. \"From the Bausch & Lomb example, we have seen that it is difficult to recover from market share losses,\" he said in a research note.

Boeing shares rose 85 cents $89.98 on the New York Stock Exchange, after hitting an all-time high of $90.15. The stock is up about 27 percent so far this year, easily outperforming a 12 percent rise in the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index  .SPX . The Chicago-based company is staging a dramatic comeback after being beaten by Airbus for the past five years. This year, it is dominating the lucrative market for wide-body planes with its well-established long-range 777, redesigned 747 jumbo freighter and its new, medium-sized carbon and titanium 787 Dreamliner. Airbus, which is majority-owned by aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ), is struggling with an array of design and production problems on its commercial jets. It has delayed deliveries of its A380 superjumbo by two years, and has not yet pinned down a final design for the mid-sized A350, its competitor to Boeing\\'s 787. Under the leadership of new Chief Executive James McNerney, Boeing has also settled long-running U.S. government probes into its defense contracting practices. In the last two months Boeing\\'s resurgent defense unit has racked up more than $17 billion in orders for U.S. Air Force helicopters and border protection equipment. KOREAN AIR EXPANDS Korean Air, the world\\'s biggest air cargo carrier last year, said in a statement it agreed to buy 15 passenger aircraft and 10 freighters from Boeing to meet growing travel demand and replace its older planes. The world\\'s passenger and cargo market will grow 5 percent to 6 percent each year in the next two decades, accelerated by China\\'s liberalization of its aviation market, South Korea\\'s top airline said. Korean Air, with a fleet of 118 aircraft, aims to become one of the world\\'s top 10 passenger carriers by 2010. Its shares fell 1.9 percent to 35,450 won in Seoul. The carrier ordered 10 777-300ERs and five 737-900/700 single-aisle passenger planes, along with five 747-8 and five 777-200 freighters. Korean Air has options for eight additional aircraft, including four 777-300ERs, two 747-8Fs and two 737-900ER planes. The order, will \"enhance the carrier\\'s operation efficiency through modernization of the fleet and reduction in fuel and operational costs,\" Korean Air said. The aircraft will be delivered between 2009 and 2019, Korean Air said. Engine contracts will be agreed later, it said. Korean Air also has a contract to buy five A380 jets from Airbus for delivery starting in late 2007 through 2009, but the start date has been pushed back to 2010, Korean Air officials said.',\n",

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O, the world\\'s second-largest personal computer maker, reported on Tuesday quarterly earnings that comfortably beat analysts\\' estimates, sending its stock up nearly 10 percent. \\n\\n The company sold more laptop computers, enjoyed strong growth in Asia and Europe, and said efforts to improve profitability were \"starting to take hold.\" Dell provided no year-ago comparisons because of investigations into its accounting that it said may require restatements of prior periods. \"They\\'re making progress,\" said Shaw Wu, an analyst at American Technology Research who has a \"neutral\" rating on the stock. \"It looks like they hit a low\" in the second quarter. Net income for its third quarter ended November 3 was $677 million, or 30 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had forecast net income of 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue was $14.38 billion, shy of analysts\\' average forecast of $14.5 billion as compiled by Reuters Estimates but within an estimate range of $13.97 billion to $14.87 billion. Third-quarter revenue growth, against reported revenue of $13.9 billion a year ago, was the slowest in more than four years as it faced tough competition from Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ), which last week reported a quadrupling of quarterly profit as sales and margins improved. But Dell shares have rallied in recent weeks amid optimism that third-quarter earnings would exceed expectations. Shares of Dell gained 9.5 percent, or $2.35, to $27.17 in extended-hours trade following the report, adding to a 17-cent gain in regular trading on Nasdaq to close at $24.82. The company had delayed the earnings report from November 16 amid the accounting investigations. Dell said on Tuesday its third-quarter results were preliminary and it did not expect to file them on time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Dell has been under pressure as the SEC steps up its accounting probe. It is also dealing with a recall of Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) battery cells in its laptops and complaints of poor after-sales service, while losing its status as the world\\'s top PC maker to Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) last quarter. Dell shares, down 18 percent this year as of Monday, had been trading at about 20 times forward earnings per share, a discount to a computer hardware sector average of 37. HP\\'s stock is up 40 percent in 2006. Revenue growth at Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, hit 22 percent in 2002 and hovered between the mid- and high-teens through the middle of 2005 as it sold computers for less than competitors by selling them directly to customers through its Web site or toll-free phone service.',\n",
       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Almost a third of Americans plan to spend less on the holidays this year, mainly because they need to use their money for daily expenses, according to a survey released on Tuesday. \\n\\n The Consumer Federation of America and the Credit Union National Association found 32 percent of shoppers want to spend less than they did during the 2005 holidays. About half of the survey\\'s roughly 1,000 respondents said they would like to spend about the same. Only 15 percent intended to spend more. Rising energy costs are forcing many to deck the halls more sparsely this year, the report found, but general household expenses and tight family finances are also dragging down holiday budgets. More than 25 percent in the survey said the prices of gifts were simply too high. But shoppers do not always follow through on their spending plans, said CUNA\\'s chief economist Bill Hampel. \"Our experience with this survey is consumers tend to say they will spend less than they actually do, and our overall survey findings are slightly weaker than last year,\" he said in a statement. \"This suggests many households will feel financially \\'hung over\\' in a couple of months unless they do something about it now.\" Those trying to cut back on stocking stuffers tend to be young or struggling financially. More than a quarter of respondents with incomes under $25,000 said they want to spend \"much less\" than last year. \"Despite the let-up in gas prices, young and less affluent Americans appear to be under greater financial stress this year than last,\" CFA Executive Director Stephen Brobeck said in a statement. The share of those concerned about covering their credit card debts after the holidays swelled to 33 percent from 25 percent in last year\\'s survey, and more than half of those aged 18 to 24 worry about being yoked by bills. Credit card giant MasterCard Worldwide released a report on Monday that found the average American intends to shell out nearly $700 this winter on festivities such as Christmas, with almost $300 of that sum spent online for gifts. Most people prefer using debit cards over credit to buy gifts, MasterCard found, with three out of four consumers saying debit cards, which withdraw money directly from a bank account, encouraged them to stay within their budget. CFA and CUNA recommended that shoppers compare prices, pay off debts quickly and plan for next year. They also recommended checking on gift cards. Some companies charge fees for looking up gift card balances, or lower the face value of the card if it isn\\'t immediately used, they said.',\n",

The nine-month legal saga has been a key factor in delaying Lone Star\\'s plan to sell KEB to Kookmin, the country\\'s top lender, and may give South Korea\\'s top lender the upper hand, should Lone Star be required to jettison the stake in a hurry. Lone Star\\'s decision is expected to be finalized in the next few days, FT reported, citing Lone Star Chairman John Grayken. \"In light of this investigation being extended again, and the issuance of arrest warrants against Ellis and Mike, we are considering what we should do with Kookmin,\" Grayken was quoted as saying. \"We\\'re talking about terminating.\" A Lone Star spokeswoman in South Korea declined to comment.

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Merger and acquisition activity worldwide surged on Monday with a focus on real estate, mining, media and exchanges sectors as demand by private equity funds and the push for industry consolidation gathered pace. \\n\\n In the U.S., private equity fund Blackstone BG.UL unveiled a real estate deal valued at $20 billion, excluding debt, while mining group Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold ( FCX.N ) agreed to buy copper miner Phelps Dodge Corp PD.N for $25.9 billion. But big deals were also unveiled from Australia to London and the total announced globally from early Friday in Europe to 1200 GMT on Monday is around $88.5 billion (including debt), according to financial research firm Dealogic. The surge is being driven by profitable companies which have large amounts of cash for investment, and by the flood of money into private equity funds that also needs to be put to work. \"If you quantify the boom so far, we haven\\'t seen anything yet,\" said Teun Draaisma, head of European equity strategy at Morgan Stanley. Draaisma calculates that European M&A this year is on track to hit $1.2 trillion, matching the record in 2000, but relative to the size of the overall market, the volume of new deals is still below previous peaks. At the time of the last peak in M&A activity there were a lot of hostile deals and many bidders were offering their own stock instead of cash to finance the deal, he said. \"We haven\\'t seen any of that yet, its been mostly smaller companies, quite friendly deals and mostly in cash.\" Nothing we look at suggests we\\'re seeing a peak in the M&A cycle,\" Draaisma said. Dealogic announced last week the value of global mergers and acquisitions for 2006 had reached a record $3.368 trillion, beating the previous high set in 2000 of $3.332 trillion. Private equity firms accounted for 22 percent of total global M&A volume in the first nine months of the year, hitting a new record of $570.1 billion in deals. INVESTORS FEARS MUTED Few investors can see an immediate end to the trend, at least until one of the recent deals turns sour. \"There\\'s an enormous wall of money that has been raised...and that money needs to be invested. Maybe the music will stop when we get a significant (deal) failure,\" said Ted Scott, director at F&C Asset Management\\'s retail funds arm. \"Increasingly they (deals) are becoming more risky and marginal gains are being made. Some of the valuations are quite toppy, to say the least,\" he added. But amid a benign global macroeconomic environment and low interest rates, which have created a wide spread between the cost of debt and the return on equity, deals to consolidate industries and capture cash flows are expected to dominate. In the mining sector the global consolidation story has been running all year as companies scramble to add reserves and capitalize on record high metal prices. Those that don\\'t succeed could become targets themselves. \"The mining sector stocks have all got so much cash on their balance sheets there is a risk they are getting vulnerable,\" said Chris Tinker, equity strategist at inter-dealer broker  ICAP. The Blackstone bid for U.S. office building owner Equity Office Properties EOP.N sets a benchmark for a takeover by a single private equity fund. The deals values the company at $20 billion, excluding debt, just shy of the $21 billion paid earlier this year for hospital operator HCA Inc ( HCA.N ) but that deal involved three buyout firms. Among other U.S. deals unveiled on Monday, the U.S. stock exchange Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) launched a $5.1 billion deal for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), and Bank of America ( BAC.N ) agreed to buy U.S. Trust Corp, the private banking unit of Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.O, for $3.3 billion.

Sources familiar with the matter said the New York-based exchange has asked for the London Stock Exchange\\'s shareholder register as it scrambles to send out its offer document, possibly as early as this week. And analysts say the LSE is finding itself increasingly cornered, having already rebuffed four takeover approaches from rivals Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ), Euronext ENXT.PA, Australia\\'s Macquarie Bank MBL.AX and a previous attempt by Nasdaq. \"LSE has more limited means to counter this new bid than it had for the past offers,\" Elie Darwish, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas said in research note. \"We see no potential white knights for the LSE. As Nasdaq owns roughly 29 percent of the exchange it would be difficult for a third party to re-enter the race. LSE no longer has significant cash available to convince them not to support bidders.\" The LSE plans to wait until it needs to issue its first defense document under UK takeover battle rules, which is 14 days after Nasdaq launches its offer, before starting its formal defense against the offer, the sources familiar with the matter said. Meanwhile, Michael Spencer, the chief executive of ICAP, the world\\'s biggest inter-dealer broker, said the company had no plans to re-engage in talks with the LSE. ICAP had held discussions over a possible combination earlier this year. \"The LSE has done a very good defensive job, it\\'s played a blinder. But the options for the LSE are narrowing,\" said Spencer. VULNERABLE Daniel Garrod, analyst at Citigroup, said Nasdaq\\'s chances of success this time around were good, given the prospect of increased competition from the European stock markets\\' biggest users, investment banks, some of whom have clubbed together to set up a rival trading platform for European shares. \"This timing is opportune in that many LSE shareholders may be nervous about prospective threats from Project Boat (a plan by banks to report their own trades, taking revenue from the LSE) and Project European Multilateral Trading Facility and are looking for an exit,\" said Garrod. Investment company Scottish Widows, a long-term holder of LSE shares, cashed in on a doubling in value so far this year on Monday, selling 7.07 million shares to Nasdaq at the U.S. market operator\\'s takeover offer price of 1,243 pence a share to give Nasdaq a total stake in the LSE of 28.5 percent. Nasdaq said on Monday 1,243 pence in cash was its final offer although it reserved the right to revise the price if the LSE board recommended it or a rival bid emerged. Dealers and analysts said the LSE board might be tempted to recommend an offer if it was increased to the 1,300 pence a share level and on Tuesday LSE\\'s shares were trading for much of the day up 0.2 percent at around 1,294p.

( DE.N ) said on Tuesday its quarterly profit rose 19 percent on better-than-expected farm equipment sales, boosting hopes that increasing commodity prices would produce stronger sales in 2007 and sparking a surge in its shares. \\n\\n Profit at the world\\'s largest maker of agricultural equipment increased to $277.3 million, or $1.20 a share, in the fourth quarter ended October 31, from $232.8 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected a profit of 94 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. While margins in its construction and forestry business contracted sharply during the quarter, with profits dropping 12 percent even as sales rose, Deere increased profits in its farm equipment business despite softness in sales. The results hinted at a turnaround in the farm sector. Deere as well as rivals Agco Corp. ( AG.N ) and CNH Global NV CNH.N have faced a drop in demand for tractors and combines because of declining farm cash receipts, rising interest rates, high fuel and fertilizer prices, and uncertainty about government subsidies. Looking forward, Deere forecast lower profits and flat sales in 2007 as weakness in the housing market weighs on sales, offsetting any renewed strength in the farming market. But many analysts said Deere was being too cautious in its outlook. Ann Duignan, an analyst at Bear Stearns, said in a note to investors that \"worldwide farm-economic conditions remain quite promising.\" \"Prices for farm commodities have surged in recent weeks and worldwide carry-over stocks for wheat and corn are at 30-year lows in relation to consumption,\" Duignan wrote. David Raso, an analyst at Citigroup, agreed. \"Deere is not yet willing to bake in ... recent strength in farmer fundamentals,\" he wrote in a note to investors. He predicted the company\\'s 2007 forecast, which anticipates a 22 percent drop in net profit, \"will prove too conservative.\" SALES UP 3 PERCENT Quarterly sales rose 3 percent to $5.12 billion, lifted by a 3 percent hike in sales to forestry and construction customers. That offset a 1 percent decline in sales to agricultural customers and the consumer market. Analysts, on average, expected the Moline, Illinois-based company to report sales of $4.63 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. But looking forward, Deere forecast full-year 2007 profit of \"about $1.325 billion,\" down about 22 percent from $1.694 billion in 2006, in part on a slowdown in the construction and forestry business that lifted earnings this year. Deere said it expects equipment market sales to be essentially flat in the coming year, with a 4 percent increase in agricultural equipment sales offsetting a 5 percent drop in construction and forestry sales.

       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - European shares chugged higher on Tuesday, lifted by takeover talk in the utility and financial sectors and a bullish broker note on Danone ( DANO.PA ), but a new rise in the euro against the yen weighed on car exporters. \\n\\n A rebound in oil prices also held back sentiment. Crude prices rose back above $59 a barrel following a weather-related halt in loadings at Alaska\\'s key export terminal and forecasts calling for a drawdown in U.S. fuel stocks ahead of the winter. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares was 0.15 percent higher at 1,469.15 points by 0910 GMT, five points away from a new 5-1/2 year peak. Trading was muted by the looming Thanksgiving Day holidays and a dearth of major and economic data. \"Even though we are just in the black this morning, the move is mixed and lacks real direction despite a raft of earnings news,\" said Angus Campbell, head of sales at Finspreads. Growing expectations the Bank of Japan will only slowly raise interest rates pushed the yen to a near record low against the euro, fuelling worries of dented revenues for euro zone car exporters .SXAP in the world\\'s second biggest economy. But mergers and acquisitions lent impetus. Shares in Scottish Power SPW.L added 1 percent after sources close to the matter told Reuters that Spanish utility Iberdrola ( IBE.MC ) was set to make a 12 billion pound ($22.7 billion) bid for its Glasgow-based rival in cash and shares. The heads of the companies met over the weekend and a deal is expected as soon as this week, the sources said. Elsewhere, French insurer CNP ( CNPP.PA ) confirmed late on Monday that it could be interested in bidding for a stake in MPS Vita, the insurance unit of Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ), pushing shares in the Italian bank 2 percent higher. Earnings reports also help feed market gains. UK property firm British Land ( BLND.L ) posted a 9.3-percent rise in net asset value and said its full-year dividend would rise at least 94 percent after it converts into a low-tax investment trust, sending its shares up 1.3 percent. Experian ( EXPN.L ) gained 1.7 percent as the British credit information firm posted a 16-percent rise in first-half profit, while inter-dealer broker ICAP ( IAP.L ) also pleased with a jump in half-year revenue and confirmation that it was on course to meet full-year forecasts. Elsewhere, government data showing Swiss watch exports rose 15.5 percent year-on-year in October to 1.504 billion Swiss francs ($1.21 billion) boosted Swatch Group ( UHR.VX ) UHRN.VX and Richemont ( CFR.VX ), which produces Cartier watches.',\n",

( 7752.T ) dropped following a media report that the firm was likely to issue 50 billion yen ($424 million) worth of convertible bonds. \\n\\n Ricoh confirmed the issue after the close of trade. Companies sensitive to domestic demand such as NTT Data Corp. ( 9613.T ) dropped amid concerns about the Japanese economy, countering gains in exporters\\' shares, which were buoyed by the euro\\'s rise to a near record high against the yen. Shares of major banks including Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. ( 8309.T ) extended losses after they reported on Monday that earnings from core operations weakened in the six months ended September 30 as competition squeezed their lending margins. \"People had bought up bank shares on expectations that the economy would be out of deflation, but now that their earnings are out, the feeling is that there may be no need to hold so many bank shares after all,\" said Katsuhiko Mori, a senior portfolio manager in Daiwa SB Investments\\' equity management department. Mori said investors are cautious as many companies have left their conservative earnings outlooks unchanged and personal spending remains weak. The Nikkei  .N225  added 8.20 points to 15,734.14, after logging its lowest close since late September on Monday. The broader TOPIX  .TOPX  was down 0.99 point at 1,532.95, its lowest close since July 26. Ricoh fell 4.0 percent to 2,170 yen, becoming the second-largest drag on the Nikkei, after the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported that the firm would issue convertible bonds, raising concerns of share dilution for current holders of the copier giant\\'s stock. After the market closed, another Japanese copier maker Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. ( 4902.T ) said it would issue 70 billion yen worth of euroyen convertible bonds for capital expenditure and bond redemption.  Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities, said the continued slide in small-cap stocks spurred stop-loss selling from investors, hurting overall market sentiment. The Mothers index .MTHR fell 1.4 percent to 1,008.69 to a new three-year low, after plunging 6.2 percent on Monday. He also said foreign players, disappointed at the slump in the Tokyo stock market that contrasts with record-breaking rallies in New York and Asia, have been moving away from Japan. \"They have been shifting money into markets that show better performance,\" Murai said. Trade volume fell sharply from the previous session, with 1.65 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange\\'s first section. That was also below last month\\'s daily average of 1.8 billion shares. Decliners beat advancers by a ratio of nearly two to one. CONCERNS ABOUT ECONOMY, PROFIT GROWTH Susumu Abe, a manager in the information and investment department of Mito Securities Co., said the Nikkei\\'s technical bounce after Monday\\'s 2.27 percent fall lacked momentum as investors were not keen to buy on dips due to caution about the economy and the growth of corporate profits. \"There are no strong incentives for buying, with little support from macroeconomic indicators,\" Abe said. \"Although companies have been reporting better earnings in the first half of this business year, many of them are cautious about revising up their full-year forecast,\" he added. Shinko Research Institute said on Tuesday recurring profits of major Japanese companies were expected to fall 2.9 percent in the second half of the business year to next March, a sharp contraction from 12.5 percent growth in the first half. The figures are based on reports from 1,146 companies listed on the Tokyo Exchange\\'s first section. Japanese government sources said on Sunday Tokyo would downgrade its view on the country\\'s economy for the first time in almost two years in its monthly report for November, mainly because of sluggishness in personal consumption. Japan\\'s second-largest bank, Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ), lost 2.2 percent to 805,000 yen, while sixth-ranked Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. ( 8309.T ) slid 6.0 percent to 1,127 yen. Among the tech stocks that gained on bargain-hunting, Fanuc, a maker of industrial robots, rose 1.4 percent to 10,460 yen, after falling 3.1 percent in the previous session. Exporters were helped by the yen\\'s weakness against the euro. A weaker yen is a positive for companies that make the bulk of their sales abroad, because it boosts profits when earnings from abroad are brought home. The euro was around 151.44 yen EURJPY= at 0745 GMT, in sight of a record high of 151.68 yen hit on electronic trading platform EBS on Monday.',\n",

London Brent crude LCOc1 rose $1.05 to $60.03. Prices got a lift from news that crude loadings at the port of Valdez, Alaska, were delayed. High winds forced operators to suspend loadings at the port on Monday, slowing the 800,000 barrel per day Trans Alaska Pipeline to 25 percent of capacity. Large Alaskan oil fields such as Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk have been forced to reduce output because of the problems. Analysts still expect government data on Wednesday to show that U.S crude stocks rose for the fourth week in a row by 700,000 barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll of industry analysts. But they said distillate stocks, including winter heating oil, are likely to have fallen by 900,000 barrels. <EIA/S> Weather forecaster WSI Corp said on Monday the U.S. Northeast, the world\\'s largest heating oil market, will have a colder than normal winter. \"Seasonal market fundamentals may have had more to do with stabilising prices than promise of output cuts from OPEC,\" said the Centre for Global Energy Studies. Oil prices that tumbled sharply from a mid-July record high of $78.40 a barrel have steadied at around $58-$62 a barrel since early October. OPEC is on alert to make a further round of production cuts at its December 14 meeting if necessary, deepening the 1.2 million barrels per day reduction it pledged to implement from November 1. The head of the International Energy Agency, which advises 26 industrialised countries, said OPEC didn\\'t need to cut its output as prices remained too high. \"I think that prices are still much too high and all in all I don\\'t see a rationale for a cut,\" said Claude Mandil at an energy conference in Brussels. Analysts expect prices this week to remain within the roughly $58-$62 range that has predominated since early October. partly due to the shortened trading week in the United States. \"We will continue to be mired in broad trading ranges for now,\" said Man Financial. \"The holiday-shortened week should keep activity restrained.\" The New York Mercantile Exchange will be closed on Thursday and Friday for Thanksgiving.

U.S. crude oil for January delivery rose $1.37, or 2.3 percent, to settle at $60.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid supply disruptions in Alaska and a rally in gasoline and heating oil futures. The higher oil prices helped energy companies\\' shares, though, driving Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) up 1.3 percent, or 96 cents, to $73.39 on the NYSE. Exxon Mobil gave the biggest lift to the S&P 500 and was among the Dow\\'s major gainers. Investors have been betting that lower gasoline prices would propel consumer spending in the holiday shopping season, which traditionally kicks off on \"Black Friday,\" the day after Thanksgiving. \"The principal factor that\\'s been driving the market is the idea that the decline in the price of oil will more than offset the impact of deteriorating housing,\" Johnson said. \"Every time you see the price of oil rise, it takes the gusto out of the market.\" U.S. financial markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving, and the stock market will close early on Friday.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) said it agreed to buy much larger Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N for $25.9 billion in cash and stock to create the world\\'s largest publicly traded copper company. \\n\\n The agreement is the latest multi-billion dollar takeover deal in the global mining industry, which has been consolidating as companies scramble to add reserves and try to capitalize on record high metal prices. Copper now trades at $6,765, down from a record of $8,800 in May but up 53 percent on the year. \"This kind of big merger could raise the company\\'s ability to take advantage in price negotiations, therefore this should be positive for copper prices,\" said Naohiro Niimura, director at Barclays Capital Japan Ltd. \"In the current bearish trend, the market is not too sensitive about buying copper actively, but in the medium- and long-term it should be positive.\" Freeport-McMoRan will pay a total of $126.46 per Phelps Dodge share, a premium of 33 percent to Phelps Dodge\\'s November 17 closing price. Phelps Dodge share holders will receive $88 per share and 0.67 of a common share of Freeport-McMoRan. In all, Freeport is paying $18 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in shares. The takeover price values Phelps Dodge at around 8 times forecast 2006 earnings, compared with forward price earnings ratios of 8 for Freeport and 9 for diversified miners BHP Billiton Ltd. BPH.L and Rio Tinto Plc ( RIO.L ). Freeport-McMoRan operates the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, which it said is the world\\'s largest copper and gold mine in terms of reserves. Phelps Dodge has mines in North and South America and Africa. The combined company would produce a net 3.1 billion pounds of copper and a net 1.7 million ounces of gold this year. Combined reserves would total 75 billion pounds of copper and 41 million ounces of gold. \"This acquisition is financially compelling for FCX shareholders, who will benefit from significant cash-flow accretion, lower cost of capital, and improved geographic and asset diversification,\" Freeport-McMoRan Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in a statement. Freeport-McMoRan has received financing commitments from JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) and Merrill Lynch MER.N to finance the deal\\'s $18 billion cash portion. Its debt would stand at $17.6 billion after the transaction. The company said it would issue 137 million shares to Phelps Dodge shareholders, resulting in Phelps Dodge stockholders owning 38 percent of the combined company. MINING MERGERS Phelps had been rumored to be a takeover target of Grupo Mexico, while Phelps itself had been trying to buy two Canadian companies, Inco Ltd. N.TO and Falconbridge Ltd. in a stock and cash deal worth $40 billion. But Phelps lost the nickel and copper producers to all-cash offers from Brazil\\'s Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) ( VALE5.SA ) and Swiss-based Xstrata Plc. Inco is now controlled by CVRD and Falconbridge has been taken over by Xstrata XTA.L. The boards of Freeport-McMoRan and Phelps Dodge have both unanimously approved the terms of the agreement and have recommended that their shareholders approve the transaction. The deal is subject to approval of both firms\\' shareholders and regulators. The transaction is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of 2007. For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2006, the companies had combined revenues of $16.6 billion. For the entire year of 2006, the two companies are expected to generate estimated combined operating cash flows totaling $6.5 billion. Freeport\\'s Adkerson will be the chief executive of the combined company, while Freeport Chairman James Moffett will continue in that role. J. Steven Whisler, Phelps Dodge chairman and CEO, is expected to retire after 30 years at the company. Freeport-McMoRan is being advised by JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch, while Phelps Dodge is being advised by Citigroup ( C.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). Phelps has been under pressure from shareholders, including activist stockholder Atticus Capital, which owns nearly 10 percent of the company and had been seeking a buyer for Phelps. Atticus began agitating for change early in 2006 and helped derail the company\\'s plans to buy Inco and Falconbridge, calling on it instead to buy back shares or consider selling itself.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N surged almost 27 percent on Monday after competitor Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) agreed to buy the company for $25.9 billion. \\n\\n Freeport\\'s proposed cash and stock deal for its larger rival would create the world\\'s largest publicly traded copper company. It is the latest multibillion dollar takeover deal in the global mining industry, which has been consolidating as companies scramble to add reserves and try to capitalize on record high metal prices. \"We had been working on this deal for some time and it has had a good reception from investors,\" Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson told Reuters. Indeed, Phelps Dodge shares jumped 26.8 percent to close up $25.45 at $120.47 on the New York Stock Exchange. Freeport shares fell $1.77, or 3.1 percent, to $55.63. The deal is a long-term bet on copper prices for Freeport. The combined company will reap about 74 percent of its revenue from its copper business, up from about 68 percent for Freeport on a stand-alone basis. But copper prices have dropped nearly 27 percent in recent months after rallying to an all-time record of $4.16 a pound in early May. Still, COMEX copper prices were trading at around $3.06 a pound on Monday -- up almost 42 percent on the year. Adkerson said New Orleans-based Freeport feels \"very positive\" about the additional exposure, noting that copper inventories are low on a historical basis and that industrialization in China should boost demand for the metal. \"We feel this is a good time in our industry situation to give our shareholders that copper exposure,\" he said, speaking on a conference call with analysts. \"We believe this company ... will be able to deal with potentially lower prices if that occurs, but this exposure to this positive marketplace with such strong fundamental supply and demand factors is something we\\'re very excited about.\" Gold will account for about 10 percent of the combined company\\'s revenue, down from about 32 percent of Freeport\\'s business last year. The remaining revenue will come from Phelps Dodge\\'s molybdenum business. A.G. Edwards futures analyst Dan Vaught said the merger\\'s long-term effect on copper prices is still up in the air. \"Forthcoming production looks like it is going to increase rather significantly, but whether or not that translates into enough of an expansion to meet what we assume is going to be strong demand in the future is an open question,\" Vaught said. GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY The deal would give Freeport some geographic diversity. Aside from a copper smelter and refinery in Spain, Freeport\\'s business is based in Indonesia, mostly at its huge Grasberg mine in Papua. Phelps Dodge owns 14 mines and does business on 5 continents. \"Combining the two companies makes sense, especially if Freeport can get a better multiple on its earnings because it no longer is all Indonesia,\" said analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research/Soleil. \"Plus, it doesn\\'t look to me like they are paying very much for Phelps Dodge.\" The Freeport operation has been a frequent source of controversy in Indonesia, with issues ranging from its impact on the environment and the share of revenue going to native Papuans and the Papua government to the legality of payments to Indonesian security forces who help guard the site. In October 2003, eight workers died in a landslide at the Grasberg mine. Some protesters have demanded closure of the lucrative mine, believed to have the world\\'s third-largest copper reserves and one of the biggest gold deposits. Freeport-McMoRan will pay a total of $126.46 per Phelps Dodge share, a premium of 33 percent to Friday\\'s closing price. Phelps Dodge shareholders will receive $88 per share and 0.67 of a common share of Freeport-McMoRan. The combined company will retain the Freeport-McMoRan name. Earlier this year, Phelps failed in a bid to buy two Canadian companies, Inco Ltd. N.TO and Falconbridge Ltd. in a stock and cash deal worth $40 billion. Phelps\\' lost out to all cash bids for those companies. Freeport has offered mostly cash for Phelps.

Now it is also trimming prices on hundreds of fresh and dry grocery items. The retailer is eager to attract more shoppers this holiday season after back-to-back months of disappointing sales growth in September and October. Wal-Mart has said it expects the markdowns to help improve sales growth. Holiday discounts could be coming in other parts of its stores, but Wal-Mart declined to give details. Wal-Mart said that the price of many food items would be lowered by as much as 20 percent. Some items were discounted more heavily. \"While the company remains highly promotional and competitive, we believe that its \\'bark\\' is worse than its \\'bite\\',\" Citigroup analyst Deborah Weinswig wrote in a recent research note.

However, we believe that this misconception has been driven by improved (and earlier) communications/marketing by the company,\" Weinswig wrote. Wal-Mart declared an early start to the holiday season by cutting pricing on more than 100 toys and games on October 18.

The court also upheld an earlier ruling by a judge to bar \\nstate-controlled GDF from taking any decision on the merger \\nuntil its European works council had given its own opinion on \\nthe deal.  GDF and Suez said they would continue to work on the \\nmerger, which would require the French government to privatize \\nGDF. The government currently holds 80 percent of GDF.  \"We note the decision by the Court of Appeal and we confirm \\nthe industrial logic of the proposed merger for both our \\ncompanies,\" GDF Chairman and Chief Executive Jean-Francois \\nCirelli and Suez counterpart Gerard Mestrallet said in a joint \\nstatement.  \"The merger project between Gaz de France and Suez remains \\nthe most pertinent for the future of our companies.

France announced the GDF/Suez merger earlier in the year as \\npart of its strategy of \"economic patriotism,\" and the tie-up \\nwas widely seen as a defensive move by the government to thwart \\nany takeover bid on Suez by Italian utility Enel ( ENEI.MI ).  Italy accused France of economic protectionism over the \\ndeal.  The ruling right-wing government has consistently defended \\nthe merger, saying France needs a national energy champion to \\nnegotiate advantageous contracts on international markets and \\nensure a secure supply of gas and electricity for the country.  But the merger has run into fierce opposition at home in \\nFrance. Trade unions say privatizing GDF will push up gas \\nprices and threaten jobs.  The opposition Socialist party has also threatened to \\nrenationalize GDF if it returns to power.  There has also been discontent among the financial \\ncommunity, with some leading Suez shareholders asking for \\nbetter terms in the merger.  The merger is currently based on a one-for-one share swap \\nwith a one euro per share payout to Suez shareholders.

       "  '  (Adds reaction from plaintiff lawyer) \\n\\n NEW YORK  Nov 22 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday\\ndenied a motion for class-action status for personal injury and\\nwrongful death cases involving Merck & Co.\\'s ( MRK.N ) withdrawn\\nVioxx painkiller.  Judge Eldon Fallon of New Orleans, who is overseeing all of\\nthe more than 7,000 federal lawsuits involving Vioxx, denied a\\nrequest by plaintiffs\\' attorneys for the class-action status.  Class-action status would have given the Vioxx plaintiffs\\nmore leverage in their fight against Merck, by allowing\\nattorneys to sue on behalf of all individuals alleging harm.  \"In this case, the difficulties in class management\\noverwhelm any efficiencies that could be secured through\\nclasswide adjudication,\" Fallon wrote in his decision.  \"Indeed, the predominance of individual issues relating to\\nplaintiffs\\' claims for compensatory and punitive damages\\ndetracts from the superiority of the class action device in\\nresolving these claims.\"  About 24,000 federal and state lawsuits have been filed by\\npeople who claim to have been harmed by the drug, which Merck\\nwithdrew in 2004 after it was shown to increase the risk of\\nheart attacks.  Merck has vowed to fight the lawsuits one by one rather\\nthan agree to a costly group settlement with the plaintiffs --\\nsuch as the one struck by Wyeth WYE.N over its withdrawn\\n\"fen-phen\" diet drugs.  \"We are pleased by today\\'s order because it reaffirms our\\nview that every case is different and should be tried\\nindividually,\" said Ted Mayer, a lawyer for Hughes, Hubbard &\\nReed, Merck\\'s outside counsel.  Merck\\'s shares rose 0.4 percent on Wednesday.  \"Everybody foresaw this court decision; it\\'s not\\nground-breaking news,\" said Michael Galpern, a Vioxx plaintiff\\nlawyer from the Locks law firm in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.  He said courts have historically denied class-action status\\nfor personal-injury lawsuits because of \"the varying\\ndistinguishing characteristics\" of individual plaintiffs.  Of 11 Vioxx lawsuits that have gone to jury verdicts, Merck\\nhas won seven. However, a New Jersey state court judge ordered\\none of the victories to be retried after ruling that some new\\nevidence had come to light.  Some industry analysts have speculated Merck\\'s eventual\\nliability over Vioxx will exceed $5 billion. To date, the\\ncompany has taken combined charges of about $1.28 billion to\\ncover litigation expenses but has not yet paid any damages to\\nplaintiffs.  Plaintiff attorneys last December asked Fallon to certify a\\nnationwide class action.

       "  ' MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australia\\'s Qantas Airways ( QAN.AX ) has received a buyout offer from investment firms Macquarie Bank MBL.AX and Texas Pacific Group that could be worth more than A$10 billion ($7.77 billion), sending its shares up 15 percent. \\n\\n \"The approach is confidential and incomplete and is being investigated by Qantas,\" the airline said in a statement, after a newspaper reported that a Macquarie-led buyout possibly worth A$10.3 billion was in the works. A deal, which could rival US Airways Group Inc.\\'s ( LCC.N ) $8 billion bid for Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK, would mark a change in strategy by private equity groups that had been hunting for cash-rich retail and media assets in Australia. However, private equity firm Texas Pacific TPG.UL has always chased airlines. Its first deal was the rescue of Continental Airlines in 1993. It has held stakes in the former America West and Ireland\\'s Ryanair Plc. ( RYA.I ) and has previously bid for stakes in Air Canada ( ACa.TO ) and South African Airways SAA.UL. Investment bank Macquarie, for its part, has chased everything from top Australian ports group Patrick to the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) over the past year. A Qantas spokesman could add nothing further to its statement and Macquarie declined to comment. Qantas shares soared to a record A$5.25, and closed up 15 percent at A$5.00, valuing the group at A$9.9 billion. \"This has come as a complete surprise as it is not the usual candidate for private equity,\" said James Holt, a portfolio manager with Zurich Financial Services, which holds about A$10 million worth of Qantas shares. Holt said he would have sold Qantas if it had been trading at this price before but was now holding on. \"Given that it\\'s in play now, you will have to keep your options open.\" Two analysts said the market was speculating on a bid at A$5.50 a share, which would value Qantas at A$10.9 billion. That would equate to 18.5 times forecast earnings for 2007, ahead of its two bigger Asian rivals by market value, Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ), at 12.4, and Cathay Pacific Airways ( 0293.HK ) at 17.5. JP Morgan analyst Matt Crowe said Qantas directors would probably want more than A$5.50 a share. \"It\\'s going to be very difficult to get over the line,\" he said. Ratings agency Standard & Poor\\'s placed Qantas\\' BBB+ credit rating on negative creditwatch on expectations that any buyout could be heavily debt financed and weaken its credit quality. OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS The deal would involve Macquarie and associates taking a 25 percent stake in Qantas, other Australian investors taking 25 percent, Qantas senior management 1 percent and international players led by Texas Pacific, taking the rest, the Australian Financial Review newspaper said, citing market sources. That mix would allow the consortium to get around ownership restrictions that limit one individual entity to no more than 25 percent of the airline, and international interests collectively owning no more that 49 percent. \"There is no view to changing any of those caps,\" Australian Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile told reporters. To protect landing rights at airports around the world, Qantas must remain majority-owned by Australians, as take-off and landing rights are negotiated between countries. Final approval of any foreign investment in Australian assets would rest with Australia\\'s Treasurer, Peter Costello, based on national interests. \"On the commercial side, it is for the board of Qantas and the shareholders of Qantas as to what they do,\" Vaile said. Macquarie, which recently led a $9 billion purchase of UK utility Thames Water and made a $1.4 billion bid for a German water metering firm, typically looks for assets that generate steady earnings. \"Being a cyclical business, the multiples won\\'t be as high as they are prepared for pay for supermarkets and things like that,\" said Zurich\\'s Holt. Fort Worth-based Texas Pacific and its affiliate Newbridge Capital bought department store chain Myer for A$1.4 billion in March, while Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL led a failed A$18.2 billion attempt to buy retailer Coles Myer Ltd.  CML.AX. JP Morgan\\'s Crowe said Qantas might make a good candidate for private equity as it has a stable domestic business fuelling half its earnings, with only one rival, Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd VBA.AX. Based on what the newspaper reported, analysts said Macquarie might sell Qantas planes to Macquarie\\'s aircraft leasing business and put Qantas\\'s terminal assets into Macquarie Airports MAP.AX.

An airline spokesman said the transition caused minor delays and the disruption has ended. The Wednesday before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday is one of the busiest travel days of the year.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are pulling out of their financial tailspin but most are not paying close enough attention to customer service, especially when it comes to providing useful information on delays and cancellations, a government watchdog reported on Wednesday. \\n\\n Additionally, the Transportation Department is doing a better job of overseeing consumer protection issues, including civil rights complaints. But the agency almost always forgives fines or other penalties if the airline agrees to correct the problem, and there is little or no follow-up, the agency\\'s inspector general, Calvin Scovel III, said in his report. The Transportation Department in response acknowledged room for improvement and said it will use a new electronic system to monitor its enforcement cases. It also said it was \"developing rules to ensure consumers are properly compensated if they are unfairly denied boarding.\" The update on consumer protection and the industry\\'s 2001 pledge -- at the insistence of Congress -- to improve customer service comes as an estimated 22 million people board flights this week and next for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Scovel\\'s findings showed a sharp drop since the 2001 hijack attacks in the number of airlines that adequately maintain quality assurance programs for customer service. Most complaints involve flight delays or cancellations, the report said. There were 2.2 million flights that were delayed or canceled in 2005, the latest figures show. Airlines are supposed to provide helpful flight information but the report found that gate agents for 13 of 15 airlines at 17 airports did not make timely announcements more than 40 percent of the time. One instance involved a Dallas-to-Philadelphia flight that was running 2-1/2 hours late. \"No announcements were made regarding the delay and no reason was provided,\" Scovel said. Scovel also said access to airline on-time performance data for all flights remains difficult to get via the Internet. Only five of 16 carriers that were reviewed made that information available on their Web sites, prompting Scovel to recommend a tougher government response. \"The (DOT) should revisit its current position on chronic delays and cancellations and take enforcement action against air carriers that consistently advertise flight schedules that are unrealistic, regardless of the reason,\" Scovel said. The report also found that airline information on frequent-flier benefits is of marginal value. Redemption information can be hard to find and is not broadly comparable. \"As a result, it is difficult if not impossible for consumers to compare frequent-flier programs in a meaningful way,\" Scovel said. The Air Transport Association, the trade group for the biggest airlines and most of those evaluated over the past year, said carriers are committed to good service. \"While the report notes a few areas for improvement, the airlines have worked diligently to reduce the rate of annual complaints 70 percent since 2000,\" James May, the group\\'s president, said. But Scovel noted complaints going up again as overall traffic rebounds after hitting a low in 2003. After delays, the top complaint involves mishandled baggage, the rate of which shot up in August and September when homeland security officials imposed new restrictions on carry-on luggage.',\n",
       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian\\'s Tracinda Corp. investment firm said on Wednesday it had sold $462 million of stock in General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), cutting its stake in the automaker to 7.4 percent from 9.9 percent. \\n\\n The news sent GM stock plummeting by almost 5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange -- the largest one-day drop since October 6 when the automaker rejected an alliance with Renault-Nissan. News of Kerkorian\\'s sale of GM shares came on the same day he announced a tender offer for $825 million of stock in MGM Mirage Inc. ( MGM.N ) that would raise his stake to almost 62 percent of the hotel and casino operator. Kerkorian\\'s dual moves touched off speculation that the billionaire investor, who has a history of trading corporate assets in Las Vegas, Hollywood and Detroit, could be steering away from a protracted fight for control of GM\\'s board. \"It signals that he pretty much is going to go quietly into the night,\" said Kevin Reale, an automotive analyst at AMR Research. In a U.S. regulatory filing, Tracinda said it had agreed on Monday to sell 14 million GM common shares in a private transaction for $33 per share. The sale turned a profit for Kerkorian, who paid an average of just over $30 for the GM shares he held, but the ensuing sell-off threatened to push his remaining GM stake of over $1.25 billion into a loss. A Tracinda spokeswoman said the investment company had no further comment. GM said it would not speculate on what Kerkorian\\'s sale implied. \"GM\\'s practice is not to comment on the actions of its shareholders,\" said GM spokeswoman Renee Rashid-Merem. Kerkorian\\'s associate Jerry York resigned from GM\\'s board on October 6 in a dispute over board oversight and strategy triggered by GM\\'s decision not to pursue the alliance with Renault-Nissan he had attempted to broker on Kerkorian\\'s behalf. York\\'s resignation from GM\\'s board -- and his public criticism of the oversight it provided -- led many analysts to believe that Kerkorian could be gearing up for a proxy fight to seek control of GM\\'s board and oust Chief Executive Rick Wagoner. But this week\\'s stock sale cast doubt on the view that Kerkorian was readying for a fight with GM. \"Maybe he doesn\\'t think there will be a blip in Rick Wagoner\\'s plan -- showing he can\\'t create the controversy he needs to change the board\\'s direction,\" Reale said. Other analysts said Kerkorian had retained a sizable enough stake in GM to wield influence and could still buy back the shares he had sold. \"The tea leaves are a little harder to read on this one,\" said Pat McGurn, special counsel at proxy advisory service ISS. \"If (Kerkorian) had sold off his entire position that would have put an end to it once and for all.\" Global Insight automotive analyst George Magliano agreed that Kerkorian\\'s actions would keep investors guessing about his intentions. \"I wouldn\\'t want to be the one who says he\\'s done with GM and he\\'s going to back off, because his history is that he doesn\\'t back off,\" he said. Kerkorian first began amassing what became a $1.7-billion stake in GM in April 2005. Tracinda sold shares once in that period. In December, Kerkorian sold 12 million shares for $252 million to show a loss for tax purposes and then bought back the same number in January for $263 million. Kerkorian remains GM\\'s largest individual shareholder, but now ranks as the fourth largest overall behind three institutional investors led by State Street Global Advisors. Tracinda had been the second largest investor in GM before this week\\'s sale. RENAULT-NISSAN TRIGGERED BREAK Kerkorian had been the catalyst behind the proposed tie-up between France\\'s Renault SA ( RENA.PA ) and Japan\\'s Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ), which he and York had seen as a way to accelerate GM\\'s turnaround efforts. Both Renault and Nissan are headed by Carlos Ghosn, and analysts had seen Kerkorian\\'s proposed deal as a way to bring in an executive highly regarded for his turnaround success at Nissan. But GM\\'s board, including York, voted unanimously to break off talks with Renault-Nissan in early October. Kerkorian, 89, responded by withdrawing plans to buy 12 million more shares in GM, something he had said he might do when the potential alliance was still on the table. GM shares closed down 4.7 percent, or $1.53, to $31.09 in heavy volume. Despite an 11-percent sell-off this week, GM shares are still up 60 percent since the start of the year. GM saw its global sales drop by 2.5 percent over the first nine months of the year as it lost market share to Japan\\'s Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ). The automaker faces tough contract talks next year with its major union. After slashing costs, analysts have also said GM must now show progress with its plan to increase revenue on the strength of new vehicle offerings.

       "  ' SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O comfortably beat analysts\\' estimates for quarterly earnings on Tuesday as it sold more laptops and increased sales in China and Europe, sending its shares nearly 10 percent higher. \\n\\n The world\\'s second-largest personal computer maker said net income for its third quarter ended November 3 was $677 million, or 30 cents per share, compared with the average analyst forecast of 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. \"They\\'re making progress,\" said Shaw Wu, an analyst at American Technology Research who has a \"neutral\" rating on the stock. \"It looks like they hit a low\" in the second quarter. Dell a year ago reported net income of $606 million, or 25 cents per share, but the company said prior-period figures were subject to change because of previously disclosed accounting investigations by auditors, regulators and prosecutors. Third-quarter revenue was $14.38 billion, up 3.4 percent from a reported $13.9 billion a year ago. It was the slowest growth in more than four years, but it fell within the range of Wall Street estimates. Dell sold 17 percent more notebook computers and computer sales in China grew 33 percent, while \"a more balanced approach to pricing\" in Europe helped unit sales there grow 9 percent. \"The improvement in Europe by far contributed the most to the overall improvement,\" said Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who has a \"sector perform\" rating on Dell. \"It looks like the worst is behind the company.\" Revenue growth at Dell hit 22 percent in 2002 and hovered in the mid- to high-teens through the middle of 2005 as it undercut rivals by selling directly through its Web site and toll-free phone service. Sales have been dented in the past year as prices fell and it faced tougher competition from Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ), which last week reported a quadrupling of quarterly profit as sales and margins improved. Dell shares had rallied in recent weeks amid optimism that third-quarter earnings would top forecasts. Dell shares gained 9.5 percent to $27.17 in extended-hours trade following the results. The stock, down 17 percent as of Tuesday\\'s $24.82 close, had traded at about 20 times forward earnings per share, a discount to a computer hardware sector average of 37. HP\\'s stock is up 40 percent in 2006. Dell had delayed third-quarter earnings from November 16 amid the accounting probes. Dell said on Tuesday its results were preliminary and it did not expect to file them on time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It also has not yet filed second-quarter earnings with the SEC. Dell is also dealing with a recall of Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) battery cells in its laptops and complaints of poor after-sales service. It also just lost its status as top PC maker to HP. PROFITABILITY IMPROVES Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, reported third-quarter operating profit margin of 5.7 percent, up from the second quarter\\'s 4.3 percent but still short of margins of 8 percent to 9 percent in early 2005. Dell said it was making progress in its long-term efforts to improve the balance between liquidity, profitability and growth. But it cautioned that in the short term, \"improvement in growth and profitability may not be linear\" as it spends more on customer service, global expansion and new products. Dell forecast a \"muted seasonal uplift\" due to product mix changes and regional profit and said last year\\'s fourth quarter had an extra week, boosting sales against the current quarter. Customer complaints of poor after-sales service prompted Dell to spend more than $150 million this year to open new service call centers and hire more staff to handle queries. Dell\\'s accounting problems, which it has said relate to revenue recognition, accruals, reserves and other matters, is already the subject of investigations by company auditors. Recently the SEC elevated the status of its investigation to formal from informal, giving it authority to issue subpoenas. The U.S. Justice Department has subpoenaed documents related to Dell\\'s financial reports from 2002 to the present. Dell\\'s missteps have led some analysts to question whether Chief Executive Kevin Rollins\\' job may be in jeopardy.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected a final November reading of 93.1. \"Though these figures did little to change the overall outlook, they took the luster off the outlook as we enter the Thanksgiving Day holiday, and the start of the U.S. holiday shopping season on Friday,\" said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. Many Americans do not plan to spend lavishly during the holidays, despite a  healthy job market and income gains this year as higher energy costs and tight finances still leave many families feeling stretched, surveys have found. According to a survey by the Consumer Federation of America and the Credit Union National Association, 32 percent of shoppers want to spend less than they did during the 2005 holidays. About half of the survey\\'s roughly 1,000 respondents said they would like to spend about the same and only 15 percent intended to spend more. The National Retail Federation expects U.S. shoppers to spend just 5 percent more this holiday season, down from 6.1 percent growth a last year. Credit card group Visa USA estimates growth will be around 7.5 percent. For many retailers, how the year-end shopping season pans out means the difference between a good year and a bad year. It also affects the overall U.S. economy, which is largely driven by consumption. The dollar extended losses after the weaker-than-expected reading on sentiment, while U.S. Treasury debt prices were mostly steady in thin trade ahead of the Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday. Stock markets also were little changed. JOBLESS CLAIMS RISE Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the number of U.S. workers applying for jobless benefits rose by an unexpectedly steep 12,000 in the week ending November 18. Overall, jobless claims rose to 321,000 in the week, which compares with Wall Street forecasts for claims of 310,000. This follows a revised 309,000 the previous week. \"So far, jobless claims remain extraordinarily low despite a rapidly deteriorating housing market and a weakening manufacturing sector,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\\'s Economy.com in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The labor market is under close scrutiny after a surprise drop in the unemployment rate to 4.4 percent in October, from 4.6 percent, after 92,000 fresh jobs were created that month. Federal Reserve officials may worry a tight labor market could add to wage pressures as they consider whether to keep interest rates on hold at their next meeting, on December 12. In other data released on Wednesday, U.S. mortgage applications fell for the first time in three weeks despite a dip in mortgage rates to their lowest level since January. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and purchasing loans, for the week ended November 17 fell 3.7 percent to 623.6 from the previous week\\'s 647.5.

This compares with a revised 309,000 the week before, which was initially reported as 308,000 applications for aid. A Labor Department official said there were no special factors accounting for the increase in claims last week. The four-week moving average -- seen as a more reliable gauge of underlying employment trends -- rose to 317,000 compared with 314,000 the week before.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumers were likely less upbeat by the end of November as the slowdown in the housing markets and the uncertainty over the economic outlook took their toll on sentiment. \\n\\n The University of Michigan will release its final reading of the November consumer sentiment index at 10:00 am on Wednesday, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. A Reuters poll of analysts expects to see the index ease slightly to 93.1 from the final October reading of 93.6. A reading of 93.1 would still be the highest since mid-2005. Gasoline prices have fallen from the record highs seen over the course of the summer to their lowest levels in six months and the recent erosion in crude oil prices bodes well for the energy-intensive winter months. However, the sharp slowdown in the pace of homebuilding, coupled with a decline in average house sale prices has brought the resilience of the U.S. economy into question. Consumer spending is starting to fade, especially when vehicle purchases are subtracted from the equation. Weakness in the University of Michigan sentiment index may not translate into weakness in retail sales. Unusually low interest rates of the past few years have weakened the relationship between consumer confidence gauges and spending patterns, and retailers will also benefit with the key holiday shopping season kicking off this week.',\n",
       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) showed a continued slowdown in profit growth and reported weaker-than-expected revenues on Wednesday that caused shares in France\\'s biggest retail bank to fall more than 4 percent. \\n\\n Gross operating profit during the third-quarter rose 19 percent to 1.29 billion euros as revenues rose 15 percent to 3.81 billion euros. Both these figures were below market forecasts. \"The net profit came in ahead of consensus due to a low tax rate and low risk charges, but the operating number came in below our expectations with weak revenues at its asset management arm,\" said West LB analyst Christoph Bossmann. Credit Agricole was the biggest loser on France\\'s benchmark CAC 40 index  .FCHI . The stock was down 4.3 percent at 32.8 euros by 0922 GMT. Credit Agricole said net profit rose 12 percent from a year ago to 1.15 billion euros ($1.47 billion), with earnings partly boosted by its acquisition of full control of Greek bank Emporiki. Fifteen analysts polled by Reuters gave an average net profit forecast of 1.12 billion euros. However, the third-quarter net profit fell from a second-quarter net profit of 1.28 billion euros and a first-quarter net profit of 1.39 billion euros. \"Overall, not an impressive set of results, in our view,\" said broker Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Ltd, which cut its rating on Agricole to \"market perform\" from \"outperform\" and recommended switching out of Agricole into BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ). SLOWDOWN IN SECTOR Earlier this month, rival French banks BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) and Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) reported a 25 percent and 12 percent rise in third-quarter net profit respectively but also showed a fall in profit from previous quarters this year. The investment banking divisions of leading European banks had a drop in trading volumes during the third-quarter as investors stayed away during the summer holiday season. Rising interest rates also hurt retail banks, such as Credit Agricole. As short-term rates have risen, long-term rates have remained low, flattening the gap between the two known as the yield curve. The flattened yield curve squeezes banks\\' net interest margin, which is the difference between what banks pay to borrow money and what they charge to lend it. Last month, Credit Agricole struck a $7.5 billion deal to buy more than 650 Italian bank branches, and the French bank remained upbeat over its prospects. \"Credit Agricole\\'s excellent performance since the start of the year, in parallel with the rapid implementation of the business development plan, confirms the group\\'s strong growth potential,\" Chairman Rene Carron said in a statement. Chief Financial Officer Gilles de Margerie declined to comment on press reports that Agricole might bid for Turkey\\'s Oyakbank, but reiterated that the French bank remained interested in the Turkish market. He also said the situation regarding Nextra, Credit Agricole\\'s fund management venture with Italian bank Intesa BIN.MI, remained \"open\". French press reports have said Intesa might buy back Agricole\\'s stake in Nextra. Based on latest prices, Credit Agricole shares have risen around 23 percent since the start of 2006, outperforming an 18 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European bank sector .SX7P. The stock reached a record high of 36.15 euros last month. (additional reporting by Lincoln Feast)',\n",
       "  ' SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. buyout fund Lone Star is close to terminating its $7.3 billion deal to sell Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) to Kookmin Bank 060000.KS because of a prosecutors\\' investigation, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. \\n\\n But shares in both Kookmin and KEB both gained over 1 percent in early trade, as the possible collapse of the transaction was seen as being already discounted in Kookmin shares, which have lost ground in the past five sessions. The sale of KEB to Kookmin, which would be the country\\'s second-biggest takeover, has been seen as a litmus test for foreign investors, amid a backdrop of growing anti-foreigner sentiment. South Korean prosecutors started looking into allegations in February that financial data on KEB 004940.KS had been understated to help Lone Star buy the bank in 2003 at a bargain price of $1.2 billion. Prosecutors are seeking to extradite Lone Star Vice Chairman Ellis Short and general counsel Michael Thomson from the United States for questioning in relation to stock trading in KEB Credit Service, after a South Korean court issued warrants last week to detain the two men. The nine-month legal saga has been a key factor in delaying Lone Star\\'s plan to sell KEB to Kookmin, and may give South Korea\\'s top lender the upper hand, should Lone Star be required to jettison its stake in a hurry. Lone Star\\'s decision is expected to be finalized in the next few days, the FT reported. \"In light of this investigation being extended again, and the issuance of arrest warrants against Ellis and Mike, we are considering what we should do with Kookmin,\" Lone Star Chairman John Grayken was quoted as saying. \"We\\'re talking about terminating.\" A Lone Star spokeswoman in South Korea declined to comment, and a Lone Star spokesman in New York could not be reached immediately. Kookmin shares were up 1.53 percent at 73,000 won by 0026 GMT, and KEB shares were up 1.18 percent at 12,850 won, against the wider market\\'s  .KS11  0.38 percent rise. \"A possible termination of the deal had been around in the market, and now such a risk has increased with his remarks,\" said Mok Young-chung, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. \"Still many people are sticking with the expectations that the deal would stay on track, although the legal issue would make the process very long.\" Should the deal fall through, Lone Star would try to put KEB up for sale again after the legal issues were resolved, and Kookmin may join the auction, analysts said. A Kookmin official in charge of the deal said he was unaware of the talk of termination. Officials at KEB and the Financial Supervisory Commission, the country\\'s top financial watchdog, could not immediately be reached for comment. Chae Dong-wook, who is overseeing the Lone Star investigation at the Supreme Prosecutors\\' Office, said the office was preparing to submit extradition requests. He also said he did not know about a report of the possible collapse of Lone Star-Kookmin talks. Foreign direct investment plans received during the third quarter fell 14.8 percent from a year earlier, according to the commerce ministry. The South Korean government tightened regulations this year to close tax loopholes which critics said allowed foreign investors to make tax-free windfalls in the country.',\n",

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hormel Foods Corp. ( HRL.N ) on Wednesday posted higher quarterly profit, in line with raised expectations it announced earlier this month, and gave a forecast for current-quarter earnings that was higher than analysts\\' estimates. \\n\\n Hormel shares rose more than 3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange and reached an all-time high early in the session. Specialty foods such as ingredients and sugar substitutes, and refrigerated foods like sliced pepperoni, helped the company offset higher costs in its Jennie-O turkey business. Like other meat companies, Hormel has been hit by higher feed costs as grain prices soar. \"The protein industry cannot absorb these higher costs long-term,\" Jeff Ettinger, chief executive, said during a conference call with analysts. He added that the company would raises price \"over time,\" on products affected by the higher costs. Profit rose to $90 million, or 64 cents a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended October 29, from $82.2 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 5 percent to $1.56 billion. Analysts, on average, had looked for 64 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. On November 10, Hormel raised its earnings forecast for the quarter to a range of 63 to 65 cents a share. Hormel forecast first-quarter earnings of 52 to 58 cents a share. Analysts, on average, expect 51 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. For all of 2007, the company sees earnings of $2.15 a share to $2.25 a share, saying it expects its \"value-added initiatives\" to overshadow higher grain costs that will pressure its turkey business. In recent years Hormel, which also makes Spam luncheon meat, has focused on \"value-added\" convenience products, like precooked bacon and heat-and-eat entrees, in order to boost sales and profits. But some analysts were cautious about the company\\'s prospects for 2007, especially noting that Hormel trades at a higher earnings multiple than other meat companies. \"While we appreciate the benefits of the company\\'s diversified and value-added model, we are concerned that higher corn prices in the year ahead will hurt the turkey unit, and that later in (the second half of 2007) higher hog costs (as corn is passed through) may hurt refrigerated meats profitability,\" Pablo Zuanic, analyst at J.P, Morgan Securities, said in a research note. Hormel shares were up $1.14 at $37.83 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange and traded as high as $38.60 earlier. The stock is up more than 15 percent this year, compared with a 11 percent increase for the Standard and Poor\\'s packaged foods index .15GSPFOOD.',\n",

Orkla said the parties planed a subsequent IPO of the joint venture, related to Alcoa\\'s intention to exit the soft alloy extrusion business. The extrusion business of Orkla\\'s subsidiary Sapa Group consists of 18 facilities in 12 countries and approximately 6,000 employees, while Alcoa\\'s soft alloy extrusion business has 22 facilities in eight countries and about 6,400 employees. \"The joint venture will become a global leader in the aluminium extrusion business, with an estimated annual turnover of $4 billion in 2006,\" said Ole Enger, Chairman of Sapa and head of Orkla\\'s Specialty Materials business in the statement.',\n",

( STN.N ) and Wynn Resorts Ltd ( WYNN.O ) all rose, as MGM Mirage stock hit an all-time high. \"The offer implies that the company is presently undervalued by the public markets,\" CIBC World Markets analyst David Katz said in a research note. Tracinda Corp., which already owns 56.3 percent of Las Vegas-based MGM, said it would offer to buy 15 million more shares for $55 each, or a 12 percent premium to the stock\\'s Tuesday close of $49. MGM shares were up 10 percent at $53.90 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after hitting an all-time high of $54.41. Katz said \"other established large-cap companies should trade higher, particularly Boyd, Station, and Wynn, particularly those with large inside holders.\" Shares of Boyd, where insiders own more than half of the company, were up 1.9 percent. Shares of Station Casinos, with insider ownership of about 20 percent, were up 2.8 percent, both on the NYSE. Shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd. ( WYNN.O ), where directors and executives including chairman and CEO Steve Wynn own more than half the company, were up nearly 1 percent on Nasdaq. Shares of Ameristar Casinos Inc. ASCA.O were up 3.5 percent on Nasdaq after rising more than 11 percent on Monday, when the death of majority shareholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Craig Neilsen sparked speculation that the company would be sold. Shares of MGM, the second-largest U.S. casino operator, have been capped for the past year or so by investor concerns over high capital spending, particularly the company\\'s $4.5 billion net cost for the CityCenter project on the Last Vegas Strip. \"If the deal is fully tendered, we think it could be a sign that investors also have some concerns about MGM\\'s development project,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said in a research note. \"However, if the stock holds in at these $53-$54 levels and if significantly less than 100 percent of the float is tendered, it signals that investors are willing to forgo short-term economic profit with the belief that the shares are fundamentally undervalued in the long term.\" Analysts also said Kerkorian\\'s move may have implications for the industry\\'s largest pending deal -- a $15 billion bid from two private equity firms to acquire No. 1 casino operator Harrah\\'s Entertainment Inc. HET.N David Anders, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said rapid appreciation of stocks in the group will be another item for consideration by Harrah\\'s board as it continues to evaluate the early October bid from Texas Pacific and Apollo Management. \"By dragging out the process, the market for casino assets has only gotten stronger, and we believe this new information will likely have to be addressed as the board evaluates the fair value for the company,\" he said in a research note. Shares of Harrah\\'s were up 1.6 percent at $77.13 on the New York Stock Exchange. Katz said that, although Tracinda\\'s strategy is not clear at present, the notion that MGM Mirage could become a private entity at some point also appears more realistic.',\n",

Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. ( 4902.T ) dropped on dilution concerns following its convertible bond issuance plan, while NEC Corp. ( 6701.T ) ended at a four-month closing low after it posted a wider first-half loss and Mizuho Securities cut its rating on the stock.  Some said the market was also aided by hopes that stock tax breaks may not be repealed as previously expected. A government panel had been expected to propose letting preferential tax treatment for capital gains and dividends expire at the end of fiscal year 2007 as initially planned. But the head of the tax panel for Japan\\'s ruling party spoke against ending these measures, and the Nihon Keizai reported in its evening edition that the government had started discussing steps to prevent a rush of stock sales before the scheduled end to the special tax breaks. \"Investors had been disappointed by the news that the government may let the tax treatment expire as planned, so now they may be getting their hopes up,\" said Toshihiko Matsuno, assistant general manager at SMBC Friend Securities. But Matsuno added that investors overall were reluctant to build new positions ahead of the holiday. Takashi Kamiya, chief economist at T & D Asset Management, said the market view on the economy has turned dim but a turnaround was possible depending on Japanese companies\\' sales during the Christmas season. \"The key will be retail sales, especially in the United States,\" he said. \"Piled-up inventories in the Japanese technology sector have been a concern, and investors want to see how they will clear during the Christmas season.\" Volume rose from the previous session with 1.75 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange\\'s first section.

Meanwhile, Konica Minolta dropped 3.4 percent to 1,681 yen on fears of share price dilution after said it would issue 70 billion yen in euroyen convertible bonds to raise cash for capital spending and bond redemption.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil fell on Wednesday after a weekly U.S. government report showed a surprising rise in crude stockpiles heading into peak winter demand. \\n\\n U.S. crude CLc1 settled 93 cents lower at $59.24 a barrel, while London Brent LCOc1 lost 90 cents to settle at $59.49 a barrel. The U.S. government\\'s Energy Information Administration said crude stocks rose last week by 5.1 million barrels, compared with a forecast for a 600,000-barrel increase, putting inventories about 6 percent over last year. The big increase came as imports rebounded sharply following some port disruptions that had delayed shipments earlier in the month. Slow refinery activity also contributed to the inventory build, analysts said. \"It\\'s clearly bearish,\" said Jason Schenker of Wachovia Securities in North Carolina. \"Expectations for crude supplies were not even in the same ball park.\" Gasoline stocks, meanwhile, rose by 1.4 million barrels, compared with expectations for a 900,000 barrel decrease. Distillate inventories, including diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.2 million barrels, in line with a Reuters poll of analysts. Although distillate stocks had fallen, the draw was concentrated in diesel and not in heating oil, which fell by only 100,000 barrels. Heating fuel stocks are still \"highly elevated\" for the start of winter, BNP Paribas said in a written comment. Bulging inventories in consumer nations raised concern in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which decided to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day from November 1. Echoing earlier comment, Kuwait\\'s oil minister said OPEC would cut output again in December if prices deteriorated. He said a $55-$60 price range was satisfactory. Prices have fallen by around 25 percent from a record for U.S. crude of $78.40 in July and have been locked in a range of roughly $58-$62 for more than a month. Oil had rallied by well over a dollar on Tuesday, partly in response to news severe weather at the Alaskan port of Valdez had halted crude oil shipments and forced companies to cut output by nearly two-thirds.  Terminal operators said weather conditions at the Valdez port had improved, allowing one tanker to complete loading its cargo and depart. Foul weather is expected in the area until Thursday. Traders said Tuesday\\'s gains had also been driven by strength in refined products as traders covered positions ahead of Wednesday\\'s government data and the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday and Friday in the United States.

The Dow\\'s biggest boost came from Alcoa, up 4.3 percent, or $1.24, at $30.43 on the New York Stock Exchange. Late on Tuesday, the aluminum producer had announced a restructuring plan and layoffs.  CRAY SOARS, GM FALLS Helping the tech sector was a 17.1 percent surge in shares of Cray Inc. ( CRAY.O ), which gained $1.70 to close at $11.62 on Nasdaq after news that the company won part of a large government contract for a supercomputer project. GM\\'s decline curbed the Dow\\'s advance after Tracinda Corp., Kerkorian\\'s investment firm, said it had cut its stake in the automaker to 7.4 percent from 9.9 percent. That disappointed GM\\'s shareholders, who had hoped Kerkorian\\'s influence would help the automaker. Shares of GM, which were the heaviest weight on the blue-chip Dow, slid 4.7 percent, or $1.53, to close at $31.09 on the New York Stock Exchange. A steep decline in oil futures prices gave investors a reason to unload some shares in the energy sector, driving Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) down 0.7 percent, or 48 cents, to $72.91 on the NYSE. Exxon Mobil was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and among the Dow\\'s biggest losers. U.S. January crude oil futures CLF7 fell 93 cents, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $59.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after government data showed a larger-than-expected rise in domestic inventories last week.  Wall Street\\'s mood also was dampened by data showing weaker-than-expected consumer sentiment just before the beginning of the holiday shopping season.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) on Tuesday announced a restructuring of its product operations that will include plant closings and could ultimately result in a 10 percent reduction of its worldwide work force. \\n\\n About 6,700 jobs will be cut in the next year and a further 6,400 jobs will be moved into a joint venture with Norway\\'s Orkla ASA ( ORK.OL ) with the intent eventually to spin it off, the Pittsburgh-based company said. The restructuring program is expected to save $125 million per year before taxes, said Alcoa, which currently employs 129,000 people globally. Alcoa said it has a letter of intent with Orkla ASA\\'s Sapa Group to form a joint venture to combine its soft alloy extrusion business -- in which aluminum is molded into various shapes for products such as furniture -- with Sapa\\'s extruded aluminum business. The venture will be majority owned by Orkla and operated by Sapa and is expected to be set up by the end of the first quarter next year, subject to approvals. \"There have been questions about the profitability of our downstream (product) operations, in particular soft alloy extrusion,\" spokesman Kevin Lowery told Reuters. \"So we will be exiting that business through a joint venture.\" Alcoa\\'s operations are split between upstream, such as bauxite mining and refining to produce aluminum, and downstream businesses that produce a variety of aluminum products for the aviation and automobile industries, as well as for food cans and kitchen wrap. The joint venture with Orkla will allow Alcoa to focus on better-performing downstream businesses. \"Our overall downstream operations have continued to improve their financial performance the past few years,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alain Belda. He noted that flat-rolled product segments have grown 14 percent annually since 2002 and are in a strong position to capture further growth in China and Russia. Also Alcoa Howmet and Alcoa Fastening Systems have improved profitability by more than 60 percent in the past year, Belda said. Alcoa said it will have restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of between $375 million and $425 million after tax. The company also will recognize an $85 million to $95 million after-tax gain in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter from its sale of its Home Exteriors business on October 31. As part of the review of its overall downstream operations, Alcoa plans a targeted restructuring program to further increase efficiency and profitability. The restructuring will include some plant closings and consolidations that will affect about 6,700 positions during the next year. In the flat rolled products business, the restructuring of can sheet operations will result in the elimination of some 320 positions, including the closure of the Swansea can sheet facility in Wales. Restructuring of the hard alloy extrusion production operations serving the aerospace, automotive and industrial products markets, will result in approximately 370 positions being eliminated in the United States and Europe. In the automotive and light vehicle wire harness and component operations, the manufacturing operations of the AFL Seixal plant in Portugal will close and restructuring of the AFL light vehicle and component operations in the United States and Mexico will affect more than 4,800 positions, Alcoa said. The consolidation of selected operations in global packaging production will eliminate approximately 470 positions, while reduction in the global primary metals and alumina operations will affect about 330 positions. In January 2005, Alcoa said it was exploring streamlining its operations as a result of the company\\'s new global business structure. The plans called for the reduction of about 2,000 positions during the year. (Additional reporting by Leonard Anderson)',\n",

Alcoa announced late on Tuesday it would slash its work force by about 10 percent, or 13,100 jobs, through plant closings and by spinning off one business through a joint venture. The moves are expected to yield cost savings of $125 million per year before taxes, or about 10 cents per share, according to analyst Chuck Bradford of Bradford Research. \"It\\'s a step in the right direction, but it\\'s not a terribly big number,\" he said. The Pittsburgh company\\'s plan to link its soft alloy extrusion business -- in which aluminum is molded into various shapes for products such as furniture - with Norway\\'s Orkla ASA ( ORK.OL ) was also a positive move.

       "  ' SYDNEY/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) jumped 5 percent in U.S. trading on rumors of a takeover bid by BHP Billiton Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ), but analysts gave an offer low odds. \\n\\n A deal for $11 billion Freeport would not be financially attractive enough for BHP, which has a number of big projects of its own under development, and there are also risks associated with Freeport\\'s assets, they said. Freeport\\'s Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia is a world class orebody, but faces operational and environmental problems reminiscent of the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea which BHP finally exited in 2002, they added. \"I\\'d be a little surprised if BHP is queuing up, if only because they had a pretty bad experience with Ok Tedi and they\\'ve got a pretty full list of internal opportunities,\" said Daiwa analyst Mark Pervan. The project might also not meet BHP\\'s acquisition criteria, said ABN AMRO analyst Rob Clifford. \"If they were to buy Freeport at the current price on market copper price expectations, it would be earnings accretive over the next couple of years. But that\\'s not what they look at. They look at long-term value. I suspect it may struggle,\" he said. BHP Billiton was also concentrating on increasing output at the giant Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine in outback Australia, and developing its Ravensthorpe nickel project, said Macquarie analyst John Moorhead. However, they said it was impossible to rule out a takeover in the current climate as global miners scramble to add reserves and try to capitalize on record-high metal prices. The speculation came only two days after Freeport itself agreed to buy much larger Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N for $25.9 billion to create the world\\'s largest publicly traded copper company. Shares in Freeport rose to $58.41 on Tuesday, valuing its offer for Phelps at $127.13 a share. That was up slightly from $126.46 a share when the companies announced the deal. Phelps shares, however, fell 2.4 percent to $117.60, indicating some investors believed it may be left at the altar. Traders said BHP Billiton, with a market capitalization of about $114 billion, was big enough to bid for Freeport-McMoRan, Phelps Dodge, or even both. If it was interested in Grasberg, it would likely bid before any Freeport/Phelps Dodge tie-up as the Phelps Dodge assets were of less interest, added Daiwa\\'s Pervan. BHP Billiton shares rose 2.9 percent to A$26.43 in a firmer overall market on Wednesday, while rival Rio Tinto Ltd ( RIO.AX ) added 2.6 percent to A$74.44 on a bounce in metals prices. \"We don\\'t comment on market rumors and speculation,\" said BHP Billiton spokeswoman Samantha Evans.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - With the official holiday shopping season about to get under way, consumer electronics retailers are rolling out aggressive \"Black Friday\" deals in an effort to win a larger share of flat-panel television sales. \\n\\n High-definition LCD and plasma TVs, with their sleek shapes and quickly declining prices, are expected to be one of the holiday season\\'s hottest selling items. Profits at consumer electronics retailers have surged in the past year as shoppers replace clunky tube TVs that cost hundreds of dollars with advanced ones that can cost thousands. But with more retailers elbowing in on the flat-panel TV market, the promotional environment has intensified heading into \"Black Friday,\" the day after Thanksgiving that kicks off the holiday shopping season. Consumers can expect to be inundated with special offers on a dizzying array of TVs, and investors are waiting to see if they turn to specialty retailers like Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) and Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N to buy their TVs or if they head to discount retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) They are also watching to see how Wal-Mart\\'s announcement that it would implement its \"most aggressive pricing strategy ever\" will factor in to TV sales, and if retailers can offset these overall lower prices with higher volume to keep ringing up strong sales. \"With the sharp price declines that commenced in September and continued through November, the TV category has entered the critical holiday selling period with more uncertainty than anticipated,\" Colin McGranahan, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, wrote in a research note. At the moment, he said, Best Buy appears \"firmly in the driver\\'s seat\" and its \"secret\" specials for Black Friday feature the same Panasonic 42-inch plasma that Wal-Mart discounted in early November. He said Best Buy\\'s price of $999 is a 20 percent reduction from Wal-Mart\\'s $1,249 price. But adding to the mix, Circuit City is advertising a Panasonic 42-inch plasma TV for $1,199.99, while an ad on Wal-Mart\\'s Web site says it will be selling a Viore 42-inch plasma high-definition TV for $988 on Black Friday. In a research note, Goldman Sachs said its latest pricing study suggests annualized price declines for advanced TVs in excess of 30 percent, steeper than the 25 to 30 percent declines suggested by its previous studies. \"Over time, encroachment by discounters is likely to eat into share and margins on new TV technologies, but to date we do not believe Wal-Mart and Target have particularly compelling offering of flat-panel,\" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler in the note. Best Buy and Circuit City, which have a wider selection of TV accessories and services such as home installation, should be able to use that to their advantage to offset lower margins, he wrote. However this upcoming holiday season shapes up, retailers should enjoy the flat-panel TV sales rush while it lasts. \"The cycle has accelerated and compressed to a larger degree than expected, and we are increasingly confident in our view that holiday 2006 will mark the peak growth rate in the category,\" wrote McGranahan in a note.',\n",

According to a survey by the Consumer Federation of America \\nand the Credit Union National Association, 32 percent of \\nshoppers want to spend less than they did during the 2005 \\nholidays. About half of the survey\\'s roughly 1,000 respondents \\nsaid they would like to spend about the same and only 15 \\npercent intended to spend more.  The National Retail Federation expects U.S. shoppers to \\nspend just 5 percent more this holiday season, down from 6.1 \\npercent growth a last year. Credit card group Visa USA \\nestimates growth will be around 7.5 percent.  For many retailers, how the year-end shopping season pans \\nout means the difference between a good year and a bad year.

The labor market is under close scrutiny after a surprise \\ndrop in the unemployment rate to 4.4 percent in October, from \\n4.6 percent, after 92,000 fresh jobs were created that month.  Federal Reserve officials may worry a tight labor market \\ncould add to wage pressures as they consider whether to keep \\ninterest rates on hold at their next meeting, on December 12.

       "  ' BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Credit card company MasterCard drew a \\nrebuke at a closed European Commission antitrust hearing last \\nweek after claiming incorrectly that Britain had dropped an \\ninvestigation into its fees, people who were present said. \\n\\n  MasterCard ( MA.N ) made the statement near the start of the \\ntwo-day hearing on Commission allegations that it sets \\nexcessive charges on shops and others that accept its credit \\nand debit cards, they said.  Merchants pay banks an \"interchange fee\" -- a percentage of \\neach purchase -- to process card-based transactions.  EU countries, shops and representatives of the airline and \\npetroleum industries sharply criticised MasterCard\\'s fees.  The Commission conducted the hearing to let MasterCard \\nreply to allegations that it restricts competition by setting \\nminimum prices retailers must pay. The EU executive is \\nconsidering abolishing the controversial and complex interbank \\nfees charged by MasterCard, which can differ card by card.  Merchants hate the fees.  A representative of Ikea, the Swedish furniture chain, said \\nit could lower costs on many items, even amid high energy \\nprices, but could not negotiate the fees imposed by MasterCard.  Others that use the cards, from British Petroleum ( BP.L ) to \\nthe International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade \\ngroup of airlines, also complained.  Some said a MasterCard rule that they must accept all of \\nthe company\\'s cards made it impossible to control costs. \\nMasterCard imposes different fees on different cards, and \\nmerchants say it can be difficult to learn of the fees for a \\nparticular card.  Several countries -- in particular Britain, Belgium and \\nFinland -- say MasterCard raised rates on debit cards when it \\ntook over their operation.  MasterCard said its fees were reasonable, citing as \\nevidence what it called a decision by Britain to drop an \\ninvestigation of them. But a British official said the probe \\nwas ongoing.  The two sides focused on Australia, whose central bank \\nforced MasterCard and Visa to lower their interchange fees in \\n2003 after the rival card firms lost a court battle.  The central bank this year also set new standards on debit \\ncards, aimed at reducing interchange fees. Two weeks ago, New \\nZealand\\'s competition authority started legal proceedings \\nagainst 11 financial institutions including Visa and \\nMasterCard.  MasterCard said it had been badly hurt by its Australian \\nexperience and the change of structure had cut its income. \\nThose on the other side said the Australian sanctions had \\nworked.  MasterCard called the Commission\\'s complaint obsolete \\nbecause it was made when the company was a non-profit \\norganisation. MasterCard recently went public.  But the Commission said the violations dated to before the \\nchange occurred and that the earlier actions could be producing \\nlong-term effects.  MasterCard, when contacted by Reuters, had no immediate \\ncomment.',\n",

       "  ' BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany does not expect to take a direct \\nstake in aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ) via state bank KfW or \\nother federal or state institutions, a senior government \\nofficial told Reuters on Thursday. \\n\\n  Germany has been thinking about ways to safeguard its \\ninfluence in EADS should core shareholder DaimlerChrysler \\nDCXGn.DE cut its 22.5 percent holding by 7.5 percent as \\nDaimler has said it wants to do.  Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Berlin wants to keep \\nGerman-French parity in the group. Her government is concerned \\nthat a reduction of DaimlerChrysler\\'s stake could diminish \\nGerman influence at a time when Airbus is about to push through \\nsubstantial cost cuts.  Under a model being discussed by the government, \\nDaimlerChrysler would retain its current voting rights. Details \\nof the plan have yet to be fully agreed.  \"Taking a direct stake in EADS via KfW or similar \\ninstitutions is not envisioned,\" the official said, requesting \\nanonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.  One option that has been discussed in German media is that \\nDaimler unit Dasa AG would issue a convertible bond tied to the \\n7.5 percent stake, which could be bought by a consortium of \\ninvestors. This would enable the government as one of the \\ninvestors to buy into EADS while avoiding the appearance of \\ntaking a direct stake.\\n  CONTRADICTION  Without disclosing details, German government spokesman \\nUlrich Wilhelm confirmed on Wednesday that a basic agreement on \\nwhat to do about EADS had been reached several days earlier.  The comments by the unidentified German official on \\nThursday contradicted other comment on Wednesday from a \\nseparate official from the city-state of Hamburg, where the \\nAirbus plane-making unit of EADS has a large plant.  The Hamburg official had said 51 percent of the stake in \\nEADS that Daimler wants to unload would be taken over by a \\ngroup of German states and the federal government, while the \\nother 49 percent would go to a consortium of banks.  Ever since EADS was created in 2000, the company has \\nmaintained a delicate balance between German and French \\ninfluence in its shareholder structure and management.  Delays in the Airbus A380 superjumbo have forced EADS to \\nexamine changes to the way it produces large commercial jets. \\nBerlin fears this could lead to substantial job cuts in \\nGermany.  Separately on Thursday, a source told Reuters that Manfred \\nBischoff, the German co-chairman of EADS, would give up his \\npost at the firm next year if he becomes the chairman of \\nDaimler as expected.  In France, a judicial source said the public prosecutor\\'s \\noffice had begun a preliminary investigation into alleged \\ninsider trading in EADS shares.',\n",
       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - Air France KLM ( AIRF.PA ), under pressure from Rome to commit to a merger with Alitalia, announced exploratory talks with the ailing carrier on Thursday but reaffirmed conditions for a deal. \\n\\n Chief Executive Jean-Cyril Spinetta, unveiling higher second-quarter operating results which contrasted with Alitalia\\'s persistent losses, stressed the talks were at early stages and repeated demands for Alitalia AZPIa.MI to be privatized. But Air France KLM shares fell sharply on the mention of a merger that many analysts say could eat into profits at the world\\'s largest airline by revenues, while Alitalia bounced higher in the latest round of bet-taking on a rescue deal. \"At Alitalia\\'s request, we have opened an exploratory phase of discussions,\" Spinetta told a results news conference. Air France KLM shares were down 7 percent at 30 euros by 1035 GMT, while Alitalia shares were up 2.8 percent at 0.9685 euros after rising more than 4 percent earlier on Thursday. In Rome, Alitalia said the exploratory talks with Air France KLM about a possible tie-up were not exclusive. It said it was looking for a partnership with a \"sound\" industrial basis. The disclosure of talks came as Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi prepared to raise concerns on the lack of progress at a Franco-Italian summit, and shortly after he challenged Air France KLM in a newspaper interview to take a clearer stand. \"I have always supported contacts between the two groups. Now, I have a lot of doubts. I would like to know Air France\\'s real intentions,\" Prodi told French daily Le Figaro. \"Does it want to create a big European air transport group in which Italy has also its place, or simply to grab the Italian air transport market, which is big and very rich?\" Prodi added. Some French commercial aviation officials welcomed Prodi\\'s comments as they eased their fears that Air France KLM would be pushed into a quick merger with Alitalia. Investors took the opposite view, however, driving Air France KLM shares lower and Alitalia shares upwards. Air France KLM says it has always accepted the idea of a merger in principle, but will not do anything in practice until Alitalia has cleaned up its accounts and is free of what French officials regard as interference from its Italian state owner. ONE VISION? Spinetta said a merger with Alitalia was \"possible\" but would only happen if it created value. The talks will examine how soon Alitalia can halt its losses, whether they share the same vision and how much cash a merger would save, he said. A diplomatic source said Prodi would look into whether the struggling Italian airline could strike a deal with Air France KLM at a summit with French President Jacques Chirac starting with dinner in the Italian town of Lucca later on Thursday. Air France KLM meanwhile reported second-quarter operating profit up 7.8 percent to 568 million euros ($731 million) and hiked synergy targets from its 2004 Franco-Dutch airline merger. Yet even before the Alitalia comments, Air France KLM shares fell around 2 percent on disappointment over cargo losses as well as profit-taking triggered by the airline\\'s failure to dazzle when compared with market forecasts, analysts said. Air France KLM\\'s operating earnings lagged a Reuters survey of analysts who on average predicted 584 million euros. A 19 percent increase in passenger operating profit to 505 million euros met headwinds from a 6 million euro loss in cargo operations, triggered by price pressure in Asia. The group posted a sharp drop in net profit for the three months to end-September to 374 million euros, but this was expected because of a large capital gain a year earlier on the sale of a reservations system stake. The net figure exceeded the Reuters poll average of 360 million euros and compared with 717 million a year earlier. \"The first quarter was excellent, the second was very good,\" said Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, deputy chief executive. \"Reservations for coming weeks are completely in line with the strong activity of the first half. This enables us to confirm our target for a significant increase in (2006-07) operating profit compared to 2005-06,\" Gourgeon said. Air France KLM raised its synergy targets resulting from the 2004 merger of the French and Dutch national carriers from 465 to 500 million euros for 2006/07, from 570 to 605 million euros for 2007/08 and from 670 to 710 million euros for 2008/2009. Group revenues rose 8.8 percent to 6.13 billion euros. The airline\\'s yield, the underlying amount it makes from each passenger, rose 4.7 percent as it adopted a firmer price policy to ease its high load factor, executives said.',\n",
       "  ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German drugs and chemicals group Bayer BAYG.DE said it planned to sell unit H.C. Starck to a consortium formed by Advent International and the Carlyle Group for 700 million euros ($908 million) plus debt. \\n\\n Bayer said in a statement on Thursday the sale of one of its chemicals businesses, including debt of about 450 million euros, would help pay for its 17 billion euro acquisition of rival Schering SCHG.DE. The company aims to create a healthcare group with sales of around 15 billion euros with the Schering acquisition, enabling the merged entity to compete better with big global drugmakers. Shares in Bayer closed up 0.83 percent at 40.09 euros, outperforming a flat German blue-chip DAX  .GDAXI . \"Bayer has fetched a good and fair price for the business,\" said Silke Stegemann, an analyst at Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz. Bayer said the Starck sale, which is expected to close early next year, would cut its net debt by about 1 billion euros and lead to a book gain of 150 million euros. Bayer\\'s net debt stood at 19.95 billion euros at the end of June. The Starck unit, which makes powders of metals such as molybdenum, tungsten and tantalum as well as ceramic powders, had sales of 920 million euros in 2005, up from 703 million euros a year earlier. A German newspaper reported last month that Bayer had received three bids for Starck. They were from Advent and Carlyle in a team, financial investor Bain Capital and Belgian metals maker Umicore ACUMt.BR. A spokesman for the Belgian company, which previously confirmed it was eyeing the business, said that Umicore had no hard feelings about not getting it. \"At this price we have no regret,\" he said, adding that Umicore would continue to monitor the market for investment opportunities. Bayer, which announced the planned sale in March this year, said the buyers intended to continue developing Starck with the aim of positioning the company for a stock market listing in three to five years. Bayer has also sold its diagnostics business to engineering conglomerate Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) for 4.2 billion euros to help pay for Schering.',\n",
       "  ' SANTIAGO, Chile  (Reuters) - Mapuche Indians in Chile are trying to take global software giant Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) to court in a legal battle which raises the question of whether anyone can ever \"own\" the language they speak. \\n\\n The row was sparked by Microsoft\\'s decision last month to launch its Windows software package in Mapuzugun, a Mapuche tongue spoken by around 400,000 indigenous Chileans, mostly in the south of the country. At the launch in the southern town of Los Sauces, Microsoft said it wanted to help Mapuches embrace the digital age and \"open a window so that the rest of the world can access the cultural riches of this indigenous people\". But Mapuche tribal leaders have accused the U.S. company of violating their cultural and collective heritage by translating the software into Mapuzugun without their permission. They even sent a letter to Microsoft founder Bill Gates accusing his company of \"intellectual piracy\". \"We feel like Microsoft and the Chilean Education Ministry have overlooked us by deciding to set up a committee (to study the issue) without our consent, our participation and without the slightest consultation,\" said Aucan Huilcaman, one of the Mapuche leaders behind the legal action. \"This is not the right road to go down.\" FEROCIOUS PEOPLE Microsoft declined to comment on the case, saying they could not do so until it is legally resolved. The company has translated Windows into dozens of indigenous American languages in the past, including Mohawk, Quechua and Inuktitut, but has never faced such vocal opposition. If history is anything to go by, however, the software giant could have a fight on its hands. The Mapuche are renowned for their ferocity. They were one of the few tribes in South America to successfully resist both the Incas, who tried to colonize their lands, and the Spanish, who ruled much of South America for more than two centuries. The Mapuche took their case to a court in the southern city of Temuco earlier this month but a judge ruled it should be considered in Santiago. A judge in the capital is due to decide in the next two weeks whether Microsoft has a case to answer. \"If they rule against us we will go to the Supreme Court and if they rule against us there we will take our case to a court of human rights,\" said Lautaro Loncon, a Mapuche activist and coordinator of the Indigenous Network, an umbrella group for several ethnic groups in Chile. Huilcaman said the Chilean government, which supported Microsoft\\'s project, should concentrate on making Mapuzugun an official state language, alongside Spanish. \"If not, we fear it runs the risk of following the same destiny as Latin, spoken only in universities,\" he said. Mapuzugun is spoken by about two-thirds of Chile\\'s Mapuches, who make up four percent of the population. The case has sparked comment on Internet blogs. Many Chileans appear to feel it is absurd for the Mapuche to claim the intellectual rights to their language, and say the Indians should be pleased to see it used on the world wide Web.',\n",

London Brent crude LCOc1 fell 14 cents at $59.41 after settling down 90 cents the previous day. Prices topped $60 this week after a halt in crude shipments at an Alaskan port, but were dragged down nearly $1 on Wednesday by a surprise 5.1 million barrel rise in U.S. crude inventories. Analysts had expected only a slight, 600,000 barrel build. \"It was a shock announcement, and that really pushed the market down. The drawdown in distillate stocks was nothing too major,\" said Gerard Burg, a resource analyst at the National Australia Bank. The U.S. government\\'s Energy Information Administration said distillate inventories fell by 1.2 million barrels. But the draw was concentrated in diesel, not heating oil, leaving stocks still above last year\\'s levels ahead of peak winter demand. Analysts are eyeing the possibility of further OPEC output cuts, in addition to the 1.2 million barrel per day cut from November made by the producer group in an effort to stem falling prices. \"The sustainable floor is supported by the potential for further OPEC cuts,\" Burg said. But Qatar\\'s Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah said on Thursday oil price fluctuations in the past week made OPEC\\'s decision more difficult. Attiyah last week told Reuters the exporter group had \"no choice but to accept a cut\" when it meets, echoing similar comments from other OPEC ministers. Prices have slid 24 percent since hitting a record $78.40 in mid-July, as bulging fuel stocks in consumer countries and doubts over OPEC output cuts spurred investor selling. Roy Mason of oil consultancy Oil Movements estimated OPEC exports to rise 150,000 bpd in the four weeks to December 9, showing the group falling far short of its pledge. \"From these figures there isn\\'t a cut in exports evident anywhere near the 1.2 million bpd promised by OPEC,\" Mason said.

       "  ' PARIS  (Reuters) - The producer of \"The World According to Bush\" has taken legal action against Google for distributing the film for free, becoming the latest media company to seek compensation for lost business on the Internet. \\n\\n French production house Flach Film said on Thursday it had issued a writ against the U.S. Internet search engine and its French arm, Google France, for copyright infringement before a Paris commercial court. \"The World According to Bush\" is a two-hour film investigating President George W. Bush\\'s administration and the Bush family, including its connections with the Bin Laden family. In a statement, Flach Film also warned that a legal Internet video market could not develop if such practices were allowed. \"Flach Film requests the court to sentence Google to provide compensation for the loss resulting from these illegal acts,\" Flach said, adding that it alleged Google had \"not acted as a simple host but as a fully responsible publisher.\" A spokeswoman for Google France confirmed it had received a complaint from Flach Film after which Google had removed links to the film from its sites. \"Our terms and conditions specify that users (Internet surfers) don\\'t have permission to use videos which they don\\'t own the rights to,\" she said. MEDIA COMPLAINTS While online social networking and file-sharing sites such as YouTube and MySpace enjoy strong popularity, they are also dogged by media companies seeking compensation for downloading of their films, music and videos. Flach said its film was accessible for free on Google Video France through a simple click, as a stream or a download, and according to Google\\'s own sources, had had in excess of 43,000 hits in \"a very short period\". \"We made estimates of the prejudice, and it goes well beyond 500,000 euros ($648,700). The film has been downloaded about 50,000 times, and it has certainly been copied afterwards,\" Jean-Francois Lepetit, producer of the film, told Reuters in a telephone interview. Earlier this month, Google closed its $1.65 billion acquisition of top online video-sharing site YouTube. At the time, Google said one-eighth of the equity, or roughly $200 million, would be held in escrow as security on certain unspecified indemnification obligations. On November 7, Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt denied that his company had set aside $500 million to settle copyright claims by media companies as part of its deal to acquire YouTube. The legal action against Google comes after Universal Music Group, the world\\'s largest music company which is part of Vivendi, last week filed a suit against MySpace for infringing copyrights of thousands of its artists\\' works. The lawsuit accuses News Corp.\\'s MySpace of allowing users to upload videos illegally and taking part in the infringement by re-formatting the videos to be played back or sent to others. MySpace has said its procedures for removing illegal downloads live up to laws protecting digital rights.',\n",
       "  ' BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) filed revised documents with the European Commission on Thursday aimed at complying with a landmark antitrust decision from 2004, the European Commission said. \\n\\n Microsoft met a deadline set by Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, but it will be months before it is clear whether the submission is sufficient to avoid a fine that could be as high as 3 million euros ($3.9 million) a day. The Commission ruled in 2004 that Microsoft had abused its dominant position in the market because Windows, used on more than 95 percent of the world\\'s personal computers, allowed too little interoperability for other software makers. The Commission\\'s decision, it recalled, required Microsoft to \"disclose and license complete and accurate interface documentation which would allow non-Microsoft work group servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers.\" \"Microsoft has submitted a revised version of the Technical Documentation,\" the Commission said in a statement. Asked how long the Commission would take to see whether Microsoft had complied, spokesman Jonathan Todd told a daily briefing: \"It\\'s very difficult to put a precise timing on it but I think we\\'re talking months rather than weeks.\" The Commission set a deadline of July but delayed it until a court proceeding finished in December, 2004. In July, 2006, the Commission fined Microsoft 280.5 million euros for dragging its feet, on top of a fine of almost 500 million euros in 2004 for its initial violation. In a statement calling the submission of documents a \"milestone\", Microsoft said it had completed the review and editing of some 100 documents, which number 8,500 pages. \"We will continue to work closely with the Commission and the (independent) Trustee to ensure that we are in full compliance with every aspect of the Commission\\'s decision,\" the company said in the statement. Microsoft says its actions have been lawful and flatly denied the findings of the European Union. It has appealed the decision to Europe\\'s second highest court, the EU\\'s Court of First Instance. At issue is the low-end market for servers that need to hook up to Windows to manage printers and files. Novell Netware once led the market but the Commission said Microsoft dealt it a body blow by illegally withholding information it needed to interoperate with Windows. During that time Microsoft\\'s market share climbed from about one in three to a dominant four out of five low-end servers. FINES But some businesses can still make use of the documentation. The Commission said it will allow those businesses to review Microsoft\\'s latest effort \"to evaluate whether it contains the necessary information to allow the development of interoperable work group server operating system products.\" At the same time, a Monitoring Trustee appointed by the Commission will test the documentation. If the Commission decides that the documentation is acceptable it will face the question of whether the price Microsoft plans to charge for the protocols is justified. Microsoft could face further fines if the Commission finds that the price was based on Microsoft\\'s exercise of monopoly power, rather than on the originality of its product. Another provision of the decision required the software maker to make available a version of Windows without streaming audio-visual software, which Microsoft has done. Customers have shown no interest in that product, however. Software makers, analysts and investors have keenly watched the long-running battle for its implications for the new Windows operating system Vista, which is due to hit shops in January. Vista has caused concern for the Commission, prompting Microsoft to make some changes and give data to security software makers for interoperability. The Commission is focused in particular on the fixed document format offered by Adobe ( ADBE.O ), and anti-malicious software programmes offered by such companies as McAfee MFE.N and Symantec ( SYMC.O ).',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A wave of business scandals in the \\npast few years has focused much more attention on how companies \\nare run, but even many investor watchdogs don\\'t exactly agree \\non how to assess corporate governance. \\n\\n  Firms such as high-profile proxy adviser Institutional \\nShareholder Services publish corporate governance report cards, \\non issues including executive pay and board independence.  But since each uses its own methodology, the ratings can be \\nall over the map. Some investors do not look too closely at \\ngovernance to start with, and even those who do say the lack of \\nscoring consistency makes it hard to put much stock in them.  \"You can\\'t just accept these ratings at face value,\" said \\nBill Hackney, managing partner at Atlanta Capital Management, \\nwhich oversees $9 billion in investments. \"We don\\'t think you \\ncan distill these issues down to an individual score.\"  Pharmaceuticals company Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ), for example, \\ngets good marks with some ratings services but is near a \\nfailing grade on another, largely because of varying views on \\nhow much weight to place on executive compensation.  Hank McKinnell, a former Pfizer chief executive, walked \\naway with an $83 million retirement package in July, enraging \\nshareholder activists. The stock fell more than 40 percent \\nduring his tenure, which started in 2001.  The Corporate Library, a governance ratings service, gives \\nPfizer a \"D\" grade -- on an \"A\" to \"F\" academic-like scale -- \\nlargely because of compensation issues.  But Pfizer fares far better with other governance graders.  GovernanceMetrics International gives it a 9.5 on a 1 to 10 \\nscale. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) grades Pfizer\\'s \\ngovernance higher than 82.6 percent of the Standard & Poor\\'s \\n500 index components and 99.2 percent of drugs companies.  \"Pfizer traditionally has had very good governance \\npractices,\" said Paul Wanner, an ISS ratings manager. He said \\nISS weighs 65 various governance factors, so while \"we might \\nding them if we feel their compensation is out of whack ... \\nthey may still do very well.\"  In another case, Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) -- which has also \\ndrawn fire from investor activists who say Chairman and CEO \\nRobert Nardelli\\'s generous pay is not in line with the stock \\nperformance -- gets different grades depending on the scorer.  The Corporate Library gives the retailer an \"F,\" but ISS \\nsays it outperforms 94.8 percent of the S&P 500 and 100 percent \\nof fellow retailers. GovernanceMetrics rates it slightly above \\naverage, at 7.5 compared with other U.S. companies.  Pfizer was not immediately available for comment, and Home \\nDepot declined to comment on its ratings.\\n  TRYING TO FIND THE NEXT ENRON  Governance ratings became a hot area a few years ago, \\nfollowing accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom and other big \\ncompanies. The services are aimed mostly at money managers -- \\nthough other clients include plaintiffs\\' lawyers and insurers \\nthat write policies for boards of directors. Subscriptions to \\nthe reports can cost several hundred thousand dollars a year.  The idea \"is to determine where the next Enron might be,\" \\nsaid Shirley Westcott, managing director of policy at Proxy \\nGovernance, a research firm that provides governance analysis \\nbut not quantitative scores. \"A company that gets a low rating \\nis one that I think investors might be cautious about.\"  Critics, though, say assessing governance based on a \\nchecklist of do\\'s and don\\'ts can be difficult.  ISS\\'s proxy service, for instance, was criticized as going \\ntoo far in 2004 when it advised Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) \\nshareholders to withhold support for the re-election of Warren \\nBuffett, the billionaire investor who himself has been an \\noutspoken advocate of board reform, to Coke\\'s audit committee. \\nISS made the recommendation because subsidiaries of Buffett\\'s \\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) also did business with Coke.  The proposal was unsuccessful and Buffett was re-elected. \\nHe stepped down from the Coke board this year, citing increased \\ndemands on his time.  Companies closely track governance report cards. Pfizer has \\na governance \"recognition\" page on its Web site that highlights \\naccolades such as its high ratings from GovernanceMetrics, but \\nit does not mention the low rating from The Corporate Library.  The ratings agencies say they are well aware their \\nmethodology varies widely. The Corporate Library, for example, \\nplaces emphasis on overall effectiveness of companies\\' boards \\n-- not just the governance policies that boards have on paper.  \"Everything that we look at is designed to answer one \\nquestion -- can the board say no to the CEO?\" said Nell Minow, \\na co-founder of The Corporate Library. \"You can have corporate \\ngovernance policies that are so beautiful they should be in an \\nilluminated manuscript, but it doesn\\'t mean that you are \\nfollowing them.\"',\n",
       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Creditors of Anglo-French cross-Channel \\ntunnel operator Eurotunnel EUTL.PA ETL.L are expected to \\napprove a restructuring plan on Monday, should the vote be \\nattended by enough to form a quorum, sources close to the talks \\nsaid. \\n\\n  Fifty-three creditors holding about 4.2 billion pounds of \\ndebt are scheduled to vote on Monday at a Paris court on the \\nplan, which is aimed at saving the company from liquidation.  More than half of the 53 creditors, or their \\nrepresentatives, are required to be present for the vote to \\ntake place.  Holders of two-thirds of the debt are required to back the \\nplan for the proposal to go through. At least 27 creditors need \\nto approve the plan as well for it to pass.  \"If there\\'s quorum, there\\'s a good chance the \\'yes\\' will \\nhave more than 66.6 percent of the votes,\" one of the sources \\nsaid. \"The big issue is the quorum.\"  Oaktree Capital Management LLC, an investment management \\ncompany, will not attend the vote as it would interfere with \\nits present litigation, a source close to Oaktree said.  Oaktree has publicly opposed the plan, which could give \\nshareholders as much as 13 percent of the company after the \\nrestructuring.  Such restructuring often leaves shareholders, who rank \\nafter bondholders as creditors of a troubled company, with \\naround 4 to 6 percent of the equity.  \"It is a very generous amount of equity left to existing \\nshareholders,\" said Phil Roantree, who indirectly owns senior \\nEurotunnel debt as part of the 3 billion pounds of bonds he \\nhelps oversee at New Star Asset Management Ltd. in London.  Still, he would vote in favor of the deal.  \"I would vote in favor just to get this resolved. It has \\nbeen dragging on for such a long time,\" Roantree said.  If creditors voted against the debt restructuring plan, \\nEurotunnel would be liquidated, with its assets sold.  Eurotunnel has struggled to meet interest payments on its \\n6.2 billion pounds of debt.  Following months of often acrimonious negotiations, \\nEurotunnel Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jacques Gounon \\npresented a plan last month under which part of the company\\'s \\ndebt would be turned into equity.

       "  '  (Recasts, adds details) \\n\\n  By  Tim Hepher  and William Emmanuel PARIS  Nov 24 (Reuters) - The mooted Airbus A350 XWB\\nairliner is on hold until top shareholders in parent firm EADS\\n( EAD.PA ) settle differences over how to fund the $10 billion\\nproject, industry sources told Reuters.  A board meeting set for Friday was scrapped because of\\ndisagreement between founding shareholders Lagardere ( LAGA.PA ),\\nDaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE and the French state, one source\\nsaid.  The two industrial shareholders oppose a proposal by France\\nwhich would see the French state take a larger stake in EADS, a\\nsecond source said.  Such a move would dilute their stakes and upset the equal\\nbalance of German and French ownership in the company, a move\\nwhich Germany would oppose.  EADS declined to comment.  \\n  DEVELOPMENT FUNDING  Analysts say EADS could mount a rights issue or new bond,\\nwith some suggesting the company could need 3 billion euros to\\nsee it through development of the A350 XWB (extra wide body).  A weakening dollar is also a threat as planes sell in\\ndollars and EADS sources many components in euros, a currency\\nwhich hit a fresh 19-month high against the dollar on Friday.\\n The company also faces lower-than-expected income for\\nseveral years because of delays of the A380 superjumbo,\\ntriggering speculation that EADS will need to find fresh\\nfunding, possible by attracting new investors.  Russian bank Vneshtorgbank has already bought a stake of\\nmore than 5 percent and the Spanish government has said it could\\nbe interested in raising its 5.5 percent holding.  The exit of top European defence firm BAE Systems BA.L\\nfrom Airbus this year has added to speculation that new\\ninvestors could be on the horizon.  Yet analysts said the French will be hesitant about ceding\\ntoo much control to new investors ahead of French elections set\\nfor next April.  \"I can\\'t see it in the next six months,\" said one\\nLondon-based aerospace analyst, citing the election.  Airbus needs cash to develop the A350, a plane aimed at\\ncatching arch rival Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) in the market for\\nmid-sized, long-range airliners.  The planemaker has spent two years grappling with the design\\nof the A350, ceding a headstart to Boeing which has won more\\nthan 400 orders for its 787 Dreamliner due in 2008.  Airbus this week set forth its long-term market outlook,\\nwhich sees demand for more than 5,000 mid-sized planes over the\\nnext two decades.  The challenge for the planemaker is making sure the A350 XWB\\nis the right design to capture a chunk of that market,\\nespecially as it will likely arrive four years later than the\\nBoeing.  Airbus has secured orders for 100 planes, but they were for\\nearlier proposed versions of the A350. The A350 XWB, which was\\nunveiled in July, has not yet won a single order.  EADS shares plunged in October after the company revealed\\nnew delays to the A380 and gave a profit warning.  The stock was down 0.43 percent at 23.26 euros by 1611 GMT.  Five-year default swaps on EADS were quoted 2 basis points\\nhigher at a 24 basis point mid-price, a trader in London said,\\nalthough he said no trades had gone through at that level.   \"It\\'s obviously not good for sentiment. It\\'s going to cause\\na bit more uncertainty because it\\'s key management issues at\\nEADS, but I don\\'t see it as a massive credit story,\" he said.  EADS Co-Chief Executive Louis Gallois took direct control of\\nAirbus as its new chief executive last month and has pledged a\\ndecision on the A350 by the end of November.  Airbus Chief Operating Officer for Customers John Leahy\\nreiterated this week that the board was set to decide.  \"The market right now is asking us to build the A350 but\\nit\\'s not really up to the market, it\\'s not up to me, it\\'s up to\\nour board,\" Leahy told Reuters on Wednesday.

       "  ' NEW YORK/TAIPEI  (Reuters) - A private equity consortium led by The Carlyle Group CYL.UL is planning to make a $5.5 billion bid for the world\\'s biggest microchip packaging firm, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc. (ASE) ( 2311.TW ) ( ASX.N ), the companies said on Friday. \\n\\n At T$39 a share, the potential Carlyle bid represents a 10 percent premium to Taiwan-based ASE\\'s Friday closing price of T$35.5 a share, and values the firm at about T$179 billion ($5.46 billion), according to Reuters data. The American depositary shares of ASE, which encases silicon chips in plastic packages so they can be connected to circuit boards, rose nearly 15.2 percent to $6.06 in New York trading on Friday. The move is the latest sign of private equity interest in the chip industry, after Freescale Semiconductor Inc. ( FSL.N ) agreed in September to a $17.6 billion leveraged buyout to a group that also included Carlyle. Private equity firms, which look for steady cash flow and long-term growth prospects, are investing in the maturing semiconductor industry as it goes through a phase of slower but steadier growth. \"As a Carlyle affiliated entity, ASE would be in a position to better take advantage of accelerating global outsourcing trends for semiconductor assembly and testing services,\" Carlyle said in a statement. The private equity firm said ASE would benefit from being under the same ownership as Carlyle\\'s other microchip properties, which include Toshiba Ceramics, Jazz Semiconductor and AZ Electronics. ASE said its chief executive, Jason Chang, has agreed to roll his stake in the company into a bid by the consortium, subject to some conditions. Chang and his affiliated holding company, ASE Enterprises Ltd., hold about 18.4 percent of ASE. The company said it had not yet approved a bid. \"Discussions between ASE and the consortium have not been completed, and there can be no assurance that an offer will ultimately be made by the consortium or what the ultimate terms of such an offer would be,\" ASE said in a statement. ASE counts ATI Technologies, Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) and Freescale among its major clients. It competes with smaller Taiwan rival Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. ( 2325.TW ) ( SPIL.O ), U.S.-based Amkor Technology Inc. ( AMKR.O ) and Singapore\\'s STATS ChipPAC Ltd. ( STTS.SI ). Last month ASE said its third-quarter profit more than doubled on recovering chip demand, but it forecast weaker sales and falling profit margins in the fourth quarter. ASE\\'s 2006 net profit is forecast to increase by a quarter to T$18.28 trillion, according to Reuters Estimates. Its forecast earnings per share is T$3.93, making the bid about 10 times forecast earnings, similar to Siliconware. Carlyle also said its planned bid illustrates the firm\\'s confidence in Taiwan, where it has been an active investor since 1999. Its other investments there include Taiwan Broadband Communications and Eastern Multimedia Corp. Earlier this week, U.S. electronics component maker Jabil Circuit Inc. ( JBL.N ) said it planned to buy Taiwan\\'s Green Point Enterprises Co. 3007.TW for around $881 million.

Mazda and Ford want to begin operations in 2009 at the Thai plant, which is to roll out some 200,000 vehicles per year including the 1.3-litre Demio, it said. Mazda is also considering building a new plant on its own in North America, possibly in Mexico, aiming to bring it onstream in the first half of the 2010s, it said. The paper said Mazda positions the Demio as its global strategic vehicle and will export it from Thailand largely to the North American market. Mazda spokeswoman Aya Takahashi said nothing concrete had been decided but the company has been considering various possibilities to boost capacity, both in Japan and abroad, to meet growing demand for its cars in response to higher gas prices and an expected tightening of emission regulations. Mazda might outline ways to add capacity when it announces its next mid-term business plan in the spring, Takahashi said, without giving details. Earlier this month, Mazda posted a 55 percent surge in quarterly operating profit as a weak yen and sales expansion in the West offset slumping domestic demand, and it bumped up its annual forecasts beyond market projections. With volumes steadily growing, analysts say Mazda's most pressing task now is to expand its output capacity -- now at around 1.45 million units globally -- while reducing its high sensitivity to exchange rate swings through local production. Shares in Mazda fell 1.9 percent to 781 yen in morning trade. The benchmark Nikkei average was down 1.3 percent.\",\n",
       "  ' STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Swedish truck maker Scania on Friday stood by its rejection of German rival MAN\\'s hostile bid, as it raised the prospect of further extra shareholder payouts and warned of job losses in Sweden. \\n\\n Scania\\'s second rejection of the 10.3 billion euro ($13.4 billion) offer was the latest salvo in a long war of words between the Swedish company, backed by key shareholder Investor , and its unwelcome suitor. Scania rejected the bid when it was first announced in October. This second rejection comes after MAN released its formal offer document and prospectus last week. \"The board confirms that it continues to unanimously recommend Scania shareholders not to accept the offer ... The board of Scania is of the firm view that the offer from MAN substantially undervalues Scania,\" it said in a statement. Scania in October said it would be able to make a payout to shareholders of 35 crowns a share this year. On Friday, it said it also saw scope for an additional payment in 2007. \"Scania\\'s management is of the opinion that the company would be in the position to distribute an additional amount of up to SEK 10 billion ($1.4 billion) (including ordinary dividend), equivalent to SEK 50 per share,\" Scania said. MAN responded to Scania\\'s fresh rebuttal by saying it was continuing talks with the Swedish firm. Investor and Scania have said they are in contact with MAN but have offered no details. \"We don\\'t think this is good,\" a MAN spokesman said of Scania\\'s planned extra payout. \"The money should rather be invested in the company\\'s growth. This (MAN\\'s bid) would also be more sustainable for the shareholders,\" he added, saying the bid was very good and fair. Major Scania shareholder Investor, the Wallenberg family vehicle that has also rejected MAN\\'s offer, backed the dividend. \"Capital structure is an important factor to create value and we believe that the companies in our portfolio should have as effective capital structures as possible,\" Investor spokesman Fredrik Lindgren said. \"This is a good way to do it and we welcome Scania\\'s suggestion for an extra dividend.\" Volkswagen, which holds stakes in both MAN and Scania, had no immediate comment. NOT A NECESSITY Scania shares closed up 2.15 percent at 475 crowns, while MAN shares were down 2.18 percent at 69.94 euros. When asked about concerns the dividend could hurt Scania\\'s standing with ratings agencies, spokeswoman Cecilia Edstrom said Scania could accept a \"somewhat\" downgraded rating, although this may push up borrowing costs in future. She said the dividends are part of Scania\\'s defense. \"It\\'s important that our shareholders get a clear view of what the share is worth, and by making these dividends they get a better opportunity to make up their minds,\" Edstrom added. A merged MAN-Scania would become the European truck leader, better able to compete with global giants such as DaimlerChrysler and Volvo due to scale advantages in purchasing, spare parts distribution, customer finance and service networks. Scania said a merger could yield possible long-term synergies but only if carefully executed and managed. \"However, short-term these synergies may be widely overstated,\" it added. \"To Scania, consolidation is an opportunity, not a necessity, and the current offer substantially undervalues Scania,\" said board spokesperson Peggy Bruzelius. The Swedish firm also reiterated its view that, because of strong guarantees for workers in deals between MAN and German unions, any job cutbacks would fall heavily in Sweden. MAN on Thursday dismissed the idea of any reductions in production staff at Swedish sites. Ultimately the deal will come down to the support, or lack thereof, from Scania\\'s two largest shareholders, Volkswagen and the Wallenberg family. VW supports the tie-up in principle but has left all options open in case MAN and Scania cannot agree on terms.',\n",
       "  ' DETROIT  (Reuters) - Volvo, a unit of Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ), is recalling about 360,000 cars because of a problem with vehicle speed controls that can cause engines to lose power without warning, Volvo said on Friday. \\n\\n Volvo said a defect in the electronic throttle module in cars built between 1999 and 2002 could cause the vehicle to shift into a \"limp home\" mode in which the maximum speed is about 15 miles per hour. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered the Volvo recall. The recall applies to Volvo C70 and V70 models built between 1999 and 2002, S60 models built between 2001 and 2002, and S70 and V70X models built between 1999 and 2000. Volvo spokesman Christer Gustafsson said the automaker has fixed the speed control problem on about 165,000 vehicles of the recall total after sending out notices to owners in March. California\\'s Air Resource Board had first flagged the throttle control problem. NHTSA informed Volvo that it was making the recall mandatory earlier this month, Gustafsson said. Volvo owners who bring their cars to dealerships will have new software reinstalled for the throttle control unit, he said. \"We\\'re already doing about 2,000 or 3,000 of these a week,\" the Volvo spokesman said. The \"limp home\" setting is a safety feature in Volvo cars intended to prevent unintended acceleration in case of a throttle malfunction, Gustafsson said. Separately, the NHTSA said DaimlerChrysler\\'s DCXGn.DE DCX.N Chrysler Group was recalling about 128,000 Pacifica sport utility vehicles because of a problem with the software governing the fuel pump and power train control. The NHTSA said the defect could cause the engine to stall in some cases. The recall applies to Pacifica models built between 2005 and 2006. Chrysler dealers will reprogram the power train controls and replace the fuel pump on certain cars as part of the recall, the NHTSA said in its recall notice.',\n",

The shares were up 9.2 percent at 56.50 euros at 1027 GMT, valuing the company at 6 billion euros. The stock has risen more than 10 percent so far this year, with most gains booked in the past three weeks on persistent speculation of an ENI bid but has underperformed bigger rival Saipem by 19 percent. Saipem, which is already in French energy services after buying Bouygues Offshore in 2002, traded down 0.97 percent at 18.98 euros. Eni fell 0.53 percent to 24.61 euros. French newspaper La Tribune said ENI was mulling a bid for Technip and that the bid could be submitted early next week. The paper said ENI may want to merge Technip with Saipem ( SPMI.MI ), in which ENI has a 43 percent stake. Technip and Saipem are involved in building pipelines, petrochemical plants and LNG terminals. SCEPTICS Some analysts are skeptical about a bid, saying Saipem is already busy integrating Snamprogetti, the oil services business it bought from another ENI unit, Snam, earlier this year and that customers might not be happy with a reduction of competition in the already tight oil services market. \"I\\'m not sure that from an industrial point of view such a deal would make sense because both companies operate in the same fields (contracting for oil and gas industries) and there won\\'t be any great synergies,\" KBC Securities analyst Antoine Leurent said. Leurent also saw problems for ENI or Saipem retaining Technip\\'s key personnel amid a severe shortage of qualified engineers and project managers in a booming gas and oil services industry. It might also face political hurdles in France where the government has been keen to protect \"strategic\" industries in the energy and utilities sectors. Other analysts think it could be a good time for Saipem to buy because the industry is seen to be on the upturn in the business cycle and Technip\\'s shares have shown some weakness after experiencing problems delivering on some big projects. Les Echos said the issue of a possible Saipem bid for Technip would be discussed at a Franco-Italian summit on Friday, where the two countries may debate a possible tie up between airlines Air France KLM ( AIRF.PA ) and Alitalia AZPIa.MI. Asked whether there were fears at Technip of a possible takeover from Saipem, the Technip spokeswoman replied: \"That is a purely theoretical question.\" Last Friday Technip Chairman and Chief Executive Daniel Valot was cool on a tie-up with Saipem, following earlier speculation. \"Personally, it looks to me like a bizarre idea,\" Valot told Reuters. The bid speculation has swirled as Valot prepares to retire next April after seven years at the helm of the company and after the company issued two profit warnings earlier this year. Valot conceded last week that he considered Technip a potential takeover target due to its free float of over 80 percent but said with recent spikes in its share price, the price tag might deter potential bidders. The oil services industry is currently going through a boom on the back of a resurgence in spending by oil majors on exploration and production, spurred on by high oil prices.

( KO.N ) to the U.S. giant for around $700 million, industry sources said. \\n\\n The sources said officials from both companies had shook hands on the deal, but the Philippines' second-largest listed group said on Friday it was still in talks with Atlanta-based Coca Cola about a sale of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc.  (CCBPI). The statement on Friday did not mention a price. Coca Cola currently owns 35 percent of CCBPI, which has been suffering from weak sales as consumers turn to noncarbonated drinks like fruit juice and ice tea. Coke and San Miguel opened talks on their CCBPI holdings early this year. Their five-year bottler's agreement, which covers royalty charges and bottling restrictions on Coke products, ended in July. Analysts who attended a briefing by San Miguel recently said that a deal would be finalized in January and would involve a non-compete clause that would prevent the Philippine company from selling fizzy drinks in the next five years. CCBPI had first-half revenue of 19 billion pesos ($377.3 million), down 4 percent from a year earlier.

       "  ' TOKYO  (Reuters) - Struggling Japanese electronics maker Sanyo Electric Co. said on Friday it now expects to fall into the red this business year as it unveiled more job cuts amid weak sales of digital cameras and mobile phones. \\n\\n The layoffs are part of the latest in a string of restructuring moves by Sanyo, which has already cut 15 percent of its workforce and issued $2.6 billion worth of shares to three banks at a deep discount to shore up its wobbly finances. Sanyo said the new reform measures would cost it about 40 billion yen ($344 million), which along with tumbling prices of mobile phones and digital cameras forced it to revise down its forecast for the year to March to a loss of 50 billion yen. The new forecast marks a sharp reversal from its prior estimate for a 20 billion yen profit and would bring its combined losses over the past three years to about $3.7 billion. It cut its annual sales estimate by 8 percent to 2.2 trillion yen. Given the dire conditions, some investors were looking for more drastic measures such as pulling out of businesses. Sanyo denied a newspaper report that it was looking to spin off its cellphone division and sell most of it to a competitor. \"If management is not willing to be daring, the company will not be able to survive,\" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. For the six months ended September 30, Sanyo reported a group net loss of 3.62 billion yen, beating its own forecast by about 4 billion yen and a big improvement on the 142.53 billion yen loss a year earlier when restructuring costs battered its bottom line. On an operating level, Sanyo was able to return to profitability thanks in large part to cost cuts in its semiconductor unit as well as strong sales of commercial products such as showcase refrigerators. But it has been hit by fierce price competition in the digital camera market from low-cost Taiwanese makers and was beaten to the market by Motorola Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in launching an ultra-slim mobile phone. The downturn in mobile phones and cameras is particularly worrisome for Sanyo because they have been positioned as core businesses indispensable to its recovery, along with rechargeable batteries and solar cells. \"We were late to adapt to rapid changes in the mobile phone market,\" Sanyo Vice President Koichi Maeda told a news conference. BROKEN PROMISES Sanyo has already suffered a series of setbacks this year. In June, Nokia scrapped a plan to jointly make mobile phones with Sanyo. And in August Sanyo announced that an alliance with Quanta Computer Inc. in the TV business would be much narrower than initially hoped. The 2,200 job cuts are equal to about 2 percent of Sanyo\\'s global workforce of 105,000. It also plans to shift more production of mobile phones overseas and reduce the number of its affiliates by 100 from 300 over the next three years. Those measures will come on top of a restructuring plan last year under which it eliminated 14,000 jobs, spun off its loss-making chip division and sold a stake in debt-laden Sanyo Electric Credit Co. to reduce its debt burden. \"Making sure the company is on course for profitability next year is my responsibility,\" Iue said, indicating that he would not resign over this year\\'s loss. \"We will accelerate restructuring and finish it all this year.\" Investors have heard that before. At a general shareholders\\' meeting on February 24, Iue asked for \"one more chance\" in seeking approval for a 300 billion yen issue of preferred shares that will lead to a massive dilution of existing share value. Since that day Sanyo\\'s shares have lost about 40 percent of their value and earlier this week hit a 31-year low. The stock closed Friday down 1.64 percent at 180 yen, against a 1.13 percent fall in the benchmark Nikkei average Because the preferred shares are convertible to common stock at 70 yen, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Daiwa Securities SMBC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. still stand to make a tidy profit if they were to convert their shares at current levels. But the banks are expected to step up the pressure on Sanyo to take bolder restructuring steps. In addition to selling the cellphone business, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported this week that Sanyo would look to unload its chip operations as well. In light of this year\\'s downturn, Sanyo cut its net profit forecast for the next business year to March 2008 to 20 billion yen from a previous target of 62 billion yen. It cut its 2007/08 operating profit forecast roughly in half to 50 billion yen.',\n",

Among other standout decliners were insurers, such as Prudential ( PRU.L ) and Old Mutual ( OML.L ), dropping about 2 percent as traders cite the dropping off of bid speculation that has swirled the sector in recent weeks. By 1232 GMT the pan-European FTSEurofirst index  .FTEU3  of 300 leading shares fell 1 percent to 1,447.38 points, after hitting a three-week intraday low, while the index is still up almost 15 percent since the start of the year. Around Europe, London\\'s FTSE 100  .FTSE  was down 0.8 percent, while the French CAC 40  .FCHI  dropped 0.9 percent and Germany\\'s DAX  .GDAXI  was down 1.3 percent. Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, analyst at Germany\\'s Postbank, said the long-term view was still positive. \"The reaction is too strong, and that\\'s because Wall Street is missing,\" he said, adding that he expects U.S. market volumes to be low a day after Thanksgiving holiday. \"I interpret this as a healthy correction,\" Frank Schallenberger, market analyst at German state bank LBBW, said. \"When the dollar gets a dizzy spell, obviously everything to do with exports suffers, especially cars,\" he said. The euro rose to a 1-1/2 year high versus the dollar , extending gains rapidly after breaching the key $1.30 level. By 1224 GMT, the euro had risen as high as $1.3109  EUR= . The dollar also hit its lowest level against the yen in nearly three months at 115.62 yen  JPY= . \"I think the euro could settle at around $1.30. As long was we don\\'t go towards $1.40 this shouldn\\'t be a big burden,\" Schallenberger said. Gerard Piasko, Chief Investment Officer at Julius Baer Private Banking, added: \"I don\\'t think it will go to $1.40.\" The strong euro, which gained on Thursday on the back of a rise in Germany\\'s business confidence, increased the likelihood of more monetary tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB). European aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ) shed 1.2 percent after an industry source said disagreement over the funding of a $10-billion new plane project at Airbus forced the parent firm EADS to cancel a Friday board meeting. Shares in Britain\\'s Fuller, Smith & Turner Plc ( FSTA.L ), the brewer of London Pride, fell more than 4 percent after its chief executive said they would consider making larger acquisitions following the successful purchase of George & Co in 2005. German industrial firm Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) fell 2 percent after its labor union said a deal to support employees of its former mobile phone unit, which it had sold to Taiwan\\'s BenQ, would cost the firm around 140 million euros following the insolvency of BenQ\\'s German mobile business. On the up side, Italian airline Eurofly EEZ.MI rose 9 percent, extending gains driven by speculation about a tie-up, traders said.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar fell sharply on Friday, pushing the euro above $1.31 for the first time since April 2005, on concerns about central banks diversifying their reserves and the greenback\\'s narrowing yield advantage over other currencies. \\n\\n The dollar\\'s fourth consecutive session of weakness was the culmination of a host of negative developments over the last several weeks, including weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data and comments from central banks in Asia and the Middle East underscoring the risk of keeping large reserves of dollars. \"It is the aggregate accumulation of these bearish bits and pieces that has the dollar on the defensive,\" said Dennis Gartman, an independent investment advisor who writes the Gartman Letter. The euro had risen to its highest in 19 months, at $1.3109  EUR= , a little more than 5 cents away from a record high set in late 2004. By mid-afternoon it was trading at $1.3100, up 1.2 percent from Thursday. Sterling was up 0.9 percent at $1.9320  GBP= , having hit a near two-year high of $1.9350, while the dollar sank to its lowest since June 2006 against the Swiss franc, at 1.2075 francs  CHF= . The dollar was down 0.5 percent at 115.75 yen  JPY= , after dropping to a 2-1/2-month low against the low-yielding Japanese currency because of a broad unwinding of carry trades. In such trades, an investor would borrow yen and invest in assets denominated in a higher-yielding currency. \"The triggering of stop loss orders on Friday has intensified carry trade liquidation in a low liquidity environment,\" said Kathy Lien, chief strategist with Forex Capital Markets in New York. Dealers also said the sharp drop in the dollar overnight had wrongfooted some in the market, prompting a bout of rapid-fire short covering and a subsequent spike in volatility, which only weighed further on the dollar. In the options market, implied volatility of 1-month to 1-year euro/dollar contracts rose sharply, suggesting heavy demand to buy options in anticipation of higher prices and higher spot market levels. Next week\\'s heavy slate of U.S. economic releases, including the ISM manufacturing activity index, a gauge of core inflation and a revised look at growth in gross domestic product in the third quarter, could determine whether the dollar sustains this week\\'s losses. \"We\\'ve had some pretty good numbers out of Europe, and so the risk for me is that over the next few weeks, we get some more sloppy data out of the United States in the manufacturing and housing sectors,\" Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist with TD Securities in Toronto. Thin volume has contributed to the dollar\\'s 2 percent decline this week against a basket of major currencies .DXY, its largest weekly fall since at least July. Indeed, there were few catalysts overnight for the dollar\\'s latest drop. Wu Xiaoling, vice governor of the People\\'s Bank of China, said in an academic paper that the reserves of East Asian nations were at risk from too much exposure to the falling dollar. Investors are wary that China, which holds the world\\'s biggest foreign exchange reserves of more than $1 trillion, might diversify out of dollar assets. Such speculation helped the euro rise to a record high above $1.36 in late 2004. Market positioning won\\'t be a factor preventing a further decline in the dollar anytime soon. Even though the greenback has sold off, JPMorgan said, speculative investors are holding a net short dollar position that\\'s 1.1 times the average position of the last 12 months, the largest since early October. But that is not nearly as large as the 5 times average in April. Short positions are essentially bets that an asset price will fall.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar plummeted on Friday, denting Wall Street stocks but triggering a flight into safe-haven assets, such as U.S. Treasuries and gold. \\n\\n U.S. stocks slipped on \"Black Friday\" -- the day after Thanksgiving that traditionally marks the start of the holiday shopping season -- as the fall in the dollar reignited concern over inflation. These losses were partly offset earlier by a rally in mining shares on a rally in the gold price, which gained over 1 percent as the dollar sank across the board. \"We\\'re seeing some real weakness for the dollar, so that\\'s kind of spooking investors\" said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Client Services in New York. The greenback hit its lowest level in over eighteen months against the euro, while the British pound neared two-year highs as concern over foreign central banks paring back their dollar holdings and the dollar\\'s narrowing yield advantage over other currencies weighed heavily. The U.S. currency\\'s fourth consecutive session of weakness was a culmination of a host of dollar-negative developments over the past few weeks, including surprisingly soft U.S. economic data and comments from Asian and Middle East central banks. Buoyed by signs of solid euro zone economic growth and likely higher interest rates, the euro broke through the psychological barrier of $1.30 for the first time in 1-1/2 years as the dollar weakened across the board. Britain\\'s pound was up over 0.8 percent at a near two-year high above $1.93, while the dollar was down 1.2 percent against the Swiss franc and down 0.3 percent against the yen at 115.8 yen. \"We\\'ve had some pretty good numbers out of Europe, and so the risk for me is that, over the next few weeks, we get some more sloppy data out of the United States in the manufacturing and housing sectors,\" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist with TD Securities in Toronto. U.S. government bond prices, meanwhile, edged modestly higher, leaving yields near nine-month lows, even though traders said the flight-to-quality flows could dry up if the dollar continues to fall as this would undermine the value of any dollar-denominated assets. \"The dollar\\'s plunge on a day when many U.S. trading desks are thinly staffed is not a catalyst for foreign accounts to start shifting money out of Treasuries yet, as the U.S. government bond rally appears to confirm,\" said George Goncalves, Treasury and agency trading strategist with Banc of America Securities in New York. The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR was up 7/32 at 100 19/32 in price for a yield of 4.55 percent, having hit a low of 4.53 percent earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 46.78 points, or 0.38 percent, to end at 12,280.17. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 5.14 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish at 1,400.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  declined 5.72 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 2,460.26. The stock market closed early after the Thursday\\'s Thanksgiving holiday. U.S. stocks were already off to a shaky start after European stock indexes shed well over 1 percent on worries about exporters\\' future earnings with the surge in the euro. Prospects of a slowdown in the U.S. economy and potentially lower U.S. interest rates have combined with concerns about fundamental economic imbalances to put the dollar under pressure. However, if the current decline lasts, a soaring euro could lower the horizon for European Central Bank interest rate rises. The stronger yen also hurt Japanese stocks with the Nikkei ending down 1.13 percent. In U.S. futures trading, the December gold contract GCZ6 at the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped $9.60 to trade at $638.60 an ounce. Gold often moves in the opposite direction from the dollar and is also widely viewed as a hedge against inflation.

       "  ' LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil rose towards $60 a barrel on Friday, drawing strength from a disruption to supply in Nigeria and as a fall in the U.S. dollar boosted other commodities. \\n\\n The price of oil had dropped nearly $1 on Wednesday after a U.S. government report showed crude stocks rose a more-than-expected 5.1 million barrels last week, adding to ample supplies. \"It\\'s been pretty weak recently so maybe a rally is not unexpected,\" said Christopher Bellew, an oil futures broker at Bache Financial in London. U.S. crude rose 66 cents to $59.90 a barrel. London Brent gained 74 cents to $60.09 by 1815 GMT, when the market closed early due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Supporting the market, Italian oil company Eni declared a force majeure on exports from the Okono terminal in Nigeria after it was attacked, ship agent Gulf Agency Company said late on Thursday. Prices were vulnerable to wider fluctuations as the New York Mercantile Exchange was shut for the two-day Thanksgiving holiday but electronic trade continued. \"Because of the holiday it\\'s light volume and that sets the stage for volatility,\" said Mike Wittner, oil analyst at investment bank Calyon in London. DOLLAR FALL The fall in the U.S. dollar boosted the price of precious metals such as gold, but some analysts were skeptical oil was moving in reaction to the U.S. currency. \"Historically, oil is much less strongly correlated to currency movements than other commodities,\" said Kevin Norrish, oil analyst at Barclays Capital in London. At the same time, a weaker dollar could encourage OPEC to seek a higher oil price because its income from dollar-denominated oil sales is eroded. The oil minister for OPEC\\'s smallest producer, Qatar, on Friday played down the fall in the dollar. \"The currency is always volatile and we have to live with it,\" Abdullah al-Attiyah told reporters in New Delhi. \"OPEC\\'s decisions are not related to the strengthening or weakening dollar, but are driven by demand and supply.\" A slide in the dollar in 2003, when oil was half today\\'s price at around $30, prompted top world exporter Saudi Arabia to say it was seeking to defend higher prices than previously. Oil\\'s descent from a record of $78.40 hit in July prompted the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in October to cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day from November 1. On Thursday, the Qatari minister had dulled down comments he made last week on the prospect of a further cut in OPEC output at a meeting next month. \"It\\'s too early now to jump to the front seat and say what we will do, what is the quantity if we want to cut,\" he told reporters in Seoul. Prices over the past few weeks have dipped below $55 before rebounding to around $60 despite bulging U.S. inventories and warm winter in the United States suppressing demand.

Other precious metals followed gold\\'s upward move. \"The market is trying to get up to $640 an ounce at some point, but there are some sell orders around there,\" said a precious metals trader in London. \"The dollar is weak at the moment.

Spot gold XAU= was quoted at $639.30/640.30 an ounce by 1453 GMT, up from $630.30/631.30 late in London on Thursday. Gold was helped by the euro, which shot above $1.31 for the first time since April 2005, extending sharp gains made this week as a combination of euro-positive factors finally triggered a break-out of long-established ranges. Gold often moves in the opposite direction to the dollar and is generally seen as a hedge against inflation. \"This move in the dollar, if sustained, will see precious metals prices gain further ground,\" said a market report from UBS Investment Bank, which saw gold prices at $640 in one month and $670 in three months from now. Dealers said prices were vulnerable to wider fluctuations due to the lower numbers of players in the market. New York commodities and energy markets will remain closed on Friday for the Thanksgiving holiday, re-opening on Monday. \"Gold is gaining and $650 an ounce must be the target.

Crude oil prices CLc1 rose 1 percent to $59.90 a barrel in London, adding to worries about consumer spending. One catalyst for the higher oil prices was the disruption of exports from Nigeria after a major oil terminal there was attacked. On the Nasdaq, shares of Intel Corp.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - This year\\'s \"Black Friday\" could be the strongest opening to the holiday shopping season in years if the droves of Americans eager to exploit early-bird specials are any guide. \\n\\n Terry Lundgren, chief executive of Federated Department Stores Inc., told Reuters he arrived at the company\\'s flagship Macy\\'s store in Manhattan at 5:30 a.m. to find lines wrapped completely around the building, which takes up a whole city block. \"I\\'ve been coming here for many years at the same time on this particular day, and this looks like the largest crowd we\\'ve seen in years,\" Lundgren said. The sunny, cold weather was good for shopping, especially for coats and cashmere sweaters, he added. Early shoppers were treated to deals such as a five-piece luggage set for $49.99 and a one-carat diamond circle pendant for less than $100, Lundgren said. Consumers see the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday -- called \"Black Friday\" because it once marked the day many retailers turned a profit, or went into the black, for the year -- as the first day of the holiday shopping season and a time to snag bargains, freebies and sales. It used to be the year\\'s busiest shopping day, but people looking for last-minute gifts have transferred that honor to the Saturday before Christmas. Still, the Thanksgiving weekend accounts for up to 10 percent of holiday sales, according to analyst Dana Telsey of independent research firm Telsey Group. \"We were extremely surprised by how promotional the circulars and the advertisements have been,\" said Ellen Davis, senior director of the National Retail Federation. \"Retailers really went all-out to offer some substantial discounts this weekend to bring people into their stores.\" \"Everything we\\'ve seen indicates that consumers are responding,\" Davis said, adding that people were lined up across the country, trying to get bargains on toys, electronics and accessories. Britt Beemer, chairman of America\\'s Research Group, said 64 percent of respondents in a survey he conducted said they planned to shop early, lured by a flurry of early-bird specials, up from 48 percent last year. People even spent the night outside the Mall of America, near Minneapolis, Minnesota, in order to grab gift-bags offered to the first 250 people in line at the mall\\'s gingerbread house. The enthusiasm even extended online. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\\'s Web site saw a bigger-than-expected traffic surge early on Friday that caused temporary problems accessing the site. But a spokeswoman said that Friday-only deals that originally had been slated to end at 11 a.m. PST would be extended through midnight. Toys \"R\" Us Chief Executive Gerald Storch said this year\\'s hot toys -- such as T.M.X. Elmo and video-game consoles Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii -- made for more exciting selections than in years past. He said Toys \"R\" Us, which opened at 5 a.m., started the day with thousands of plush Elmo toys, but a sales associate at the company\\'s flagship store in New York\\'s Times Square said just after 6:30 a.m. that it had sold out. About Nintendo\\'s game console, which launched on November 19, Storch said the store had already sold tens of thousands and would have tens of thousands more available soon. \"It may not be in stock every hour of every day at every store,\" Storch told Reuters. \"But we are constantly getting replenishment of Nintendo Wiis.\" Laura Richardson, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, said the stocks of companies that sell electronics, including Best Buy Co. Inc., Circuit City Stores Inc. and Staples Inc. would be among the winners this season. \"Best Buy was just unbelievable,\" Richardson said of the crowds at the Tysons Corner, Virginia, outpost of the retailer. \"It was so bad I couldn\\'t even wait in the line.\" Best Buy is selling a 42-inch Panasonic Plasma high-definition television for just under $1,000. Retailers this year used special promotions and longer hours to attract consumers, some of whom have been spending less because of higher interest rates. In some cases, long lines to get into stores and at check-out counters caused some shoppers to have second thoughts. Monique Hand and a friend left home in Paterson, New Jersey, at 2:30 a.m., bound for New York\\'s Woodbury Common outlet center, which opened at midnight. But when they arrived two hours later, the crowds, lines and a full parking lot were too much to handle, Hand said. The women headed back to New Jersey\\'s Westfield Garden State Plaza, which did not open until 7 a.m. but promised free coffee and massages to early birds. \"I\\'ll never do this again,\" said Hand\\'s companion, who preferred not to give her name. Disney Stores, many of which opened at 5 a.m., were discounting their entire stock by 20 percent until 10 a.m. And Manhattan\\'s famed toy emporium FAO Schwarz didn\\'t bother to wait until Friday. It opened its doors on Thanksgiving Day. Jeff Dugan, an office technology manager who came shopping with his wife at the Garden State Mall after they could not get into the parking lot of a Best Buy in West Paterson, New Jersey, at 6 a.m., said getting up so early was not worth it. \"Our plan didn\\'t work ... we came out too late at 6 a.m.,\" Dugan said. Trading in retail stocks was thin on Friday, with the Standard & Poor\\'s Retail index closing down less than 1 percent. Best Buy shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $55.08, down 76 cents, while Wal-Mart closed at $47.90, down 13 cents.

       "  ' MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russian steel maker Severstal ( CHMFq.L ) is in negotiations to buy Weirton Steel Corp. of the United States from Mittal Steel ( MT.N ) ( ISPA.AS ), Russian paper Kommersant reported on Friday, without naming its source. \\n\\n Severstal ( CHMF.MM ) ( CHMF.RTS ) declined to comment. Kommersant said Mittal, the world\\'s largest steel maker, might be required to sell Weirton Steel in place of Canadian steel maker Dofasco to satisfy anti-monopoly regulation after the company\\'s merger with Arcelor CELR.PA. A Dutch foundation holding the shares of Dofasco this month refused a request that would have allowed the sale of the Canadian unit to Germany\\'s Thyssenkrupp ( TKAG.DE ). U.S. regulators have said Arcelor Mittal would have to sell either Weirton Steel -- a West Virginia-based producer of about 3 million tonnes a year of steel -- or its Sparrows Point plant in Maryland should its planned sale of Dofasco be blocked. \"While this is clearly a preliminary report, and the transaction may never occur, we believe that such a combination would benefit Severstal by giving it more exposure to the U.S. market,\" Moscow brokerage Aton said in a note. Severstal, which raised just over $1 billion placing shares in London this month, plans to acquire more assets on the way to becoming the world\\'s second-largest steel maker, its 41-year-old billionaire owner, Alexei Mordashov, has said. The company, Russia\\'s largest steel maker if foreign assets are included, already has a presence in North America after its purchase of Rouge Steel. Other Russian firms are looking to join them. Evraz Group HK1q.L, Russia\\'s top steel maker by domestic volume, this week announced the $2.3 billion purchase of Oregon Steel Mills OS.N, while NLMK ( NLMKq.L ) plans a joint venture with steel trader and producer Duferco to acquire assets in Europe and the United States. Another report by Kommersant was cited as a factor in United States Steel Corp. ( X.N ) shares rising more than 8 percent on November 17. The newspaper said Severstal and Metalloinvest, a rival steel firm owned by billionaire Alisher Usmanov, were discussing a merger and possible bid for U.S. Steel. Weirton Steel is the eight-largest steel maker in the United States and the country\\'s second-largest producer of tin-plated steel products, Aton said. Severstal\\'s London-traded global depositary receipts closed on Thursday at $11.50, a dollar below the placement price.',\n",

Deliveries of the A380, the world\\'s biggest commercial airliner, are two years behind schedule, partly due to problems with installing wiring on the aircraft. Airbus parent EADS said on Tuesday it had had no fresh order cancellations for the A380 since FedEx Express, a unit of FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ), terminated an order for 10 of the A380-800F freighter version this month. A delegation from Emirates airline EMAIR.UL, the biggest buyer of the plane, visited Airbus manufacturing plants last week to assess progress on re-cabling the aircraft. \"Our engineers have returned from Toulouse.

       "  \" VANCOUVER, British Columbia  (Reuters) - The pension fund for Ontario's teachers said on Thursday it will buy four North American marine container terminals from Orient Overseas (International) Ltd. ( 0316.HK ) for $2.4 billion. \\n\\n The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan said it is the sole purchaser of New York Container Terminal on Staten Island in New York City, the Global Terminal and Container Systems, Inc in Bayonne, New Jersey, and TSI Terminal Systems Inc., which operates the Deltaport and Vanterm facilities in Vancouver. Vancouver is Canada's largest port. Trading in Orient's shares had been halted on Wednesday amid speculation about the pending sale of the Hong Kong firm's North American operations, although the Ontario group was not listed among the likely buyers in media reports. Orient Overseas had said that it wanted to sell the terminals to reinvest the money in its shipping business. It had announced in October that it would buy four container ships for $477 million. The pension plan said the terminals had combined annual sales of about $500 million. They will be included in the fund's infrastructure and timber portfolio, which will have assets of about $6.5 billion with this acquisition. Container freight rates have gradually recovered from the lows of earlier in the year, but there are concerns that looming overcapacity and slower economic growth in the United States and elsewhere will continue to put pressure on the shipping industry. The fund, one of Canada's largest, with assets of about $84 billion, administers the pensions of 163,000 elementary and secondary school teachers and 101,000 retired teachers in the Canadian province of Ontario. The deal is subject to regulatory approval in both the United States and Canada. ($1=$1.14 Canadian)\",\n",

OOIL said in a statement it would review the potential uses of the proceeds from the sale and may use the money to expand its core business and to make a special dividend and share buyback.

       "  ' WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Here\\'s an uncomfortable housing \\nscenario that\\'s getting more common in this soft market: You \\nput in a contract on a new house. You can\\'t sell your old \\nhouse. The sellers are getting pushy. \\n\\n  What are you going to do?  It\\'s a fact. More homeowners are singing a \"stuck in the \\nmiddle with you\" duet with their real estate agents. It\\'s \\nscary, because you can end up facing a situation with two \\nhouses, three loans and financial ruin. Or, watching the home \\nyou want slip away.  \"These bridging homeowners are in nervous circumstances,\" \\nsays Eric Cunliffe, of realestate.com, a Web site that seeks to \\ngenerate leads for real estate agents. \"They should have one \\ngoal: sell that home as fast as they can.\"  It may help to know that even in a post-bubble real estate \\nmarket, it doesn\\'t take forever to sell a house.  In many markets, houses are taking almost twice as long to \\nsell as they did a year ago, but they are still selling in just \\na few months. In California, where the market can seesaw \\nerratically, houses are selling in 54 days instead of the 30 \\nthey were turning over in last year. In popular Monterey \\nCounty, they are closing in 106 days from when they are placed \\non the market. In slow-market Columbus, Ohio, houses are \\nsitting for fewer than 100 days.  So, avoid the urge to panic, and consider these other moves \\nif you\\'re one of those homeowners who feels stuck in the \\nmiddle. Take it from someone who was once there, (I will spare \\nyou the ugly details) you will eventually get to the other \\nside.  -- Write a waiting budget. Calculate the monthly cost of \\nwhat you\\'re giving up by carrying your old home for a while. \\nThat would include payments for taxes, insurance, utilities and \\nthe interest portion of your monthly mortgage payment. Once you \\nhave a dollar figure in mind, you\\'ll know how much of an actual \\nstrain it will be to have both houses for a while. You will \\nknow whether it\\'s worth dropping the price to get out of the \\nhouse fast.  -- Use your financing to buy some breathing room. Sign up \\nfor the biggest possible loan you can get on your new home, as \\nrates are comparatively low. That will free you from having to \\nget a specific price for the house you want to sell. Even if \\nyou end up getting less than you expected, you still won\\'t fall \\nshort on your downpayment for your next house. If, after you\\'ve \\nsettled on the house you are selling, you want to cut your \\ndebt, you can use extra money from the sale of your first house \\nto pay down your second home loan, either all at once or \\nmonthly.  There are other short-term financing solutions. If you have \\nsufficient home equity and a home equity line of credit on your \\nfirst home, you can write yourself a check for the downpayment \\non your second loan. But then you\\'ll have to make three loan \\npayments for a while: the one on your old mortgage, the one on \\nyour new mortgage, and the one on your home equity line.  You can also get a bridge loan against the equity in your \\nfirst home to pay for the move-in costs of your second home, \\nfrom a lender willing to wait for his money until the first \\nhome settles. But they usually last only six months, and they \\ncan be costly and nerve racking.  -- Think of alternatives. You can keep both houses for a \\nwhile and rent out the one you\\'re vacating, but then you\\'ve got \\nto be ready to put in the time and effort to be a landlord. You \\ncould drop the price of the house you\\'re selling to a \\ndesperation level, just to get it to move fast. But you might \\nregret that later when you see more patient homeowners getting \\nmore for their houses.  -- Take the emotions out of it. Cunliffe tells homeowners \\nto back away from the feelings they have about selling a house \\nthat isn\\'t selling easily. It\\'s a business deal. The market \\nisn\\'t what it was a year ago, so don\\'t beat yourself up if you \\nhave to take less money. Once you\\'ve completed both halves of \\nyour move, you\\'ll forget the pain.  -- Be ready to walk away if the situation demands it. If \\nyour closing date on the new home is approaching and you know \\nyou absolutely, positively can\\'t afford both, approach the \\nsellers with a request for a delay. If that doesn\\'t work, \\nprepare yourself to lose the new house. That may be hard to \\ntake, but there are other houses out there. And, it\\'s better \\nthan losing your shirt.  -- Take the personality out of your house, too: A home \\nthat\\'s been decluttered and had its rooms painted a neutral \\nivory shade will move faster than one that\\'s adorned with all \\nof your knickknacks, regardless of how wonderful they are.  Conventional wisdom holds that a home will sell faster and \\nfor more money if it has curb appeal, new carpeting, a good \\nlooking entryway, bread baking in the oven, and closets that \\nare almost empty. Don\\'t go too far, though: If you move out of \\nyour house before you sell it, make sure you leave enough \\nfurniture behind so prospective buyers can visualize it as a \\nplace that\\'s lived in.  -- Price it right. Even during the boom, real estate agents \\nwere telling customers to low-ball the prices of their homes; \\nthe ensuing bidding wars would ensure they\\'d get enough cash \\nout of it anyway. Now they\\'re telling people to low-ball their \\nhomes to make sure they sell rapidly in this environment.  \"Don\\'t go the death-by-1,000-cuts route\" of testing a high \\nprice and then lowering it every month, says Cunliffe. \"Buyers \\nare watching properties and they\\'ll just try to negotiate the \\nprice down even further.\"  (Linda Stern is a freelance writer.

       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - More and more people have literally \\nfound life on the Internet as the estimated $3 billion \\nfertility industry moves increasingly online. \\n\\n  But as with all online commercial ventures, shopping on the \\nWeb can carry risks.  In this case, the Internet may provide consumers -- often \\npeople desperate to have a child -- a faster and more discreet \\nway to find egg or sperm donors. But it can also lead to lost \\nmoney and broken dreams, say fertility experts.  \"It\\'s not surprising that much of this business is \\nmigrating into Cyberspace. Most people don\\'t mind buying a \\nLands\\' End item at the store, but it\\'s awkward to buy eggs in \\npublic,\" said Professor Debora Spar of Harvard Business School, \\nan advocate for regulation of the U.S. fertility industry.  While procuring an egg online still involves more than \\nsimply clicking on a shopping cart, says Spar, many people do \\nnot realize all the steps and attention required to adequately \\nmatch, screen and coordinate recipients with donors.  Other experts say hopeful recipients may be asked by less \\nreputable egg donor sites to pay large, nonrefundable sums \\nupfront to see profiles, or be made to wait for months for \\ndonors that never materialize.  The cost of a donated egg has soared from about $2,500 a \\nfew years ago to as much as $35,000 in some cases as lack of \\nregulatory oversight has enabled a new breed of marketers \\ncalled \"egg hunters\" to act as Internet brokers between \\nrecipients and donors, said Dr. Drew Moffitt, co-medical \\ndirector of the Arizona Reproductive Medicine Specialists, an \\ninfertility practice.  Indeed, a random Google search of the phrase \"egg donor\" \\ncalled up nearly 1.2 million links. Some proclaimed things like \\n\"Hot & Smart Egg Donors,\" while others bore ads aimed at \\nstudents by offering sums like $7,000 for eggs to pay for \\nbooks, college and \"elective\" surgery.  \"The introduction of the egg hunters has been one of the \\nthings that has led to the escalation of fees. The real loser \\nin this whole game winds up being the recipient,\" said Moffitt.  Experts say women should also be wary of big payoffs that \\noften blind them to the realities and risks of being a donor, \\nwhich can be a time-consuming and invasive process. Some may \\nalso later regret that another woman is raising children they \\nhelped to create, they said.  \"I am shocked because every time I go online, there are \\nanother five egg donor agencies, promising things like lots of \\ninstant money and even plastic surgery in exchange for eggs,\" \\nsaid Shelley Smith, director of Los Angeles-based The Egg Donor \\nProgram, established in 1992.  To be sure, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does \\nregulate the handling of any human tissue, while two \\nprofessional groups; the American Society of Reproductive \\nMedicine (www.asrm.org) and the Society for Assisted \\nReproductive Technologies (www.sart.org) provide standards for \\nthe practice of reproductive medicine. But Moffitt said many of \\nthese so-called egg hunters are usually not SART-certified.  \"As far as the Internet is concerned, the good news is that \\nwe can work with couples from as far away as Australia and \\nallow them instant access to hundreds of donors,\" Smith said.  \"But the bad news is that it objectifies the donors and \\ntakes away the human contact people should feel when they are \\nbuilding their families. It\\'s not like buying a car from a \\ncatalog,\" she said.  The egg donation process at certified centers takes various \\nsteps. The potential recipient and the sperm of the would-be \\nfather are tested to make sure a pregnancy is viable.  Donors are screened psychologically and for infectious \\ndiseases and take hormones to induce the production of several \\neggs, while the recipient takes hormones to get her menstrual \\ncycle in sync with the donor\\'s.  The recipient undergoes anesthesia when eggs are retrieved \\nand then prepared for fertilization in a lab. Two to three days \\nafter they are fertilized, the embryos are ready to be \\ntransferred to the recipient\\'s uterus.  Smith said her program usually takes two to three months, \\nstarting with a consultation with the recipients, who then \\nselect a donor with the help of a coordinator. The $5,550 fee \\ncovers attorneys, insurance and meetings with a licensed \\ngeneticist.  Smith said some red flags to watch for when searching egg \\ndonor sites is whether or not they have a post office box, \\ncarry liability insurance or have licensed practitioners.  \"There are Web sites built by people who are profiting from \\nthe desperation of infertile couples and who walk away in the \\nmiddle of the cycle,\" she said, adding that she knows of \\ncouples who have lost almost $25,000 in some cases.  She also warned of the bait-and-switch tactic used by sites \\nwhich often post a beautiful egg donor who in fact is no longer \\ndonating eggs despite their claims to the contrary.  \"It\\'s absurd that we have this business involving the \\ncreation of life and it\\'s completely unregulated,\" said \\nHarvard\\'s Spar, author of \"The Baby Business: How Money Science \\nand Politics Drive the Commerce of Conception.\" The book, she \\nsays, is an argument for regulation of the industry.  \"While most people tied to these sites are from the medical \\nindustry, there are some bad players, which is why I argue that \\nregulation is in the best interest of all players,\" she said.',\n",

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumers packed malls and store \\nparking lots over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend, \\nleading many to expect this year\\'s holiday sales figures could \\nblow away expectations and lift retail stocks. \\n\\n  But early anecdotal data suggest heavy discounting drove \\ndemand. If that\\'s true, sales gains will likely be less than \\nlast year and retail stocks could tread water for the remainder \\nof the year.  \"You already know it\\'s a high traffic day,\" said Laura \\nRichardson, a consumer analyst at BB&T Capital Markets. \"What \\nI\\'m looking at is traffic relative to what I\\'m used to seeing \\nand the promotional efforts retailers are making. A lot of \\ncompanies I follow are cutting (prices) more than last year and \\nnot getting great traffic. That\\'s not a great sign for sales or \\nprofits.\"  Early-bird \"doorbuster\" promotions had customers lining up \\noutside stores like electronics retailer Best Buy Co. Inc. \\n( BBY.N ) before dawn on Friday. But the deals that attracted \\nthem, like Panasonic Plasma high-definition televisions for \\nless than $1,000, were just the same tactics retailers have \\nused the last couple of years, said Michael McNamara, vice \\npresident of research and analysis for MasterCard\\'s \\nSpendingPulse.  Retailers \"see traffic like this every year,\" McNamara \\nsaid, adding that he was surprised by the amount of buzz \\ngenerated by photos showing consumers pushing and shoving for \\nthe season\\'s hot toys and electronic gadgets.  Indeed, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) predicted a rare \\ndecline in monthly sales on Saturday, even as U.S. bargain \\nhunters jammed stores at the start of the holiday season.  The world\\'s biggest retailer estimated that November sales \\nfell 0.1 percent at its U.S. stores open at least a year -- a \\nclosely watched retail measure known as same-store sales.  The company had cut prices on some popular toys and other \\nholiday items as early as October, eager to revive growth after \\nback-to-back months of disappointing sales in September and \\nOctober, but Saturday\\'s report suggested that the early \\ndiscounts were not enough to reverse the poor sales trend.  The National Retail Federation trade group said on Saturday \\nit was leaving its holiday sales growth prediction unchanged at \\n5 percent, down from last year\\'s 6.1 percent growth. The \\ngroup\\'s spokesman Scott Krugman said there was nothing in \\nFriday\\'s sales activity to change its forecast.  Overall, sales momentum was a little slower heading into \\n2006 season. Last year, the United States was showing \\nyear-over-year growth of 7 to 10 percent, excluding auto sales, \\nheading into the holiday season. This year is a different \\nstory, with growth rates of 2 to 5 percent.\\n  HUGE TRAFFIC  Still, there\\'s no denying that store traffic trounced many \\nretailers\\' expectations.  Chelsea Property Group Inc. opened 25 of its 36 outlet \\ncenters at midnight after Thanksgiving. Lines formed at the \\nmost popular stores including Gap Inc.\\'s ( GPS.N ) Banana \\nRepublic and Gap, as well as Coach Inc.\\'s ( COH.N ) outlet stores \\nhours before the doors swung open, said representative Michele \\nRothstein.  \"Because of so much excitement, we had people show up at \\ncenters we didn\\'t even open (at midnight),\" Rothstein said. \"We \\nwill have to look at this (concept) across the board because it \\nappears that the consumer has really taken to this concept of \\nthe early open.\"  She said it was too early to evaluate sales, but Chelsea \\nProperty Group, which is a division of Simon Property Group \\nInc. ( SPG.N ), suspected that higher traffic from the year \\nbefore also meant higher sales.  \"I was blown away,\" said Beth Ann Schroeder, Disney Store \\n( PLCE.O ) division manager for the Northern New Jersey and New \\nYork area. \"I think sales were higher and traffic was higher. \\nThe two definitely go together.\"  She said demand was particularly strong for the promotional \\ntoys such as items related to the Disney animated movie \"Cars\" \\nand the Barbie 12 Dancing Princesses line.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks could face a challenge next week to bounce back from Friday\\'s post-Thanksgiving drop unless there\\'s some tempering of the dollar\\'s weakness that sparked the sell-off. \\n\\n Early signs of how the U.S. holiday shopping season is shaping up also will drive the week\\'s activity, as will a full agenda of economic data. Investors will review readings on economic growth, inflation, consumer confidence and manufacturing activity, among other data. The week will wrap up with the latest sales figures from the struggling U.S. auto sector. \"We may be entering a period of trouble for stocks and a sharp drop in the dollar may provide more excuses to sell,\" said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. U.S. stocks fell on Friday, retreating from highs reached earlier in the week, on concern that U.S. shares became less attractive to foreigners after a steep drop in the U.S. dollar. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 46.78 points, or 0.38 percent, to end at 12,280.17. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 5.14 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish at 1,400.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 5.72 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 2,460.26. For the week, the Dow slipped 0.51 percent and the S&P 500 inched down just 0.02 percent. But the Nasdaq gained 0.59 percent. The dollar sank against the euro  EUR=  on Friday, propelling Europe\\'s single currency up to around $1.31 for the first time since April 2005. THE SOUND OF SHOPPING Still, Wall Street hopes that the stampede of Americans to the malls over the long Thanksgiving Day holiday weekend will translate into strong sales. If enough people buy gifts instead of just browse, some retailers\\' shares may extend Friday\\'s gains into next week. The Friday after Thanksgiving is known as \"Black Friday\" because it is the first day of the Christmas shopping season. In years past, this was the day when retailers rang up enough sales to shift from red ink into \"the black\" by turning a profit for the year. The Thanksgiving weekend accounts for 9 percent to 10 percent of holiday sales, according to data compiled by the Telsey Group, an independent research firm. The Standard & Poor\\'s retail group expects a 4.5 percent increase in holiday retail sales for the traditional November-through-December period. <ID:nN24333041> \"Stocks will need help next week and strong retail sales may support some names,\" said Metz of Oppenheimer. Shares of Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, which operates Macy\\'s and Bloomingdale\\'s, rose 0.1 percent, or 4 cents, to close at $43.11 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Preppy clothing retailer J. Crew Group JCG.N turned in one of the best performances in the retail sector on Friday, when its shares shot up 6.8 percent, or $2.76, to $43.28 on the NYSE. Brown Shoe Co. ( BWS.N ), operator of the Famous Footwear chain, climbed 1.6 percent, or 72 cents, to $46.46. GameStop Inc. ( GME.N ), the largest U.S. video game retailer, had a good day.

A NUMBERS BLITZ Reports on durable goods orders and existing home sales for October plus consumer confidence for November will come out on Tuesday, kicking off next week\\'s heavy calendar of economic data. Durable goods orders probably fell 4.6 percent in October after an 8.3 percent jump in September, according to economists polled by Reuters. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders are expected to rise 0.2 percent in October, following September\\'s gain of 0.5 percent. The pace of existing home sales is expected to slip to 6.15 million units on an annualized basis in October from 6.18 million in September, according to the Reuters poll. For details, see ID: <ECI/US> Economists see the Conference Board\\'s consumer confidence index edging up to 106.0 in November from October\\'s 105.4. On Wednesday, more numbers will fly. The U.S. government will report its preliminary third-quarter GDP figures, which include an inflation gauge called the core PCE index, widely followed by the Federal Reserve\\'s policy-makers. The preliminary GDP figures, which will be the government\\'s second look at third-quarter gross domestic product, may be revised to an annual gain of 1.8 percent, up from 1.6 percent reported previously. The reading on core personal consumption expenditure prices, or the core PCE prices index, is expected to be a gain of 2.3 percent in the third quarter, matching the rate previously reported. The core reading excludes food and energy prices. The GDP release is due on Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) Some analysts said a positive reading on GDP figures may give investors a reason to buy stocks next week. \"As long as we can avoid a recession in the first part of next year, we think stocks will have modest gains,\" said Benjamin Halliburton, managing director of Tradition Capital Management in Summit, New Jersey. New home sales for October are due on Wednesday, with the Reuters poll calling for a dip to an annual pace of 1.044 million units from September\\'s 1.075 million. The government also will release a monthly reading on the core PCE price index on Thursday as part of the October data on personal income and personal consumption. Economists polled by Reuters expect the core PCE price index to rise 0.1 percent in October, after a 0.2 percent gain in September. Personal income is forecast up 0.5 percent and personal consumption is seen up 0.1 percent in October, matching September\\'s gains.

Economists see the Chicago PMI at 54.0 in November, compared with October\\'s 53.5. The Institute for Supply Management, or the ISM, manufacturing index for November will come out on Friday, along with October figures for construction spending. The Reuters poll forecasts: ISM\\'s November manufacturing index at 51.5 versus 51.2 in October, with October construction spending seen down 0.3 percent, matching September\\'s drop. November domestic car and truck sales will be released on Friday, wrapping up the week\\'s torrent of data. Economists see domestic car sales at a pace of 5.30 million units in November, up from October\\'s rate of 5.10 million. They peg domestic truck sales at a pace of 7.30 million units, up from October\\'s rate of 7.20 million. \"There are definitely some warning signs on the horizon\" for the economy and stocks, said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer of Bingham Legg Advisers in Boston. \"But I think if we look short-term, we still have lots of reasons to be optimistic.\" (Wall St Week Ahead runs weekly.

PDVSA said in a statement that \"an operational event was registered that affected a furnace of the Hydrosulfurization Unit Number 4 of the Amuay refinery\" at 9:21 p.m. on Friday night.\" The El Nacional newspaper on Saturday reported an explosion at Amuay and blackouts in the neighboring towns, citing witnesses in the area. PDVSA\\'s statement did not define the operational event and did not confirm whether or not it had been an explosion. The unit was in startup, PDVSA said, following a maintenance stoppage announced in September. It added that there had been no injuries, that other refinery units had not been affected, and that the company did not expect the event to affect fuel supply commitments. The company usually guarantees that it\\'s product sales will not be affected by PDVSA officials did not answer repeated phone calls from Reuters requesting clarification. PDVSA has suffered from frequent operational problems this year, including a massive fire at an Amuay crude distillation unit in July and an explosion at the neighboring Cardon refinery in March that killed two workers.

       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar fell sharply on Friday, pushing the euro above $1.31 for the first time since April 2005, on concerns about central banks diversifying their reserves and the greenback\\'s narrowing yield advantage over other currencies. \\n\\n The dollar\\'s fourth consecutive session of weakness was the culmination of a host of negative developments over the last several weeks, including weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data and comments from central banks in Asia and the Middle East underscoring the risk of keeping large reserves of dollars. \"It is the aggregate accumulation of these bearish bits and pieces that has the dollar on the defensive,\" said Dennis Gartman, an independent investment advisor who writes the Gartman Letter. The euro had risen to its highest in 19 months, at $1.3109  EUR= , a little more than 5 cents away from a record high set in late 2004. By mid-afternoon it was trading at $1.3100, up 1.2 percent from Thursday. Sterling was up 0.9 percent at $1.9320  GBP= , having hit a near two-year high of $1.9350, while the dollar sank to its lowest since June 2006 against the Swiss franc, at 1.2075 francs  CHF= . The dollar was down 0.5 percent at 115.75 yen  JPY= , after dropping to a 2-1/2-month low against the low-yielding Japanese currency because of a broad unwinding of carry trades. In such trades, an investor would borrow yen and invest in assets denominated in a higher-yielding currency. \"The triggering of stop loss orders on Friday has intensified carry trade liquidation in a low liquidity environment,\" said Kathy Lien, chief strategist with Forex Capital Markets in New York. Dealers also said the sharp drop in the dollar overnight had wrongfooted some in the market, prompting a bout of rapid-fire short covering and a subsequent spike in volatility, which only weighed further on the dollar. In the options market, implied volatility of 1-month to 1-year euro/dollar contracts rose sharply, suggesting heavy demand to buy options in anticipation of higher prices and higher spot market levels. Next week\\'s heavy slate of U.S. economic releases, including the ISM manufacturing activity index, a gauge of core inflation and a revised look at growth in gross domestic product in the third quarter, could determine whether the dollar sustains this week\\'s losses. \"We\\'ve had some pretty good numbers out of Europe, and so the risk for me is that over the next few weeks, we get some more sloppy data out of the United States in the manufacturing and housing sectors,\" Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist with TD Securities in Toronto. Thin volume has contributed to the dollar\\'s 2 percent decline this week against a basket of major currencies .DXY, its largest weekly fall since at least July. Indeed, there were few catalysts overnight for the dollar\\'s latest drop. Wu Xiaoling, vice governor of the People\\'s Bank of China, said in an academic paper that the reserves of East Asian nations were at risk from too much exposure to the falling dollar. Investors are wary that China, which holds the world\\'s biggest foreign exchange reserves of more than $1 trillion, might diversify out of dollar assets. Such speculation helped the euro rise to a record high above $1.36 in late 2004. Market positioning won\\'t be a factor preventing a further decline in the dollar anytime soon. Even though the greenback has sold off, JPMorgan said, speculative investors are holding a net short dollar position that\\'s 1.1 times the average position of the last 12 months, the largest since early October. But that is not nearly as large as the 5 times average in April. Short positions are essentially bets that an asset price will fall.',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - This year\\'s \"Black Friday\" could be the strongest opening to the holiday shopping season in years if the droves of Americans eager to exploit early-bird specials are any guide. \\n\\n Terry Lundgren, chief executive of Federated Department Stores Inc., told Reuters he arrived at the company\\'s flagship Macy\\'s store in Manhattan at 5:30 a.m. to find lines wrapped completely around the building, which takes up a whole city block. \"I\\'ve been coming here for many years at the same time on this particular day, and this looks like the largest crowd we\\'ve seen in years,\" Lundgren said. The sunny, cold weather was good for shopping, especially for coats and cashmere sweaters, he added. Early shoppers were treated to deals such as a five-piece luggage set for $49.99 and a one-carat diamond circle pendant for less than $100, Lundgren said. Consumers see the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday -- called \"Black Friday\" because it once marked the day many retailers turned a profit, or went into the black, for the year -- as the first day of the holiday shopping season and a time to snag bargains, freebies and sales. It used to be the year\\'s busiest shopping day, but people looking for last-minute gifts have transferred that honor to the Saturday before Christmas. Still, the Thanksgiving weekend accounts for up to 10 percent of holiday sales, according to analyst Dana Telsey of independent research firm Telsey Group. \"We were extremely surprised by how promotional the circulars and the advertisements have been,\" said Ellen Davis, senior director of the National Retail Federation. \"Retailers really went all-out to offer some substantial discounts this weekend to bring people into their stores.\" \"Everything we\\'ve seen indicates that consumers are responding,\" Davis said, adding that people were lined up across the country, trying to get bargains on toys, electronics and accessories. Britt Beemer, chairman of America\\'s Research Group, said 64 percent of respondents in a survey he conducted said they planned to shop early, lured by a flurry of early-bird specials, up from 48 percent last year. People even spent the night outside the Mall of America, near Minneapolis, Minnesota, in order to grab gift-bags offered to the first 250 people in line at the mall\\'s gingerbread house. The enthusiasm even extended online. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\\'s Web site saw a bigger-than-expected traffic surge early on Friday that caused temporary problems accessing the site. But a spokeswoman said that Friday-only deals that originally had been slated to end at 11 a.m. PST would be extended through midnight. Toys \"R\" Us Chief Executive Gerald Storch said this year\\'s hot toys -- such as T.M.X. Elmo and video-game consoles Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii -- made for more exciting selections than in years past. He said Toys \"R\" Us, which opened at 5 a.m., started the day with thousands of plush Elmo toys, but a sales associate at the company\\'s flagship store in New York\\'s Times Square said just after 6:30 a.m. that it had sold out. About Nintendo\\'s game console, which launched on November 19, Storch said the store had already sold tens of thousands and would have tens of thousands more available soon. \"It may not be in stock every hour of every day at every store,\" Storch told Reuters. \"But we are constantly getting replenishment of Nintendo Wiis.\" Laura Richardson, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, said the stocks of companies that sell electronics, including Best Buy Co. Inc., Circuit City Stores Inc. and Staples Inc. would be among the winners this season. \"Best Buy was just unbelievable,\" Richardson said of the crowds at the Tysons Corner, Virginia, outpost of the retailer. \"It was so bad I couldn\\'t even wait in the line.\" Best Buy is selling a 42-inch Panasonic Plasma high-definition television for just under $1,000. Retailers this year used special promotions and longer hours to attract consumers, some of whom have been spending less because of higher interest rates. In some cases, long lines to get into stores and at check-out counters caused some shoppers to have second thoughts. Monique Hand and a friend left home in Paterson, New Jersey, at 2:30 a.m., bound for New York\\'s Woodbury Common outlet center, which opened at midnight. But when they arrived two hours later, the crowds, lines and a full parking lot were too much to handle, Hand said. The women headed back to New Jersey\\'s Westfield Garden State Plaza, which did not open until 7 a.m. but promised free coffee and massages to early birds. \"I\\'ll never do this again,\" said Hand\\'s companion, who preferred not to give her name. Disney Stores, many of which opened at 5 a.m., were discounting their entire stock by 20 percent until 10 a.m. And Manhattan\\'s famed toy emporium FAO Schwarz didn\\'t bother to wait until Friday. It opened its doors on Thanksgiving Day. Jeff Dugan, an office technology manager who came shopping with his wife at the Garden State Mall after they could not get into the parking lot of a Best Buy in West Paterson, New Jersey, at 6 a.m., said getting up so early was not worth it. \"Our plan didn\\'t work ... we came out too late at 6 a.m.,\" Dugan said. Trading in retail stocks was thin on Friday, with the Standard & Poor\\'s Retail index closing down less than 1 percent. Best Buy shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $55.08, down 76 cents, while Wal-Mart closed at $47.90, down 13 cents.

       "  ' CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. predicted a rare decline in monthly sales on Saturday, even as U.S. bargain-hunters jammed stores in search of gifts at the start of the crucial holiday shopping season. \\n\\n Wal-Mart, the world\\'s biggest retailer, sounded a cautious note for retailers as they began a second day of Thanksgiving weekend sales with deep discounts and early bird specials on items ranging from cashmere sweaters to big-screen plasma televisions. Wal-Mart estimated that November sales fell 0.1 percent at its U.S. stores open at least a year -- a closely watched retail measure known as same-store sales. The retailer will provide a final monthly sales report on Thursday, when most other major chain stores report their November figures. This would mark Wal-Mart\\'s first monthly same-store sales decline since April 1996. Wal-Mart had expected same-store sales to be flat compared with the same period last year, which many Wall Street analysts had viewed as disappointing. Wal-Mart\\'s four-week November sales period ended on Friday. \"We would frankly have expected better,\" Merrill Lynch retail analyst Virginia Genereux wrote in a note to clients dated Friday, pointing out that Wal-Mart had slashed prices on popular toys, electronics and other gift items to lure customers. The retailer\\'s widely publicized $4 generic drug program should have drawn more shoppers, too. Investors are watching holiday sales particularly closely this year to gauge how consumers are coping with a slowdown in the housing market that has already hurt home improvement retailers and furniture stores. Consumer spending accounts for some two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, and the November-December holiday season makes up anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent of retailers\\' annual sales. The National Retail Federation trade group expects holiday sales growth of about 5 percent, which would be a slowdown from last year\\'s surprisingly strong 6.1 percent gain. $1,200 HAND-MADE TOYS Department store chain J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its holiday season was off to a good start, with brisk foot traffic and strong demand for categories such as home entertainment, jewelry, children\\'s clothing and housewares. Famed toy retailer FAO Schwarz kept its stores open on Thanksgiving Day, and reported strong demand for hand-made wooden toys -- some of which sold for $1,200 apiece. At its New York flagship store, Thanksgiving Day sales were flat, which the company attributed to bad weather, while its Las Vegas store saw a 45 percent sales increase. \"I see people buying better, what I call \\'antiquity\\', presents that are better made, more durable -- things I view as generational presents,\" Ed Schmults, chief executive, told Reuters in an interview. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman declined to comment on its Black Friday sales, but said the retailer will provide those details along with its sales report on Thursday. Wal-Mart began cutting prices as early as October instead of the usual November. The retailer is eager to revive growth after back-to-back months of disappointing sales in September and October, but Saturday\\'s report suggested that the early discounts were not enough to reverse the poor sales trend. Stores were packed on Friday, the traditional start to the holiday shopping season, and retailers were pushing another round of discounts on Saturday to keep shoppers coming back. The NRF trade group expects some 137 million Americans to go shopping this weekend. But big crowds don\\'t necessarily mean strong sales. Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis at MasterCard\\'s SpendingPulse, noted that while hot items such as the PlayStation 3 video game system have generated considerable buzz, they are only a tiny portion of retailers\\' overall sales. He said rather than focusing on Black Friday crowds, investors should pay close attention to October sales trends, which showed a dramatic slowdown in growth year-over-year heading into the holiday season. \"You\\'re looking at (sales) growth rates that are about half of what they were last year,\" he said. \"The momentum that we have coming in is definitely down several notches.\" (Additional reporting by  Chelsea Emery  in New York)',\n",

Consumer spending accounts for some two-thirds of U.S. \\neconomic activity, and the November-December holiday season \\nmakes up anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent of retailers\\' \\nannual sales.  The National Retail Federation trade group expects holiday \\nsales growth of about 5 percent, which would be a slowdown from \\nlast year\\'s surprisingly strong 6.1 percent gain.\\n  $1,200 HAND-MADE TOYS  Department store chain J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) said \\nits holiday season was off to a good start, with brisk foot \\ntraffic and strong demand for categories such as home \\nentertainment, jewelry, children\\'s clothing and housewares.  Famed toy retailer FAO Schwarz kept its stores open on \\nThanksgiving Day, and reported strong demand for hand-made \\nwooden toys -- some of which sold for $1,200 apiece.  At FAO Schwarz\\'s flagship store in New York, Thanksgiving \\nDay sales were flat, which the company attributed to \\nbadweather, while its Las Vegas store saw a 45 percent sales \\nincrease.  \"I see people buying better, what I call \\'antiquity\\', \\npresents that are better made, more durable -- things I view as \\ngenerational presents,\" Ed Schmults, the chief executive, told \\nReuters in an interview.  Wayne Best, a senior economist at Visa USA, said steep \\ndiscounts helped spur the strongest sales on Black Friday at \\nfurniture and home furnishings stores and electronics and \\nappliance stores. In the later category, the average ticket \\nrose 9 percent, he said.  Discount and department stores saw much softer growth, Best \\nsaid. Visa is expected on Monday to release its sales data for \\nBlack Friday -- so named because retailers traditionally become \\nprofitable for the year on the day after Thanksgiving.  A Wal-Mart spokeswoman declined to comment on its Black \\nFriday sales, but said the retailer will provide those details \\nalong with its sales report on Thursday.  Stores were packed on Friday, the traditional start to the \\nholiday shopping season, and retailers were pushing another \\nround of discounts on Saturday to keep shoppers coming back. \\nThe NRF trade group expected some 137 million Americans to go \\nshopping this weekend.  But big crowds don\\'t necessarily mean strong sales.  Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis \\nat MasterCard\\'s SpendingPulse, noted that while hot items such \\nas the PlayStation 3 video game system have generated buzz, \\nthey are only a tiny portion of retailers\\' overall sales.  He said rather than focusing on Black Friday crowds, \\ninvestors should pay close attention to October sales trends, \\nwhich showed a dramatic slowdown in growth year-over-year \\nheading into the holiday season.  \"You\\'re looking at (sales) growth rates that are about half \\nof what they were last year,\" he said. \"The momentum that we \\nhave coming in is definitely down several notches.\"  (Additional reporting by  Chelsea Emery  in New York and \\n Alexandria Sage  in Los Angeles)',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumers packed malls and store \\nparking lots over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend, \\nleading many to expect this year\\'s holiday sales figures could \\nblow away expectations and lift retail stocks. \\n\\n  But early anecdotal data suggest heavy discounting drove \\ndemand. If that\\'s true, sales gains could be less than last \\nyear and retail stocks could tread water for the remainder of \\nthe year.  \"You already know it\\'s a high traffic day,\" said Laura \\nRichardson, a consumer analyst at BB&T Capital Markets. \"What \\nI\\'m looking at is traffic relative to what I\\'m used to seeing \\nand the promotional efforts retailers are making. A lot of \\ncompanies I follow are cutting (prices) more than last year and \\nnot getting great traffic. That\\'s not a great sign for sales or \\nprofits.\"  Early-bird \"doorbuster\" promotions had customers lining up \\noutside stores like electronics retailer Best Buy Co. Inc. \\n( BBY.N ) before dawn on Friday. But the deals that attracted \\nthem, like high-definition televisions for less than $1,000, \\nwere just the same tactics retailers have used the last couple \\nof years, said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and \\nanalysis for MasterCard\\'s SpendingPulse.  Retailers \"see traffic like this every year,\" McNamara \\nsaid, adding that he was surprised by the amount of buzz \\ngenerated by photos showing consumers pushing and shoving for \\nthe season\\'s hot toys and electronic gadgets.  Indeed, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) predicted a rare \\ndecline in monthly sales on Saturday, even as bargain hunters \\njammed stores at the start of the holiday season.  The world\\'s biggest retailer estimated that November sales \\nfell 0.1 percent at its U.S. stores open at least a year -- a \\nclosely watched retail measure known as same-store sales.  The company had cut prices on some popular toys and other \\nholiday items as early as October, eager to revive growth after \\nback-to-back months of disappointing sales in September and \\nOctober. But Saturday\\'s report suggested the early discounts \\nwere not enough to reverse the poor sales trend.\\n  GROWTH PREDICTION UNCHANGED  The National Retail Federation trade group said it was \\nleaving its holiday sales growth prediction unchanged at 5 \\npercent, down from last year\\'s 6.1 percent.  Overall, sales momentum was a little slower heading into \\n2006 season. Last year, the United States was showing \\nyear-over-year growth of 7 to 10 percent, excluding auto sales, \\nheading into the holiday season. This year is a different \\nstory, with growth rates of 2 to 5 percent.  One economist said it appeared that shoppers took advantage \\nof hefty discounts to buy big-ticket items for themselves, \\nrather than as gifts, the opposite of last year\\'s trend.  Wayne Best, senior economist at Visa USA, said the two \\nstrongest growth categories on \"Black Friday\" -- retail\\'s first \\nholiday shopping day -- were furniture and home furnishings as \\nwell as electronics and appliances, where the average ticket \\nprice rose a higher-than-expected 9 percent.  \"Clearly that meant people were buying more items or more \\nexpensive items,\" he said.  Visa is expected to release sales figures on Monday, but \\neven without hard data, there\\'s no denying that store traffic \\ntrounced many retailers\\' expectations.  Chelsea Property Group Inc. opened 25 of its 36 outlet \\ncenters at midnight after Thanksgiving.

       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Stung by criticism that it conspired to kill the electric car, General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) is preparing to detail its commitment to new fuel-saving technologies, including new electric vehicles, according to people familiar with the automaker\\'s plans. \\n\\n GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner will use an appearance at the Los Angeles Auto Show this week to highlight a development program the automaker hopes will be seen as a strategic shift and help distance it from its reputation as a company focused first on gas-guzzling trucks, people briefed on the presentation said. The effort is part of GM\\'s bid to demonstrate how it is investing some of the $9 billion saved through a wrenching program of job cuts and plant closures in technology, including hybrids, an area where it has lagged Toyota Motor Co. ( 7203.T ) GM is likely to wait until the Detroit auto show in January to comment in depth on its future electric vehicle plans, but Wagoner will discuss the company\\'s strategy in Los Angeles on Wednesday, people with knowledge of the plans said. GM recognizes that to change consumer attitudes about the quality of its brands it has to address the criticism that it has not done enough to drive advances in fuel economy -- an especially key concern in California, said one GM executive, who asked not to be named ahead of the announcement. California, the most populous and richest U.S. state, has become increasingly hostile ground for the Detroit automakers, who have watched Toyota ride its reputation for quality and fuel-efficiency to a dominating No. 1 position in the local market. GM\\'s reputation in California suffered further from the controversy that surrounded this summer\\'s release of the film \"Who Killed the Electric Car?\" The critically hailed documentary focused on the role the world\\'s largest automaker played in the decision to end California\\'s experiment with all-electric cars that many environmentalists still see as the most promising alternative to gas engines. GM declined to comment on upcoming product plans, but a spokesman said the company would provide more detail on its investment in fuel-saving technologies in coming weeks. \"Technology is an area where we have seen an acceleration in our efforts in the past few years, and it\\'s safe to say we\\'ll be providing more information on this,\" GM spokesman Chris Preuss said. One area that GM will highlight is its effort to develop a new \"series hybrid,\" a vehicle that would use a gas-engine to generate power only for an electric motor that would drive the car. GM has also been developing a plug-in electric hybrid vehicle under the internal code-named I-Car. Wagoner is not expected to provide more details on that program until next year, people briefed on the plans said. Environmental advocates and utilities in California have been pushing GM and other car companies to move such rechargeable vehicles into production, citing their potential to push gas mileage to 100 miles-per-gallon and beyond by running only on battery power for short trips. GM has its first hybrid vehicle on the U.S. market now, the Saturn VUE Green Line SUV. It has also announced plans to introduce hybrid versions of its Yukon and Tahoe SUVs by late 2007 using technology it has jointly developed with BMW AG ( BMWG.DE ) and DaimlerChrysler AG.DCXGn.DE Hybrid versions of GM\\'s Saturn Aura and the GMC Yukon are expected to be on display at the Los Angeles show. Ron Cogan the editor of the California-based Green Car Journal, said that upcoming \"two-mode\" hybrid system, which uses two sets of gears and two electric motors, promises to keep costs of future hybrid vehicles down, reducing a major barrier to their more widespread use. \"I think this might be a coming out party for GM,\" Cogan said. \"They have been beat up a lot in the past about not having a hybrid out and lagging Toyota.\" Chelsea Sexton, a former GM employee who featured in \"Who Killed the Electric Car?\" and now works with the clean-car advocacy group Plug In America, said GM deserved credit for coming \"full circle\" on electric car technology. \"I have a lot of history with GM,\" she said. \"But I think we have to be cautiously optimistic.\"',\n",
       "  ' NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks could start the week lower after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), a key barometer of the U.S. retail sector, forecast a decline in monthly sales, signaling caution about the holiday shopping season. \\n\\n The news could put a damper on the retail group, even though analysts and stores reported heavy traffic over the Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start of the U.S. holiday shopping season, analysts said. Wal-Mart, the world\\'s biggest retailer, estimated that November sales fell 0.1 percent at U.S. stores open at least a year. This would mark Wal-Mart\\'s first monthly same-store sales decline since April 1996.  \"You can\\'t argue that it is a Wal-Mart specific problem because in essence, Wal-Mart is a pretty good representation of the whole economy,\" said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Client Services in New York. Peter Dunay, investment strategist at Leeb Capital Management in New York, said, \"It\\'s not a good time (for the retailer) to run into bumps.\" Some major retail stocks rose on Friday, and those gains could be extended after positive reports of shopping activity on Saturday and Sunday. But analysts noted that retail shares have already bounced back from mid-July lows and are up more than 10 percent year to day. A full slate of economic data will also influence stocks this week, as investors review readings on economic growth, inflation, consumer confidence and manufacturing activity. The week will wrap up with the latest sales figures from the struggling U.S. auto sector. Stocks are seen bouncing back this week after Friday\\'s post-Thanksgiving drop unless there is some tempering of the dollar\\'s weakness that sparked a sell-off.     . \"We may be entering a period of trouble for stocks, and a sharp drop in the dollar may provide more excuses to sell,\" said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. U.S. stocks fell on Friday, retreating from highs earlier in the week, on concern that U.S. shares became less attractive to foreigners after a steep drop in the dollar. For last week, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 0.51 percent to end Friday at 12,280.17, while the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  dipped 0.02 percent for the week and finished Friday\\'s short trading session at 1,400.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  also declined modestly, closing at 2,460.26. But for the week, the Nasdaq advanced 0.59 percent. The dollar sank against the euro  EUR=  Friday, propelling Europe\\'s single currency up to around $1.31 for the first time since April 2005. Yet the three major U.S. stock indexes are up year to date. The Dow industrials index is up 14.58 percent for 2006 so far, while the S&P 500 has added 12.23 percent, and the Nasdaq has gained 11.56 percent. U.S. crude oil futures rose to almost $60 a barrel in thin electronic trading in London on Friday. The New York Mercantile Exchange was closed Thursday and Friday for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. On Wednesday, NYMEX January crude CLF7 settled at $59.24 a barrel -- up from $58.97 a week ago. RETAILERS GAIN ON BLACK FRIDAY The Friday after Thanksgiving is known as \"Black Friday\" because in years retailers rang up enough sales to shift into \"the black,\" or turning a profit for the year. It is considered to be the start of the Christmas shopping season. The Thanksgiving weekend accounts for 9 percent to 10 percent of holiday sales, according to data compiled by the Telsey Group, an independent research firm. The Standard & Poor\\'s retail group expects a 4.5 percent increase in holiday retail sales for the traditional November-through-December period. In Friday\\'s shortened trading session, shares of Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, which operates Macy\\'s and Bloomingdale\\'s, rose 4 cents to $43.11. Preppy clothing retailer J. Crew Group Inc. JCG.N turned in one of the best performances in the retail sector on Friday, when its stock shot up 6.8 percent, or $2.76, to $43.28. Staples Inc. ( SPLS.O ), the No. 1 office supplies retailer, on Sunday said traffic and sales exceeded expectations, helped by deeper inventory and efforts to make shopping easy. On Friday, Staples shares fell 1.1 percent to close at $25.62 on Nasdaq. DURABLE GOODS, HOMES AND GDP Reports on October durable goods orders and existing home sales for October as well as November consumer confidence will come out Tuesday, kicking off the week\\'s heavy calendar of economic data. Economists polled by Reuters expect that durable goods orders fell 4.6 percent in October after an 8.3 percent jump in September. The pace of existing home sales is expected to slip in October to 6.15 million units on an annualized basis from September\\'s 6.18 million. Economists see the Conference Board\\'s November consumer confidence index at 106.0, up from October\\'s 105.4. On Wednesday, the U.S. government will report preliminary third-quarter GDP figures, which include an inflation gauge called the core PCE index, widely followed by the Federal Reserve\\'s policymakers. The forecasts, according to the Reuters poll, are that preliminary third-quarter GDP growth may be revised to an annual gain of 1.8 percent, up from 1.6 percent reported previously. The reading on core personal consumption expenditure prices, or core PCE prices, excluding food and energy, is expected to be a gain of 2.3 percent in the third quarter, matching the rate previously reported. New home sales for October, due Wednesday, are forecast to dip to an annual pace of 1.044 million units from September\\'s 1.075 million. On Thursday, the government will release a monthly reading on the core PCE price index as part of the October data on personal income and personal consumption. Economists polled by Reuters expect the core PCE price index to rise 0.1 percent in October, after a 0.2 percent gain in September.

It is understood the reductions are likely to reach further than previous volume discounts at Europe\\'s largest share market, the paper reported. \"We have been bringing down the cost of trading over the last few years and we would expect to continue to do so. One of the reasons why is because every time we have we have seen an increase in trading activity,\" an LSE spokeswoman told Reuters on Sunday. On November 15 Citigroup ( C.N ), Credit Suissse ( CSGN.VX ), Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Merrill Lynch MER.N, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) said they planned to create a new pan-European trading platform next year. The seven investment banks -- which account for almost half of the exchange trading in European equities as well as being dominant players in off-exchange trading -- said their rival platform would take advantage of new European rules that come into force next November. The European Unions\\' Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) hopes to create a pan-European market in financial services that will ensure customers get value for money and greater transparency.

It also noted that Google now has the 15th largest market capitalization among U.S.-traded shares, and its price-to-earnings ratio is two to three times higher that of similarly sized companies. Analysts predicted a 33 percent gain in Google's earnings in 2007, versus the 81 percent increase the company is on track to produce this year, Barron's said. The paper added that the price that advertisers are willing to pay for search keywords has fallen. Slowing revenue growth would be painful for Google, Barron's said, because of its rising expenses.

The broader equity market is also up sharply from mid-year, with all three major U.S. stock indexes -- the Nasdaq Composite  .IXIC  the Standard & Poor\\'s 500  .SPX  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  -- racking up double-digit gains. \"There is not a lot of room for disappointment, and upside gains will probably be modest, even on really strong data,\" said Peter Dunay, investment strategist at Leeb Capital Management in New York. Most data has yet to be reported this early in the season, and investors and analysts are relying more on anecdotal reports of store traffic and item availability. Starting on Friday, many retailers opened before dawn to get a jump on the season, and shoppers lined up in parking lots in hopes of snagging hot items and special offers. But long lines are no sure indicator of good earnings, analysts said. \"The question is, do people have lots of spare cash, thanks to low gas prices? Or does this mean that money is a little tight, and they are camping out to get the deals because they are little nervous?\" said Barry Ritholtz, fund manager at Ritholtz Capital Partners in New York. On Saturday, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Its stock is up 12.8 percent year to date. \"Online and in-store traffic and dollar spending were very strong, right out of the chute,\" said Dave Perron, Staples\\' executive vice president of merchandising and supply chain. \"There were strong increases in both from last year.\" Retailers who have endured the lowest expectations this year may be the season\\'s winners. Visa USA, the largest U.S. credit card association, said in a statement on Sunday that home furnishings had the best year-over-year Black Friday growth despite the sharp slowdown in the housing market. J.C. Penney said home entertainment and housewares were among its strongest selling categories over the weekend. Overall, clothing, accessories and books, CDs and DVDs were the most popular items, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), which expects holiday sales growth of about 5 percent, a slowdown from last year\\'s surprisingly strong 6.1 percent gain. The NRF said Sunday that traffic to stores over the three-day holiday weekend was below last year\\'s levels -- approximately 140 million shoppers versus 145 million -- but found the average shopper spent 19 percent more than last year. \"It\\'s the higher-priced items that are going to drive sales. People are feeling like they\\'re not going to buy as much, but the ticket price on what they\\'re buying is going up,\" said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in San Francisco.

       "  ' LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - EBay was the online winner this \"Black Friday,\" data published on Saturday showed, but overall Internet traffic growth was well below last year\\'s even as bargain hunters tracked down sought-after toys and electronics on the Web before \"Cyber Monday.\" \\n\\n Overall traffic to the Nielsen/Net Ratings Holiday eShopping Index, which tracks more than 120 online retailers, rose 12 percent on the Friday after Thankgiving over the same day last year, according to the online audience measurement firm. That is significantly below the 29 percent growth in overall traffic to the index from 2004 to 2005 and more in line with 11 percent growth seen from 2003 to 2004. EBay Inc. had the most Web traffic on \"Black Friday,\" one of retail\\'s busiest days, with 7.5 million unique visitors, according to the data. Amazon.com was in second place, with 3.4 million unique visitors, followed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. with 3.2 million. There is no way to determine what percentage of Internet users are actually making Web purchases. The search for Mattel\\'s T.M.X. Elmo, this season\\'s most popular and hard-to-find toy, drove much of that online traffic in advance of \"Cyber Monday,\" the unofficial start of the online holiday shopping season. EBay reported that 2,537 T.M.X. Elmos were sold Friday for an average price of $70.10. The toy retails at Wal-Mart for $39.97 and can be found on Shopping.com for as much as $150. Other popular items on eBay included Sony\\'s PlayStation 3 -- 14,675 have been sold on eBay for an average price of $1,186.39 from November 17 to November 24 -- and the Nintendo Wii. Since that product debuted on November 19, 26,708 have been sold for an average price of $412.53. Shopping.com and Price Grabber.com, which allow consumers to compare deals from a variety of retailers, saw year-over-year jumps of 40 percent and 45 percent, respectively, in the volume of traffic on their sites. But traffic does not necessarily translate into higher sales. As shipping becomes faster and more reliable, more Internet shoppers are waiting longer into December to make purchases, but are browsing the Web for good deals. Wayne Best, a senior economist at Visa USA, said Internet-based sales on \"Black Friday\" fared worse than last year, which he attributed to fairly good weather across the country driving shoppers to malls. \"The overall sales were much softer in the non-store retailers than what we\\'ve seen previously,\" he said. Shopping.com Chief Executive Josh Silverman said the highest-growth categories in November so far were household goods and clothing, not electronics, which include hot items like plasma TVs and game consoles. \"Where three or four years ago it was younger males buying electronics, now more than half of our shoppers are women and the most popular categories online look a whole lot like the most popular categories offline,\" Silverman said. Electronics saw 16-percent year-over-year growth for November to date.',\n",

Both resigned, effective Sunday, and have entered into \\nseparation agreements that call for them to remain employees \\nthrough June 30, 2007, ACS said.  A company spokesman said that King and Edwards were \\nunavailable to comment.  ACS also said it expects to take a noncash expense of \\napproximately $51 million related to incorrect accounting \\nmeasurement dates, plus additional tax-related expenses.  The board investigation was initiated in response to an \\ninformal inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \\nand a subpoena from a federal grand jury in Manhattan. It \\nreviewed ACS\\'s stock option practices from 1994 through 2005.  More than 150 companies have launched internal \\ninvestigations or are the subject of probes by the federal \\nofficials to determine if dates of stock options grants were \\nmanipulated.  ACS shares rose 37 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $51.11 in \\nMonday midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange but were \\ndown four cents to $50.70 by early afternoon.  Goldman Sachs analyst Julio Quinteros said in a note to \\nclients that he viewed the news \"as a positive for the stock.\"  Vafi at Jefferies & Co. said the stock could rise further \\nover the next few weeks now that uncertainty surrounding the \\ninvestigation has been reduced.  ACS appointed Chief Operating Officer Lynn Blodgett as \\npresident and CEO. Blodgett, 52, has been with ACS since 1996, \\nwhen it acquired a company that he had founded. He has been a \\ncompany director since September 2005.  The company also named Executive Vice President of \\nCorporate Development John Rexford as CFO. Rexford, 49, joined \\nACS in 1996 as senior vice president for mergers and \\nacquisitions.  King\\'s lawyer, Karen Seymour, said in a statement that her \\nclient voluntarily resigned as CEO and \"cooperated fully\" with \\nthe investigation.  She added that he \"acted at all times in good faith and did \\nnot engage in any intentional misconduct.\"  The Wall Street Journal reported that Gary Naftalis, a \\nlawyer for Edwards, had noted that his client became CFO in \\n2001, years after the problems apparently started.  \"He engaged in no intentional misconduct and acted in good \\nfaith at all times in connection with the company\\'s \\nlong-standing and historic options granting practices,\" \\nNaftalis said, according to the newspaper.  Naftalis could not be reached for comment.  ACS said it was continuing to review the results of the \\ninvestigation to determine the accounting consequences of the \\nuse of incorrect measurement dates during 1994 through 2005.  The noncash expense of $51 million \"may increase or \\ndecrease when finalized,\" it said.  ACS added that it had not yet determined the impact of the \\naccounting adjustments on its financial statements \"nor whether \\nit will be required to restate its consolidated financial \\nstatements as a result of these adjustments.\"  (Additional reporting by  Jim Finkle  in Boston)',\n",
